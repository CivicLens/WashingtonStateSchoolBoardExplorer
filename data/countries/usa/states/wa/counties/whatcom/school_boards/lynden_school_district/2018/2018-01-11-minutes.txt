Lynden High School hosted an Inter-High event, bringing eight area schools together to collaborate on
ways to improve the student experience. ASB officers decided the topics would focus on school spirit and
student engagement. The purpose of this engagement is so kids go back with ideas to help their building.
Students shared ideas related to assemblies, dances, freshman mentoring and in-class club time.
Tess Carey's freshman and sophomore English classes are participating in Genius Hour that is part of a
larger national push to encourage students to select a community-minded project and follow-through with a
solution. In Genius Hour, students work on an inquiry project, something of their choosing. They will select
an area that excites them, identify problems within that area and then develop an inquiry question that
requires a tangible solution.
Lynden Academy's soon-to-be Grads are working hard preparing for their graduation banquet by
fundraising. Fundraising includes selling butter-braids, Lynden Academy wear, and pizza fundraisers!
Lynden Middle School students have embraced their Student Spotlight. Each week a student is recognized
for their acts of kindness and #LIONPRIDE.
Although Fisher's garden is not yet planted and producing, that hasn't stopped the students to engage
now with Common Threads, who will help plan, create and manage an on-site garden. In December they
kicked off the program with cooking classes. After preparing the dish while learning about the ingredients
along the way, they then had an opportunity to taste their creation.
Be the One Mentoring is bringing a free after-school improv class to the high school for 8 weeks.
Improvisational Theater allows students to develop communication, leadership, flexibility, and selfconfidence in a fun and safe environment.
January is School Board of Directors appreciation month. Thank you to our Board for their selfless service!
We are grateful for you and what you do for our students and community.
