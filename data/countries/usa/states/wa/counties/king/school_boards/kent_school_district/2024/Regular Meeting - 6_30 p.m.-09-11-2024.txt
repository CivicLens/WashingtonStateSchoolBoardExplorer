AGENDA ITEM:

Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Proclamation: September Attendance Awareness Month
Attendance Awareness Month is a nationwide event recognizing the connection between school attendance and academic achievement.
Improving student attendance is an essential, cost-effective strategy for ensuring our students are on-track to learn and succeed. Good
attendance matters for school success, beginning as early as prekindergarten and throughout elementary school. Developing the habit of
attendance prepares students for success on the job and in life. Nearly 50 national organizations are working in partnership to mobilize
schools and communities to promote the value of good attendance and to take steps toward reducing chronic absence.
The Board will proclaim September Attendance Awareness Month in the Kent School District.

Replacement of District-Wide POTS (Plain Old Telephone System) Lines
AGENDA ITEM:
The Kent School District is committed to maintaining reliable and secure communication services across
all school sites. As part of our ongoing efforts to modernize the district's telecommunications
infrastructure, the KSD IT department proposes entering a 3-year contract with Granite Communications
to replace our existing Lumens POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) lines, which have become
increasingly unreliable.
Recent legislative changes have allowed service providers to discontinue maintenance and repairs on
traditional POTS lines, further contributing to the instability of our current telecommunications
infrastructure. To address these challenges, Granite Communications will provide advanced EPIK lines
that meet or exceed the reliability of traditional POTS lines. These services will ensure uninterrupted
communication for critical systems, including elevators, red emergency phones, select fax machines, and
other essential analog devices.
The scope of the services includes:
EPIK Lines: Replacement of 103 Lumens POTS lines with Granite's EPIK technology across
multiple district sites. These lines offer enhanced reliability and built-in redundancy through dual
SIM cards on the T-Mobile and Verizon networks.
Granite Guardian Monitoring: 24/7 monitoring and emergency replacement services, providing
continuous support and rapid response to any service disruptions.
This purchase was made through the OMNIA cooperative purchasing agreement. Board Policy 6220
Purchasing and Contracting Bids and Contracts allows the District to leverage cooperative purchasing
agreements to satisfy competitive bidding requirements.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
The total cost for these services is $60,000 annually and includes all associated taxes and fees. The
expenses are forecasted to come from the districts Technology General Budget. We believe that this will
be a net cost savings over the current Lumens POTS line offering.
