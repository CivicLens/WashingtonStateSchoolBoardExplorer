## 2024-10-03 - LYNDEN_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Lynden School Board held a meeting where they discussed and prioritized WSSDA (Washington State School Directors' Association) positions for 2025.  The board reviewed a master list of priorities compiled from individual director rankings, ultimately approving a list that included "Transition to Kindergarten" and "Enhanced Funding for Transitional Bilingual Education". The board also approved a fuel bid from Reisner Distributing for the 24/25 school year.

During committee reports, Directors Brar and Martinez, part of the teaching & learning committee, briefly mentioned their meeting regarding sexual health curriculum and promised a more formal summary at a future meeting. This suggests the board is actively engaging with discussions surrounding inclusive sex education. The finance committee, composed of Directors Verburg and Martinez, discussed the district's contract with eResources for technology services and potential fund transfers.  The legislative committee, comprising Directors Hickman and Verburg, provided updates on the General Assembly and WSSDA's upcoming publication of its top ten priorities.
