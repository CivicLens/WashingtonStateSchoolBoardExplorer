We would like to acknowledgethat we gather on the ancestral homelands of the Coast Salish Peoples,
specifically Nooksack and Lummi tribes, who have lived in the Salish Sea basin, throughout the San Juan
Islands and the North Cascades watershed, from time immemorial. On behalf of everyone here, we want
to express our deepest respect and gratitude for our indigenous neighbors, the Nooksack and Lummi
tribes, for their enduring care and protection of our shared lands and waterways.
