A. Public Comment
The following individual addressed the board regarding a topic of concern:
Natalie Chavez commented on a recent school board candidate forum. She encouraged the board to listen to the audio recording which is accessible on KGMI's website.

Ms. Chavez also expressed concern that the Whatcom County Health Department is pushing hard for the establishment of school-based health clinics.
  3. Reports
A. School Administrator Monthly Reports
Teacher/Principal Jessie Hettinga shared highlights of the program at Point Roberts Primary School. Director Credyt commended her on the use of an online music program. Director Leu expressed appreciation that students are learning familiarity with library services.
  Monthly school administrator reports for Blaine schools were attached to the meeting agenda for review by the board. These were not presented during the meeting in Point Roberts. 
  B. Borderite Athletics Report
Athletics Director Chas Kok provided the board with a Borderite Athletics report. Most fall season sports have higher participation numbers. This includes swimming, and Mr. Kok described the new partnership with Squalicum High School to provide this aquatic program. He also described the NW Conference's focus as a regional community on raising the level of sportsmanship in athletic competitions. Mr. Kok also commented on the shortage of game officials.  The district's Coach Handbook has been well received and includes athletics policies as well as leadership guidance to improve collaboration and interactions with student athletes. Due to success with this handbook, other schools in the region have expressed an interest in replicating it for their programs. Director Creydt asked about sharing the handbook, and Mr. Kok affirmed that it is available on the GoBorderites.com website and in Final Forms. Director Leu congratulated Mr. Kok for focusing on sportsmanship and on the development of good character traits in Borderite athletes. Discussion followed, and Director Leu commented on the persistence shown by cross country athletes he has observed running in the community. President Thomas asked about the resources used for development of the Coach Handbook, and Mr. Kok described Brett Ledbetter's influence. He further explained that his first year was focused on learning the ins and outs of the Borderite athletic program. Now, in his second year, he is focused on building the program. President Thomas also congratulated Mr. Kok on the hiring of a new football coach which has resulted in a noticeable change for the better.
  C. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reviewed the report showing enrollment for the month of September which did not include the ALE, Running Start, or Open Doors programs. Ms. Porter explained that the Transition to Kindergarten (TTK) program now falls in a different category and will not be provided on this report. Ms. Porter shared comments on historical trends and discussion followed. She also explained that, although this year's kindergarten enrollment is higher than the budgeted level, decreases in other grades have resulted in the overall K-12 count being lower than the budgeted level. Director Leu asked several questions to clarify the potential financial impact from this low enrollment. Ms. Porter suggested that the evaluation could be better made when all of the data is available in October. Director Creydt asked which students are included in ALE counts, and Ms. Porter explained that ALE enrollment primarily comes from HomeConnection with a small amount also coming from the high school's contract-based ALE program. Ms. Porter estimated there will be approximately 42 additional FTE from ALE programs included in the October count. She further explained that ALE enrollment provides a lower level of funding than general education enrollment, but it does count in calculating levy revenue. Discussion continued. Director Creydt asked about students who were turned away, and there was clarification that only non-resident students were denied admission. Dr. Granger explained how limits to class size require additional staffing, and Director Credyt acknowledged understanding that additional non-resident students could end up costing the district more money than it would receive in revenue for those students. President Thomas commented on kindergarten class sizes and the need to add a teacher. Director Creydt asked about the change in funding for TTK. Ms. Porter and Dr. Granger explained that the funding received for those students can only be spent on the TTK program. Director Leu assured Ms. Porter than his "interrogative" manner was not meant to be negative, and he reiterated that his desire was to gain a better understanding about the correlation between enrollment and revenue. President Thomas expressed optimism, and discussion continued. Director Leu expressed appreciation for Ms. Porter's work.
  D. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of August. She explained adjustments and expenditures that will continue to be made as the 2022-2023 fiscal year is closed out which must be completed by October 25. Cash flow and expenditure comparisons were reviewed. Director Leu publicly acknowledged that the fund balance had trended last year just how Ms. Porter predicted it would in the spring. Ms. Porter indicated that she will report the final ending 2022-2023 fund balance at the October meeting.
  E. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
He thanked Amber Porter for her work which currently includes both closing out the prior fiscal year as well as preparing for the district's bond and levy initiatives.
A kindergarten section will need to be added at Blaine Primary School because enrollment has exceeded the BEA class size limit by 3 students. He explained that filling the position has been done internally and it has been delayed as assignments are determined for vacated positions. Once the shifts in staffing assignments are completed, students will be moved to their new classrooms.
Enrollment levels in grades 6-10 are low, and options for online instruction are being researched in an effort to recapture students in that grade range.
Supper with the Superintendent events in September were well attended in both Point Roberts and in Blaine.
Superintendent Advisory meetings will be getting underway in the coming weeks for parents, staff, and students.
If the board approves the proposed levy and bond resolutions at this meeting, Dr. Granger will inform staff of the PDC guidelines for election campaigning so they are aware of what is, and is not, allowable. Dr. Granger also encouraged the directors to become aware of the campaign guidelines for board members.
As of Friday, September 20, all volunteer applications submitted through September 1 have been processed. Dr. Granger shared information he learned about how other districts process volunteer applications. It had been assumed that Bellingham School District uses an automated process, however Dr. Granger learned that their volunteer applications are processed by a staff member whose position is funded by their education foundation.

Director Leu asked who he should direct questions to about the election, and Dr. Granger said to start with him.

  5. Action Items
A. 6000 Series Policy Manual Update: Second Reading and Adoption
Director Creydt asked questions about language adjustments in the following policies.
  Policy 6020 System of Funds and Accounts: Director Creydt questioned why language was stricken related to account custodian qualifications in the "Bank Accounts" section. Ms. Porter explained that the limited number of staff in the district's business office makes it impossible to assign a custodian who meets all of the qualifications. Ms. Porter further explained that the district does not currently use petty cash accounts which is what the stricken qualifications referenced in the current version of the policy. Extensive discussion followed regarding the district's ability to ensure independent review of bank accounts. Ms. Porter and Dr. Granger affirmed that the business office has checks and balances in place to ensure that accounts are maintained properly, and the board ultimately has the opportunity to review each expenditure through the summaries provided with the monthly Financial Matters agenda item.

Director Leu asked that these types of concerns be brought up ahead of the board's regular business meeting to ensure that each meeting participant can come better prepared for a discussion.
  Policy 6212 Charge Cards: Director Creydt asked why board approval was stricken for issuance of any credit cards or change in credit limit. Ms. Porter described how the district has managed the use of credit cards and how credit issuing companies change credit limits periodically. Director Leu suggested that board involvement in this area would be micromanagement, and he expressed trust in the people who have been hired to take care of this process. Dr. Granger provided additional explanation regarding the challenge of managing credit limits related to staff travel when credit limits have to be adjusted. Director Creydt indicated that she is not comfortable with anyone checking out a credit card for whatever they want whenever they want. President Thomas pointed out that the policy language directs the superintendent to establish procedures to manage that process, and more discussion followed. Ms. Porter stated that the procedure requires all credit card charges be backed up by an approved purchase order. Director Creydt expressed a desire for the board to play a role in oversight of credit card issuance, and Director Leu disagreed with the board having to provide review and approval to that level of detail. 
  Policy 6210 Purchasing - Authorization and Control: Director Creydt questioned the proposed language referencing a dollar threshold for small works procurement. Discussion followed regarding what is "small works procurement" and where its dollar threshold is found. Ms. Porter gave examples to provide clarity, and there was some confusion relating this to bidding requirements. Ms. Porter indicated that she would be able to provide the exact RCW with the small works procurement dollar threshold at the next meeting.
  Policy 6114 Gifts or Donations: Director Creydt asked why board approval was stricken for commitments made in return for a gift or donation. There was discussion regarding the importance of ensuring that the district is not unduly obligated to commitments made in return for gifts or donations. It was then noted that the same language, requiring board approval, is included later in a new section of the policy. Presumably, the language was stricken in the old section to avoid redundancy. 
  Director Creydt made a motion to approve "Second Reading" and adoption of updates to the
6000 series of the Blaine School District's Policy Manual, with the exception of policies 6020, 6114,
6210, and 6212 which will be considered at the October meeting.
Motion by Erika Creydt, second NONE.
  Director Leu recommended adding additional language to the motion with a provision that directors agree to bring questions for consideration before future meetings to avoid surprises.

At 8:47 p.m., President Thomas announced that the meeting would recess for 5 minutes to allow him a break to process the situation. The other meeting participants got up and moved about during the break.

The meeting resumed at 8:52 p.m. and President Thomas recommended new wording for the motion on this matter. Discussion followed, and Director Creydt indicated her agreement. The proposed motion was read aloud. When the vote was taken, Director Creydt's vote was not audible, and President Thomas asked for her vote. She indicated she would agree to the motion. President Thomas then declared the 4-0 vote.
  The board voted to approve "Second Reading" and adoption of updates to the 6000 series of the Blaine School District's Policy Manual, with the exception of policies 6020, 6114, 6210, and 6212 which will be considered at the October meeting, and with the understanding that future policy issues will be brought to the attention of each board member, through the superintendent, to allow each board member time to consider policy questions and concerns.
Motion by Charles E Gibson, second by Don Leu
Final Resolution: Motion Carries 4-0
Yea: Dougal Thomas, Erika Creydt, Charles E Gibson, Don Leu
  B. Resolution 2324-01 Replacement Educational Programs and Operations Levy
Amber Porter presented information about the proposed enrichment levy. She clarified that, under McCleary, the term "enrichment levy" has replaced what was previously known as a maintenance and operations levy. The change in name is intended to clarify the purpose of this levy, however Blaine School District still pays the same expenditures from levy funds, now with increased regulation. Ms. Porter explained why, under McCleary, the district has not been able to collect the full amount of levy funding approved by voters. Projected variables were reviewed, including anticipated rates per student and fluctuating enrollment. Ms. Porter explained the rationale for projecting high enrollment in levy planning. The projected rate per $1000 is dependent on enrollment, and Ms. Porter pointed out the county average of $1.58/$1000.

Dr. Granger addressed topics that have come up in the community. Despite the term "enrichment levy", these funds are not used for unnecessary extra expenses. The levy provides critical funding to support valuable student programming. It is important that the community understands that the levy funding is not extra money. A simple majority of votes is needed for the levy to pass, and the term "replacement" is used to indicate that it is a continuation of the current levy. Collection on the proposed levy would begin in January 2025. Director Leu asked how the levy would be worded on the ballot, and Ms. Porter indicated it would read, "Replacement Educational Programs and Operations Levy".
  The board voted unanimously to adopt Resolution 2324-01 Replacement Educational Programs and Operations Levy. President Thomas declared the 4-0 vote.
Motion by Dougal Thomas, second by Don Leu
Final Resolution: Motion Carries 4-0
Yea: Dougal Thomas, Erika Creydt, Charles E Gibson, Don Leu
  C. Resolution 2324-02 General Obligation Bonds
Dr. Granger clarified that the Performing Arts Center would not be replaced but will be upgraded. A timeline was provided starting with when funds would become available, followed by a design phase, and then when work could begin. Allowing adequate time for the design phase is critical in order to maximize the ability for construction to be done properly. The first project will be long-overdue upgrades to the athletic facility at Pipeline. Electrical and mechanical upgrades are planned further out and could end up absorbing expenditure reductions if necessary. Ms. Porter explained the rationale for a final bond amount of $70M which is higher than what was estimated at the board's August meeting. She further explained the potential for state funding assistance and informed the board that any assistance from the state would likely be only a small percentage of the overall project's cost. Ms. Porter explained the financing structure that has intentionally been planned to maintain the current tax rate, accounting for bonds that are rolling off. Tax rate projections were also reviewed and discussed.

Dr. Granger expressed his appreciation for the work done by Ms. Porter, as well as by the Facility Committee. If approved, work will begin right away to provide information to the community, as well as to plan for what will take place following a successful initiative.

Director Leu asked about upgrades planned at Point Roberts Primary School and discussion followed. Dr. Granger thanked Ms. Hettinga for her feedback on what would benefit Point Roberts Primary School students.
  The board voted unanimously to adopt Resolution 2324-02 which authorizes submittal of a $70,000,000 Bond Initiative to voters for the February 13, 2024 Special Election. President Thomas declared the 4-0 vote.
Motion by Don Leu, second by Charles E Gibson
Final Resolution: Motion Carries 4-0
Yea: Dougal Thomas, Erika Creydt, Charles E Gibson, Don Leu
  6. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)
A. General Comments
President Thomas commented on the importance of communicating to voters, based upon past experience, that the district's ability to complete all of the projects intended for the bond funding will depend upon factors outside of the district's control, and there are no guarantees that every project can be completed. Director Gibson expressed appreciation for efforts to maintain the current tax rate. Ms. Porter reiterated that increases in property assessed value would still result in increased taxes, and that is outside of the school district's control.

Director Leu commented on the importance of providing feedback on WSSDA's Legislative Priorities which will be sent out soon. He asked for that topic to be included for discussion at the next board meeting.
