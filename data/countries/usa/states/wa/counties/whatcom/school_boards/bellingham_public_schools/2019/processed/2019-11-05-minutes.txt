DISCUSSION
Bellingham High School students shared about their work to create a fun and inclusive
school-centered trademark for t-shirts and signs around the school: “We ___ BHS.” The
middle “verb” in their brand can be anything that a student (or staff) has pride in and
identifies with: cheer, soccer, chemistry, basketball, math, QSA, etc., or it can simply be
their mascot the red raider hawk. Bellingham High School staff talked about the inclusive
culture of the school.
