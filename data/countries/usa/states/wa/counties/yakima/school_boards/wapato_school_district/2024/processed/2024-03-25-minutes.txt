Robotics and Engineering Club: Chris Beyrouty, Advisor and Robotics and Engineering students presented the details of the travel request recommendation such as the club must place in top 5 at Districts competition to be invited to the World Competition in Houston, TX. The Board reviewed the budget worksheet presented and discussed the details and cost of the travel request. The Board voiced its concerns about the number of chaperones presented, the number of vehicles need to transport students, and the overall cost of the trip. The club does not have funding secured at this time and may not have enough chaperones to assure the student to chaperone ratio needed. Mr. Beyrouty commented the club has a plan in place to raise the needed funds, and the number of students attending and the number of vehicles needed has decreased. The consensus of the Board is to approve the travel request contingent on the team must qualify at the upcoming Districts competition, revise the request to include an accurate list of chaperones, revise the budget worksheet to reflect actual and all costs of the entire trip including transportation needs, and the club must secure the funding needed prior to travel to this event.
Action: 6.09 Travel Request - WHS Robotics & Engineering Club to George R. Brown Convention Center, April 16-21, 2024 Houston, TX. Approval of the travel request contingent on the team must qualify at the upcoming Districts competition, revise the request to include an accurate list of chaperones, revise the budget worksheet to reflect actual and all costs of the entire trip including transportation needs, and the club must secure the funding needed prior to travel to this event.

Facilities Update: Javier Rodriguez, Maintenance Director reported the plan to begin work in preparation for arrival/installation of the pump at Camas/Satus once it cleared by the engineers. The work will take place over spring break while school is not in session. The concern is the main water supply will need to be shut off to complete the installation to replace the non-working pump. The installation will take about 5 days and the water will be shut off during that the installation and this will be an issue if students are in school during the install.
Kevin Hill, Executive Director presented an update of the 2024 Capital Projects list. He reported receiving a more accurate costs for items on the list that has increased the estimated cost by $173,000. He informed, most of the funding will be applied the Well at WHS project and the district may need to come forward with a budget extension to Capital Projects. Sylvia Bazan, explained at this time a budget extension is not needed because the capital projects fund has as accounted for a set a side amount that may be applied and there are still projects on the list that remain as quotes and estimates. If when those costs increase that is when a budget extension may be needed.
