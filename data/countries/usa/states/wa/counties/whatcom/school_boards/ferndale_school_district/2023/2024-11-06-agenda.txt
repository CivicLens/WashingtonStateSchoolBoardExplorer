Director Melinda Cool will recite this land acknowledgment:

We, the Ferndale School District, acknowledge we are residing on the traditional, ancestral and unceded
territory of the Lummi People.
The Lummi People are the original inhabitants of Washington's northernmost coast and southern British
Columbia. They lived in villages throughout this territory and continue to have an ongoing relationship
with these areas.
Since Time Immemorial, they have celebrated life on their water ways and on the traditional, ancestral,
and unceded lands of their People to perpetuate their way of life.

We honor their ancestors as we acknowledge the past, present and future Lummi People as the original
inhabitants of this land.
