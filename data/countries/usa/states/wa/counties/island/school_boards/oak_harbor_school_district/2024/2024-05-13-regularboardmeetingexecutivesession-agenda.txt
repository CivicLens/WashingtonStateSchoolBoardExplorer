Public Content
Oak Harbor Public Schools recruits teachers with academic majors in the subjects they teach. However, changes by the Office of
Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) and the Professional Educator Standards Board (PESB) have increased the
complexity of certification compliance. The factors that have increased our number of teachers requiring Board approval to teach
out of their endorsement area are as follows:

Co-teaching model with special education paired with general education teachers
Alignment with State Course Codes
Complex state endorsement requirements
OHI Math/Science and English Language Arts/Social Studies assignments

Regardless of these requirements, the teachers on this list are proficient in the subject areas assigned as determined via annual
evaluations.

Exceptions to classroom teaching assignments are allowed as stipulated in WAC 180-82-110, Exceptions to Classroom Teacher
Assignment Policy, and, additionally for Special Education, in WAC 392-172-202, Rules for the Provision of Special Education. In
order to assign teachers in subjects other than their endorsed areas, the district must determine that the teachers have the
competencies to be effective in subjects other than their endorsed areas. Such teaching assignments are approved by this
formal approval of the local school board.
