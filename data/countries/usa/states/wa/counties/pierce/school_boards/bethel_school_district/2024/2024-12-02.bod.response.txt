Frequently Asked Questions I want to speak to the Board but cannot make it to a School Board Meeting The Board understands the need to hear the voices of the community we serve. We also understand that not everyone is able to come to the regularly scheduled School Board meetings. With that in mind, this school year we will be hosting additional community forums at different locations, where two Board Directors will attend to better hear your concerns, thoughts and ideas to help our district continue to grow and serve our community even better in the future. The next Community Forum will be January 23, 2024 at 6:30 p.m. at the Parkland/Spanaway Library . As always, you can also find contact information for each School Board Director below. Director Boundaries Every ten years after the census is completed, school districts in Washington state must adjust director districts. School board members are elected at large but must live in a specific director district that is equal in population. The legal descriptions for the newly aligned director districts can be found below: There shall be one director from each of five director districts as established by the Regional Committee on School District Organization. One director shall reside in each of the respective director districts. All directors shall be elected by voters in the entire school district. A map showing director district boundaries shall be developed and made available to candidates for the board and other citizens. The director districts are described as follows: Full Director Boundary Map Director District 1 Director District 2 Director District 3 Director District 4 Director District 5 Director District 1 Director District 1 | View map Starting at the intersection of eastern school district boundary and 176th St E.
