Re: Long-Range Strategic Facilities Planning and Sustainability Framework - Final Report
__________________________________________________________________

The Long-Range Strategic Facilities Planning and Sustainability Action Planning Committees are composed of district staff,
certificated staff, students, architects, consultants, and community representatives. Throughout the 2023/2024 school year, the
committees have been working toestablish a framework to inform future decisions regarding school district facility inventory,
organization, and design. As of June 5, 2024, both committees have completed their work in providing the district with a LongRange Facilities Plan and Sustainability Framework to guide facility replacement, modernization, and maintenance over the next
ten to fifteen years with a focus on fiscal and environmental sustainability.
I will present the final Long-Range Facilities Plan and Sustainability Framework Report and request approval of the plan and
board authorization for district staff to proceed with bond and levy planning to address the findings and conclusions of the report.

RE: BSF (Bainbridge Schools Foundation) Donation
___________________________________________________
The Bainbridge Island School District received a generous donation from the Bainbridge Schools Foundation for $500,000.
This BSF donation supports the BISD in 3 key areas: Academic Intervention, Social & Emotional Learning, and Educator Support.
BSF funds supportacademic interventionthat is critically necessary to support ALL students,but not funded at the state or
federal level. At any point along the K-12 educational pathway in the Bainbridge Island School District, a student may need extra
academic support. Funding from BSF allows educators to provide intervention that is flexible, data-informed, and studentcentered, to ensure we are meeting all students where they are at, with appropriate support, at the time it is needed.
BSF funds support the adoption and implementation ofSocial and Emotional Learningcurriculum that is required of all public
school systems by Washington State Law, but not directly funded at the state or federal level. The curriculum adoption and
implementation process includes time for review of curriculum, funds to support professional learning, and the purchase of
instructional materials. Once initially implemented, it is critical that educators align practices, articulate lessons and units, and
receive followup training and support to ensure curriculum fidelity across classes, grade levels, and schools.
BSF provideseducator supportin several key areas. The financial support provided by BSF allow us to expand impact of the
application-based annual state grant (BEST funds) to ensure all novice and new-to-district educators receive consistent and
specific support from an experienced educator (Educator Support Specialist), a mentor teacher, and professional learning
opportunities throughout the school year. Additionally, BSF funds allow building principals to fund professional development for
whole-staff, teaching teams, or individual teachers throughout the school year, based on school improvement plan goals and
current initiatives. This flexibility in funding has been critical to move forward the work of the BISD District Improvement Plan.

Irequest the approvalof this impactful and generous donation.

RE: 2024-2025 Fee Schedule
______________________________________________________________
I am submitting for your approval the fee schedule for the 2024-2025 school year. Please note that after five years of
progressively removing or reducing fees for families, this fee schedule illustrates a significant shift with the reinstatement of fees
for lab courses with consumable materials. Additionally, this fee schedule notes slight increases for some courses and all exams,
due the cost of materials, supplies, and proctor payment as relevant. Please see notes that follow the fee schedule.
The costs of materials, supplies, and proctors have been previously covered by the Teaching & Learning Department budget, but
in an attempt to increase revenue and decrease expenditures, we believe that re-introducing some fees is reasonable.
In order to ensure all students can access all offered courses and exams, we utilize applicablefeewaivers and scholarships.
Additionally, students/families may request financial assistanceto coverfeesthroughthe YES fund.
The YES fund is made possible by generous donations to the Bainbridge Community Foundation, with 100% of funds allocated
to our district going to directly serve student academic and extracurricularneeds.

Re:Seal of Biliteracy

_______________________________________________________________
The Washington State Seal of Biliteracy recognizes public high school graduates who have attained a high level of proficiencyin
one or more languagesin additionto English. I will present to Superintendent Thomspon and the Board of Directors the names of
graduates in the Class of 2024 who earned the Seal of Biliteracy while attending Bainbridge High School. This is a new process
for recognition of this accomplishment in BISD, identified by the Spanish Immersion SteeringCommittee as a key element to
build knowledge and advocacy for our district Dual Language Program El Velero.
The Washington State Dual Language Program Guide is linked here for yourreference:https://ospi.k12.wa.us/sites/default/files/

The Washington State Seal of Biliteracy(RCW 28A.300.575,WAC 392-410-350) was established in 2014 with the intent to
recognize public high school graduates who have attained an intermediate-mid proficiency in English and one or more world
languages, including American Sign Language and Tribal languages. Students in all Graduation Pathways are eligible to earn
the Seal.- SOURCE:https://ospi.k12.wa.us/student-success/resources-subject-area/world-languages/washington-state-sealbiliteracy

Re: Preliminary 2024-2025 Budget
____________________________________________________________________________
As a class 1 district, Bainbridge Island must adopt an operating budget for the subsequent fiscal year by August 31. This
preliminary budget offering will continue to be refined according to need and Board direction up until the point of adoption.
Enrollment totals assume a decrease in traditional enrollment, primarily in kindergarten. The Districts Alternative Learning
Programs are seeing growth, particularly in the home school partnership.
Staffing comprises 86% of the expenditure budget.
Utility budgets reflect a 5% assumed rate increase. WSRMP notified the District earlier in the year that insurance premiums will
see a 15 % increase over the 2023-2024 fiscal year.
Pursuant to RCW 28A.320.330(2)(f)(ii), ongoing technology levy costs have been budgeted in the General Fund with an
associated transfer from the Capital Projects Fund. These would be renewal of online subscriptions and digital services. This
marks a shift in previous practice and accounts for the noticeable increase in purchased services for the technology department.
(ii) Costs associated with the application and modernization of technology systems for operations and instruction
including, but not limited to, the ongoing fees for online applications, subscriptions, or software licenses, including upgrades and
incidental services, and ongoing training related to the installation and integration of these products and services. However, to
the extent the funds are used for the purpose under this subsection (2)(f)(ii), the school district shall transfer to the district's
general fund the portion of the capital projects fund used for this purpose.
Ending fund balance is projected to be 3.55% with the the margin between the projection and the designated 5% balance at
$977,000.

The Water leak in the COS pit parking lot has been repaired. Special thanks to Alias Tate and Logan Fenwick for the
repair work and great attitudes. The leak turned out to be caused by a metal pipe fitting that had corroded. The section
was replaced and simplified with the removal of a dead end section of pipe left behind from the old COS water main.

Technology Levy Budget Summary
This is a summary of the 2023/2024 technology levy budget. This summary provides information on the total encumbrances
(outstanding and paid) applied to the 2023/2024 fiscal school year. The 2023/2024 technology levy budget is supported by
collections from 2021 BISD technology levies.
SY 2023/2024Technology Levy Budget Capacity
Encumbered To Date (Commitment to Pay when Invoiced)
Variance (Est. Remaining Encumbered Budget Capacity)

$ 2,866,770.00

$ 568,941.05

In this months Technology Levy report, I would like to bring to the Boards attention that the impact of moving the Technical
Support Salaries to the Technology Levy is now visible in the accompanying Budget Summary document.
As detailed in my Board presentation in May, we have taken several steps to reduce the 2023-24 Technology Levy expenses in
an attempt to offset the unplanned payroll expenses. While our total remaining capacity is currently positive at $236,132, we
estimate that by the end of August, our total Tech Levy expenses will exceed the original budget by approximately $60,000.
While this is somewhat disappointing, we do not anticipate any major problems as the Tech Levy cash reserves are healthy at
$2.75 million and considering that the increased $4 Million funding from the 2023 Tech Levy is slated to begin in 2025.
Outside of budgeting, the Technology Support staff are busy with maintaining and preparing technology across the district, the
Student Records team are transitioning to the next school year, and the Network team has begun the work of programming and
installing the first batch of new network switches. Im also pleased to report that the launch of the new website is essentially
complete with the exception of select user training in August and some remaining performance issues.

b. Summary of Revenues and Expenditures
c. Budget Status Reports for All Funds

Commentary:
Revenues:
As expected with the over projection of enrollment, YTD revenues continue to trend slightly under projections at
$50,341,022.
YTD revenues are 3.4% higher than the same period last year, reflecting the annual increases applied to
apportionment.
Revenues for June were $3,782,656, a decrease of $6,728 compared to June 2023.
Expenditures:
YTD expenditures are slightly under budget projections at $54,580,261 due to the movement of salaries to the capital
projects and tech levies.
Expenditures for June were $5,704,500, an increase of .1% over the previous year.
Fund Balance:
As of June 30, 2024, the ending fund balance in the General Fund was $1,249,731.47 thanks to the timing of the generous
$500,000 donation from Bainbridge Schools Foundation.
