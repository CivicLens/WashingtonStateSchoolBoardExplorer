RE: WIAA Classification
___________________________________________
The WIAA completes school classification every 4 years. The averages of grades 9-11 are reviewed over the course of an eight
month period approximately. Bainbridge High School was previously in the 3A classification based on grades 9-11 having over
900 students. The averages from the most recent cycle were under 900 students leading to Bainbridge moving from the 3A
classification to the 2A classification. The 2A classificationrange has 450-899 students in grades 9-11. Bainbridge will also
remain in the Olympic League which is a 2A classification league. The current classification cycle will go from 2024 thru 2028.
Schools have the ability to appeal their classification 2 years into the 4 year cycle.

Re:School Consolidation Advisory Committee (SCAC) Update
___________________________________________________
BISD is incredibly fortunate to be part of a talented and engaged community that is willing to analyze the various school closure
/consolidation plans, ask questions and provide input on the proposed scenarios.
After reviewing the thoughtful applications from interested staff, parents and students and reviewing the considerable amount of
material needed to be covered in a short amount of time, it was determined that rather than having a small number of people
work on such a large undertaking, BISD would be better served by creating a robust committee with seven subcommittees as
follows:
Scheduling

Facilities/Logistics
Budget Implications
Equity & Inclusion
Social Emotional Care and Transitions
Teaching & Learning Implications
Long-Term Planning and Enrollment Projections
The first SCAC meeting was held on Wednesday and more than 100 committee members were present. Committee members
were provided with an overview of the goals of the SCAC:
To have a shared understanding of the overall district capacity in the areas of budget, enrollment (projections) and
facilities
To have a shared understanding of student demographics and needs in order to ensure that students are at the center
of discussions
To rebuild trust by facilitating a transparent process to understand the unique needs of our school communities, the
students who they serve and the best way to preserve the heart of what they hold dear in light of closure/consolidation
realities
To share SCACs findings with the school board to help the board make an informed decision in March
After reviewing the committee's charge, the group broke into assigned subcommittees and evaluated one of the proposed
scenarios by reviewing its potential strengths and challenges/barriers using the lens of the subcommittee's topic. The analysis
from this weeks meeting will be shared at the January 25th School Board meeting and the website

Re: Capital Projects, Facilities and Operations Report - January 2024
______________________________________________________________________
Small Works Capital Projects
DA Hogan and Associates are refining multiple design concepts of the Central Campus Athletic Complex for Capital
Committee review during the 2023/2024 school year.
Skyline Communications has completed the installation of all hardware and cabling for the second phase of security
upgrades. Capital staff are working with project managers from Skyline to complete punch list items through the first
week of January.

NW Cascade has completed the installation of the new Sewer Lift Station at the transportation facility. Punch list items
have been addressed during a recent walkthrough of the project and the sewer lift station is fully operational. Capital staff
will continue to work with staff from the COBI Public Works Department to obtain an updated industrial waste discharge
permit for the connection to the citys sanitary sewer line.
The Long-Range Strategic Facilities Planning Committee and Sustainable Action Planning Committee have postponed
meetings for January in response to recently scheduled committee work regarding school closure and consolidation.
Capital staff will work with the Mithun Design team to extend the meeting schedule for each committee into May and June.
NW Lift and Equipment has submitted the necessary paperwork to start the contract writing process for the replacement
of the heavy-duty vehicle lift system at the transportation shop facility. A draft contract is being revised in preparation for
legal review.
Capital staff are working with architects and building administrators at Woodward Middle School to refine designs for the
Woodward Restroom Remodel Project. Administrators are providing input related to traffic flow and privacy within a single
occupancy restroom design structure similar to that of the BHS 100 building.
Following school board direction provided at the regularly scheduled school board meeting on December 14th, Capital
staff are reaching out to multiple vendors and engineers to schedule meetings and site walks at school facilities outlined
in the written analysis of possible school closures and consolidations.
Transportation
WSP Spring inspection of the whole fleet, inclusive of motor pool vehicles is scheduled for May 8th & 9th
One driver in training is preparing to test for their CDL and is tentatively scheduled to test in late January. The
department is in the process of hiring another driver candidate pending a successful background check.
Transportation is expecting the delivery of a new 78-passenger bus in mid to late February. The original order for the bus
was placed on October 24th, 2023.
Operations
Facilities calendars are now open to the community for scheduling and reservations for the spring quarter.
Multiple plumbing failures due to abnormally low temperatures have been identified at the Sakai, Woodward, and
Transportation buildings. Restorative repairs and remediation efforts are ongoing but the buildings are safe and continue
to serve their primary purposes. Maintenance and Custodial staff will work to ensure preventative measures are put in
place to avoid similar issues in the future.

Re: Monthly Report on Technology Levy, Planning and Projects

Technology Levy Budget Summary
This is a summary of the 2023/2024 technology levy budget. This summary provides information on the total encumbrances
(outstanding and paid) applied to the 2023/2024 fiscal school year. The 2023/2024 technology levy budget is supported by
collections from 2021 BISD technology levies.
SY 2023/2024Technology Levy Budget Capacity

Variance (Est. Remaining Encumbered Budget Capacity)

$ 2,866,770.00

Overall operational technology status in the district remains healthy. Since the last Technology Monthly Report in late November
2023, there have been no major technology financial expenditures outside of monthly payroll, with the exception of a second
order of replacement UPS batteries for $9,350.69 in December.
We are currently reviewing multiple vendor responses to our December RFP for replacing our aging building network switches. I
will be bringing more information about this project to the Board, including a vendor recommendation, to the meeting on 2/8/24.

2. Budget Status Reports for All Funds
Commentary:
We continue to closely monitor revenues and expenses. Currently, we expect fund balance to end the year within Board policy
and close to budget.
Revenues:
Revenues are generally in line with both budget and prior year trends.
Revenues for November were $3,729,315. For December they were $4,697,438.
Federal revenues reflect the claims for federal funds for September-November that we were not able to claim
earlier in the year.
Expenditures:
General Fund expenditures for November were $5,376,973. For December they were $5,092,198.
Purchased services are higher than last year, driven by the timing of payments for firewall and internet security solution
payments.
Cash Flow:
As of December 31st, 2023, the closing cash balance in the General Fund was $3,040,802. At this point we are forecasting
having enough cash flow to get through low cash flow months.
