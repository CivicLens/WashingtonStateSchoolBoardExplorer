Discussion: 2.02 B/SR 3 Authority of the Superintendent
Dr. Dominguez is seeking clarification of how best to communicate with the Board. Ms.
Uppiano shared her perspective of the approval process of interlocal contracts by the board. Dr.
Dominguez reiterated needing clarity in communication. The board can be at a disadvantage with
communication because every decision must be made in public. It can be difficult to function as
a team without collaboration. Giving authority to the Superintendent to do the work by having
very clear policies is the most efficient method.
Recommendation was made to revisit the reports and indicators and make sure they are
reasonable and meaningful.
