Subject :

A. Public Comment Guidelines - We welcome and appreciate
hearing from our citizens regarding issues of personal or
public interest. The board requires those who wish to speak
(but not all attendees) to sign in so that the board has a tally of
individuals who wish to speak and can call them forward.
When called forward, individuals will identify themselves ans
proceed to make comments, limited to 3 minutes per person,
time may not be deferred during the public meeting and should
be presented respectfully. The board is not obligated to
respond to questions or challenges made during the public
comment period and the board's silence will not signal
agreement or endorsement of the speaker's remarks. The
board may control the time, place, and manner of public
comment. The chair may terminate an individual's statement
when the allotted time has passed and may interrupt a
speaker to require the same standard of civilty that the board
imposes on itself.
