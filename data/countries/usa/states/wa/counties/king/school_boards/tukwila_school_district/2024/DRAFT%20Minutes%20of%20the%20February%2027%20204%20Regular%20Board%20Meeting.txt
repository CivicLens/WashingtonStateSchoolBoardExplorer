4. Public Comment
A. Public Comment
President Hoover called for public comments.
President Hoover read the following Public Comment:
Tim Renz Teacher - Foster High School - This is in regard to the District's decision to end the subsidy for the Champions Before
and After School program effective March 15, 2024. I will be posting a petition at each of the Elementary schools by the end of
this week to collect signatures from other families that agree with the statement on the petition, which will follow these remarks
that should provide context. Due to the late notification of this decision, families were told on Friday, February 23, 2024, and the
current board meeting schedule, the signatures could not be collected before a regularly scheduled board meeting. The negative
impact of the District's decision will be felt by families starting March 18, which is a week before the next board meeting on
March 26, 2024. It is unclear if the timing of this decision was a deliberate attempt to prevent the public from addressing the
Board about this issue. Apparently, originally the District had proposed to end the subsidy on March 1 with the same notification
timeline. The statement on the petitions is as follows:
The Champions Before and After School program currently serves about 150 elementary school families in the Tukwila School
District. Before and After school programs are essential to closing the achievement and opportunity gap. These programs are key
partners for schools and families, providing underserved students with meaningful academic and enrichment activities, keeping
kids safely off the streets during the prime time for juvenile crime, and offering necessary child care for working parents. The
families, who are served by the Champions program, registered for an entire school year of subsidized services. To abruptly end
the subsidies for the Champions program is placing unnecessary financial strain and emotional stress on these families. To expect
families to come up with up to $700 per month for one child or alternative before and/or after-school services is an unreasonable
burden and is not fair to the families.. We, the undersigned individuals, support the Champions programs and urge the Tukwila
School District to continue funding the Champions programs and to develop a plan to keep these high-quality programs
subsidized in the future. End petition statement.
On a side note, as a long-time employee of this district, this is my 34th year, I started at Thorndyke in 1990 and have been at
Foster since 1997, I have made the conscious decision to have 2 of my 3 children attend Tukwila Schools, even though I don't

live in the district. I had to argue with the district in 1999 to let my out-of-district son attend Cascade View at a time when outof-district students weren't allowed to enroll. My daughter is currently a 2nd grader at Tukwila Elementary School. Not only am I
bringing another FTE into the district, I am publicly stating to the community that I believe in the Tukwila School District and
fully believe that this is the place that is the best place for my child to attend school. However, due to the starting and ending
times of the High School and the Elementary Schools, without the services provided by Champions, I would NOT be able to have
my daughter attend schools in Tukwila. The District needs to develop a plan to accommodate staff who want their children to
attend Tukwila Schools. I know that there are other staff who are in the same situation and others who would bring their children
here if there was a convenient way to make it work. The 10% Employee Discount for Champions services, once the subsidy is
removed, is NOT an incentive for me to continue to have my daughter attend schools here. I don't have an extra $700 per month
to pay for continued Champions services when I built my budget based on the fact that when we registered for Champions in
September, we were registering for the entire year at the subsidized rate. It seems like we entered into a contract between us,
Champions, and the Tukwila School District that the District is now attempting to change the terms of that contract. Please, for
myself and the 150 families that are being impacted by this decision, reconsider.
5. Reports
A. Student Representatives Report
Jr. Representative Brewster reported on attending the Gates Education Roundtable, along with Dr. Pedroza and Sr. Representative
Nguyen. The discussion focused on post-secondary success which refers to what it takes to sufficiently prepare students for
transition from the K-12 system to many career paths out there. We also highlighted the pros and cons of CTE classes. Sr.
Representative Brewster and I also agreed to interview students for the Superintendent Advisory Committee. The first goal of the
committee is to write an anti-racist statement, vision and mission.
B. Superintendent Report
First, I want to thank our students, families, business partners, staff, union leadership, and our citizen’s committee for their vote
on February 13th that passed both of our levies with over 64% passage rates. The efforts of the citizen’s committee and the
volunteers who took their time to put out signs, ring doorbells, and share information were amazing. Thank you! Thank you for
your confidence in the Tukwila School District. I also want to highlight this week is Public Education Week. Thank you to all of
the public school educators in Tukwila who serve our students every day!
Building Closure Update: I am happy to report that Cascade View students and staff are mostly in their spaces. Our
administration building is being worked on and we expect to be out of the building until April.
Health Update: Good news! COVID numbers have significantly decreased since last month. There is a reduction in adult COVID
cases from last month. During the last few weeks, the nurses have noticed an uptick in stomach-related illness but not at a rate
that warrants notification to Public Health, we are monitoring the situation. Additionally, EpiPen’s are being shipped to us so we
have our supply ready.
I want to personally thank Director Proctor for his connection to his daughter in support of us getting vaccinations for our
students. On February 24th, they saw 31 patients and administered 69 vaccinations from Seattle Children’s Odessa Brown
Clinic.
Other events:
Student Advisory applications: We are set to begin our meetings in March after review of the applications.
It’s a privilege to serve in an ex officio capacity on the Tukwila Children’s Foundation, an endeavor dedicated to
addressing the unmet needs of our community’s children. At our most recent meeting, discussions centered on several
grant proposals, each targeted toward literacy and broadening access to the arts. At our next meeting in March, we
intend to discuss fundraising ideas.
Gates Education Roundtable: As our student directors reported – I just want to add that I learn so much from both
Dennis and Alex in these spaces. It is such an honor to be there with them.
Still Water Story: Since 2016, Still Waters Services has been a beacon of hope for families in transition, ensuring every
child is nourished and ready to learn. Initiatives like the Tukwila Weekend Snack Pack Program provide essential
sustenance, fostering belonging and empowerment. With dedicated volunteers and community partnerships, Still Waters
continues to make a profound difference, uplifting students' voices and creating a brighter future for all.
Foster Cheer Team participation in State Cheerleading Competition (February): Foster High School's Cheer Team
showcased their distinctive "Stomp & Shake" style at the recent State Competition. While they didn't secure a placement,
their energetic co-ed routine garnered praise for its creativity and impact.
Foster HS Student qualified for the Washington Music Educators Association All-State Performances (February): A talented
student from Foster High School earned a spot in the prestigious Washington Music Educators Association All-State
Performances, showcasing their exceptional musical prowess and dedication to the craft. Also celebrating Director of
Bands, Cody Maynor, whose unwavering dedication to our students has played a significant role in our students' musical
success.
CTE Open House: The winter CTE open house was a resounding success, offering a glimpse into the exciting opportunities
awaiting students. From hands-on demonstrations to engaging presentations, attendees explored diverse career
pathways. Stay tuned for our upcoming spring open house, promising even more insights and inspiration for students'
futures.
C. Board of Directors Report
Director Simpson reported that he is continuing to work on renewing our partnership with Highline College and getting them back
into Foster High School and working with our students on free FAFSA training, and other free services.

Director Hoover reported the Race and Equity training was rescheduled for this month. This was a full day of learning, reflecting,
and thinking about what the steps are and moving toward what we believe as far as anti-racist practices in our district.
Director Proctor reported that is was a busy month. He is glad to hear the vaccination clinic was a success. He reported on
working with a group in Seattle that may be willing to do some mentor programs in our district.
Director Larson shared on AI and its use in teaching in schools. We need diverse people to help with this, otherwise, it will not
be effective. He reported on attending the girls' basketball game. They were close to winning the playoffs in preparation for the
state finals. Congratulations to our girls' team! Sporting events need better advertising so people know when the events are and
can come and support our students. Director Larson commented that our scoreboards are missing some lights, which look
tacky. Hopefully, we can get the lights replaced. He reported on attending NCCE, which is the National Council on Computers
and Education, in Seattle. Theren Hayes presented on Read / Write which is a great tool for MLL students. He also attended a
session on assistive communication with our Speech-language pathologist. He reported on attending a meeting at North Kitsap
School District. They had a really interesting way of incorporating the MTSS framework for how we support the whole student,
not just the academics, but also social/emotional. They developed an interesting dashboard that incorporates how the students
are doing in their academics, attendance, behavior, and social/emotional measures. If interested in looking at the dashboard,
please email Director Larson. He reported on attending the Tukwila City Council Meeting and thanked the council for passing a
resolution to support our levy. He shared that there is a new Interim City Manager, Marty Wine. Director Larson met with the
Environment Science club at FHS. The students mentioned that they are interested in getting solar panels. Director Larson
advised to conduct research and then present it to the Board.
D. Legislative Update
Director Larson shared several updates. The legislative session is coming to a close, which means a lot of bills have died for this
session. Director Larson shared that there wasn't going to be a lot of new money coming to school districts this year because
this is what they call the supplemental year. The session was more preparate to try to prepare for next year when they'll be
doing the full two-year budget. We may receive a little additional funding for Special Education as discussions continue on raising
the cap to 17.25%. There is a slight addition of money for MSOC, which would help with covering insurance costs which are
continually rising. It also looks as though there may be a little more allocation for Para-Educators. House Bill 1368 would require
electric buses and infrastructure for school districts. Hopefully, our district will be able to get grant money to help with
infrastructure costs, etc. Senate Bill 5462 for inclusive learning standards and instructional materials is super controversial as
it's about including LGBTQ history in learning standards and instructional materials. This is a big battle between the conservative
parts of Washington. Last year, this bill got almost to the end The bill is being discussed again during this short session. a

7. Board Discussion
8. Questions Only - Presentations
A. ELL and Dual Language
Director Hoover commented on Page 2 of the report. They asked if there was any data on other intersecting identities in
connection with the impact on student longevity within the program, i.e. gender, class, socioeconomic status, etc. Dr. Deno
shared that we do not have that data at this time, but will follow up with data as requested.
Dr. Pedroza shared that this should be a more focused discussion at a future work session. We will take this information back to
the assessment team for a deep dive into data.

Director Larson would like the World Language report included as part of this report in the future and he would like to see what
technology are we using to assist in communications.
B. i-Ready - Second Diagnostic
There will be a more in-depth discussion at the March 12th Board Work Session.
Director Larson asked why none of the Tukwila Elementary students showed growth in reading. Mr. Baker shared this data is on
students who are two plus grades behind. The number is less than 10.
C. Enrollment Report - February 2024
D. Monthly Budget Status Report – January 2024
Director Larson shared that he still does not understand why we didn't get transportation safety net funding. Amy Fleming, CFO
shared that we didn't get transportation safety net funding because we couldn't demonstrate that excess need. We will look at
this again next year.
9. Presentations
A. Race and Equity Lead Committee Presentation
Race and Equity Leads shared the Race and Equity Lead Committee presentation with the Board. Highlights included:
Summary of Work - History of Race and Equity in the District - the most important thing is getting building leads. Before
this, it was two (2) staff volunteers. This has made the work for community centered.
Progress in Key Topics - Race and Equity teams written into the CBA, along with compensation for members, Race and
Equity Summit in August, clear anti-racist vision with intended consequences for the entire district., and District level
Race and Equity Lead team members are well established with continued work done at site and across District.
Threats/Challenges - burnout/high turnover in Administration, lack of accountability for carrying out district expectations,
lack of required professional development, District budget situation, and District anti-racism policy needs to be updated.
Opportunities - required professional development on anti-racism, new Board members bring new ideas and perspectives,
District policy requires district-wide racial equity plan with clear accountability and metrics (implemented through
strategic plan), and equity plan includes restorative practices and equity audits.
Indicators of Success - actionable goals related to racial equity are included in each school's SIP, typically predictive data
(discipline data) will not be racially predictive, and BIPOC staff and students will indicate a sense of safety and belonging
based on multiple measures in proportion to white staff and students.
Tools for measuring Success - SWIS data, climate surveys, skyward data, school progress towards SIP goals, race and
equity plans, and equity audits.
Next Steps - Follow up on discussions between Equity Leads and School Leaders, identify specific actions to be taken by
RELT, determine times/dates when RELT representatives can facilitate professional development, Race and Equity updates
at monthly staff meetings, and Building Leadership Teams to include race and equity members.
Director Larson asked if the policy would be updated. Dr. Pedroza shared that the policy would be updated by the Race and
Equity Leads Team.
Director Proctor shared he wants to hear more about the lack of accountability and suggested making race and equity training a
required training for all staff, onboarding, and policy changes.
B. 23-24 Forecasted Revenue and Expenditures
Amy Fleming, CFO, shared the 23-24 Forecasted Revenue and Expenditures presentation with the Board.
Director Larson shared that he was curious as to how the district got into this situation. It sounds as though we have an internal
control problem. Who is responsible for overseeing the budget? Amy Fleming shared that because she is new to the district she
doesn't have the history or what the process was at the time the 22-23 budget was developed. Moving forward we have
instituted additional internal controls, and as we are looking and analyzing budgets for next year, we are making sure that costs
are reflected accurately and that we are actually getting to a zero or higher fund balance.
Discussion ensued regarding the Champions after-school program ending in March. The 21st Century Grant is not funded for the
next school year, so we are looking at alternative before and after-school programs. Champions is working with families and
offering scholarships through federal grant monies, offering full and partial subsidies, and reduced tuition with a reduced co-pay
amount.
Director Simpson shared that after-school programs are essential for families and students. We need to really look at other
programs and get creative in our budget. Dr. Pedroza shared that if the Board would like to move forward with funding the
Champions after-school program, then we will need to make budget cuts in other areas. Director Proctor shared that we may
not be able to provide funding, but we could provide other resources such as space for a program. We need to look at other
programs and work collaboratively and creatively in providing this service to our students and families. Director Larson shared
that in last year's state budget, Representative Bergquist added $148,000 to Tukwila School District for after-school programs
and it is his understanding that we have not yet been able to find where that funding is. CFO Fleming shared that she has been

researching this and has not been able to find a $148,000 allocation or state grant. Director Larson will share additional
information with CFO Fleming. Dr. Pedroza shared that we are looking for grants to help supplement families. Director Simpson
shared that he wanted to make sure that we are supporting our families. Scott Whitbeck, Chief Academic Officer, shared that he
would be available at all three schools to speak with families and help them fill out applications if needed.
CFO Fleming continued the financial presentation sharing the next steps which include meeting with staff to review current
budgets, analyzing all grants, reviewing current gender fund costs that may be eligible to be charged to the tech levy, and
continuing with the internal controls. Additional next steps may include a hiring freeze through the end of the year. and
analyzing and potentially ending some vendor contracts before the end of this fiscal year. As part of the OSPI and ESD budget
oversight, CFO Fleming is required to re-do the 2023-24 budget with OSPI and ESD and submit it to the Board of Directors for
re-approval. The planned completion is scheduled for March 2024.
As part of the 2024-25 budget development, and as required by binding conditions, we must provide a balanced budget that
brings our fund balance to $0 with further work to begin building fund balance reserves. Additionally, ESSER funding ends
August 31, 224 totaling $5.9 million in lost funding. This is important as we do have some staff positions and some contracts on
ESSER funding. Therefore our estimated 23-24 Fund Balance is projected between negative $3.5 to negative $4.3 million.
CRO Fleming shared information on how the district will get to a $0 fund balance. Staff attrition will not get us there alone. This
means there will be cuts on certificated staff, classified staff, central office staff, and contracts. This is the only way we can get to
a $0 fund balance and begin rebuilding reserves. These will drive recommended cuts:

D. Approval of School Resource Officer (SRO) Agreement
Director Proctor made a motion to approve the School Resource Officer (SRO) Agreement.
Director Simpson seconded the motion.
The motion died on the floor.
Director Larson asked what is the plan to introduce the SRO to the student body? How are you ensuring that students have a
solid understanding that this is an additional resource being implemented to complement and enhance the other safety resources
that are already in place? Principal Christopher shared that staff and students shared several different strategies including
introducing the SRO program during 6th grade orientation. We would have SROs there so that students and parents would be
introduced to them, who they are, what their function is, etc. Due to limited availability right now with the department, the team
tried to identify different events where we could be highlighting those staff who were coming on board so that they would be
seen with the community.
Principal Parker shared that one of the things we want to be extremely intentional about is who is in the building. We want to
have a SRO who is there, and who is actually building and bridging relationships with our scholars. It is important for us to
introduce it to our community through our current programs and groups that we have, and having our potential SRO come and
connect with families. We want to, as a school community, restore and help bridge some of the historical harm that has
happened by connecting with our youth.
Jr. Student Rep Brewster shared that it would be good to connect with the Superintendent Advisory Group and have student
input on the pre-selected SROs that have already been trained. This would definitely help ease the SROs into our schools.
Amendments:

Article 2, Section B, Number 2 - Replace "with the ability to request the assistance and input of the District" with "in
collaboration with and input from the District".

11. Public Comment
A. Public Comment
President Hoover called for Public Comments.
Kate Krueller - Community Member - I have two (2) comments. I see nothing in the language that was just passed and can
change in the future, so for your consideration, because I do this for a living, is adding body-worn cameras on officers for the
sheriff's department. There is no language in there saying whether they can or cannot use that and you might want to consider
that and have it defined as to what the school district cares about. Additionally, I would love, either at the next meeting or if
you know today, to understand the process for applicants for District 2.
Chief Drever shared that policy mandates the wearing of the cameras for a uniform. This would not be uniform, however, we can
find a way to make sure that the cameras are on the officers. They don't record 24/7, they only record when activated. There
are certain policies that would dictate when they have to activate them and we can work through that to make sure that we are
incorporating it and providing that added level of accountability.
