Eliel Galicia Student Board Representative Student Member - Johanaly Torres Student Board Representative Student Member - Lucina Valenzuela Student Board Representative President - Rita Keene Position 4 Term Expires 2027 rkeene@qsd.wednet.edu My name is Rita Keene. I have been a member of this community for over 50 years, attended all12 years in QSD, and raised 4 daughters who also attended school here. My decision to run as a member of our school board is simple. I am concerned with the direction the State of Washington is headed regarding school policies for the education of our children, therefore I see a need to change policies. I want to find positive solutions that will respect and restore our parent's rights in education and uphold their moral values and desires for their children. I want to see OPT-OUT forms provided for Comprehensive Sex education, surveys, and any counseling or treatments that our schools deem necessary without informing parents FIRST, aside from extreme physical emergencies, whereas they will be contacted at the earliest possibility. Bring up state standards in reading and math, therefore assessing current curriculum. Make our schools safe and see transparency to the public when dangerous issues arise. Regain community values. Adopt town hall meetings or a Facebook page to hear community concerns.
