Feb 5, 2024 - Board Meeting - 7:00 p.m.

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Adopt Resolution 2363 declaring an emergency and
waive the statutory requirements related to competitive
bidding.

Public Content
SITUATION
In mid-January 2024, Einstein, Wilder, Dickinson, and Twain Elementary Schools, along with Inglewood Middle and Eastlake and
Juanita High Schools sustained damage when pipes froze and caused flooding. The damage displaced some students, teachers
and staff at these schools at the time of the incident and continues to do so today.
These circumstances were beyond the control of the District. They presented a real and immediate threat to the performance of
essential functions of the District and were likely to result in material loss or damage to property if immediate action was not
taken.
RCW 28A.335.190 and RCW 39.04.280 allow a school district to waive competitive bidding requirements in the event of an
emergency. Waiving the competitive bidding requirements allows the Facilities Department to secure contractors to repair
damages in a timely manner. The attached resolution is included for board action.
RECOMMENDATION
The Board of Directors adopts Resolution 2363 declaring an emergency and waives the statutory requirements related to
competitive bidding.
