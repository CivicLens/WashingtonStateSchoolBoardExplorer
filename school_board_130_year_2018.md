## 2018-04-18 - BELLINGHAM_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS (Agenda)

The Bellingham School Board scheduled a special meeting and public hearing on April 18, 2018, to discuss amending Resolution 14-13. This resolution, originally adopted on June 27, 2013, outlined eligible capital improvement projects funded by the 2013 bond issue. The proposed amendment aims to allow bond proceeds to be used for starting work on projects identified in the 2018 bond measure.  

The public hearing will gather feedback both for and against the amendment. Following the hearing, the school board will consider approving the proposed change at their regular meeting immediately afterward. The amendment is being recommended to enable the initiation of projects approved by local voters under the 2018 bond measure, with bonds from the 2018 authorization expected to be issued later in the year. This action aligns with RCW 28A.530.020, which mandates a public hearing prior to amending the list of eligible projects associated with a bond issue.
