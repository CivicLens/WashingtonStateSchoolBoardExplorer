9. Work Session
Superintendent VanderYacht presented a Capital Facilities timeline to provide a background to
the work that has been done by the Bond Planning Task Force (BPTF) which led up to their
presentation tonight. He thanked the group for the thoughtful work that is culminating with
tonight’s presentation.

Ashley McClaran with OAC Services then presented the board with a summary of the work that
was done by the BPTF and what steps they took to come to their recommendation. Topics of
their meetings included reviewing existing conditions & finances, district programs & cost
analysis, conducting school tours, reviewing possibilities & planning, and building a consensus &
recommendation. The group also used a list of guiding principles which helped in their decisionmaking process and prioritization. The groups discussed space & design capacity, enrollment vs.
capacity, facility condition concerns, welcoming & safe learning environments, and safety &
security concerns- especially at Lynden High School since it is an open campus. They then
discussed options for solutions to each of these concerns which included the use of the School
Construction Assistance Program (SCAP). The group also analyzed tax impacts.
The group identified $187 million worth of needs. From there, they discussed priorities with the
goal of maximizing costs. The group agreed that $160 million was the preference for a bond
amount, which includes the SCAP funding taken into account.
Replacement vs. renovation of LHS was discussed. Replacement was the choice to resolve safety
concerns, lower maintenance costs, and to bypass the added costs of portables necessary to
house students during a remodel. There is also the cost of delaying new construction, as a new
high school will be needed eventually. Lynden High School pricing estimate is $150,000,000 for
replacement. That estimate is based on a professional third-party estimate done in May of 2023
and a comparison on Ferndale’s new high school based on square footage, and then averaging
the two estimates.
There was also discussion held regarding the upcoming expiration of the operation levy at the
same time and how that may impact the passing of a bond.
Members of the Bond Planning Task Force that were in attendance then provided input on their
recommendation and provided anecdotes, thoughts, and feedback on how their discussions
concluded with this recommendation.
The group reiterated the need for community education regarding levies and bonds and making
sure there is no misinformation being circulated throughout the community.
The Board thanked the Bond Planning Task Force for their thorough report.
There was no action taken at this meeting. Following this presentation, the board will be
engaging with the broader community to move towards a decision regarding a potential funding
resolution. Superintendent VanderYacht briefly explained the next steps in this process.
