  B. Teaching and Learning Report - Shelly Whitten
Deputy Superintendent Whitten asked Executive Director of School Improvement David Kennedy to update the board on the Washington School Improvement Framework Cycle 3:
Connections to the district's Strategic Plan and School Improvement Plans
Upcoming SIP review in December will now include the WSIF tier identification level 
WSIF launched in 2017 as a replacement/improvement for "Every Student Succeeds Act" of 2015, which was a replacement/improvement for "No Child Left Behind Act" of 2002
Shift from punitive accountability to support-based model of accountability proves more successful in changing student outcomes 
Defined what the Levels of Support systems means and how the district provides supports for those tiers
The multi-indicator approach of WSIF tells a more complete picture of school improvement than previous accountability measures like NCLB
Example data for PHS used to illustrate the state threshold concept using state assessment data 
BGPS improved between Cycle 2 (2022) and Cycle 3 (2023) - Less schools needing supports (from 12 to 7) and more schools achieving the Foundational Tier (from 32% to 58%)
