AGENDA ITEM:
Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Meadow Ridge Elementary Boiler Replacement
Added Project to 2018 Capital Levy
AGENDA ITEM:
The boiler at Meadow Ridge Elementary recently stopped working due to a failed internal heat
exchanger. The maintenance team, through the practice of saving useable parts from prior replacement,
had this operational part, and was able to get it installed. The system is currently functioning and is close
to its date for being replaced. Boiler systems are critical to building operations for heat and code
compliance. The Capital Projects Team, in collaboration with the Facilities Team, is requesting to add this
project to the 2018 Construction Levy.
The project scope includes:

Design to replace existing boiler with two KN boilers.
Replacement of boiler and circulation pumps.
New electrical, water lines, gas lines, and exhaust as needed for installation.
New controls tied into existing school control system.
A budget of $ 400,000 is based on an engineers estimate included in their fee proposal to design,
complete the construction administration and verify the system for proper operation.
BOARD GOAL: Building Equitable Systems & School Environments
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
$400,000 is requested from the current 2018 Capital Levy Fund Balance.

AGENDA ITEM:
On March 29, 2023, the Kent School Board approved Resolution No. 1639 - 2016 Bond Fund
Reallocation, which allowed the district to proceed with strategic property purchases in support of
essential student programs. The resolution identified seven current 2016 Bond projects budgets to be
reallocated. The total dollar amount that was approved to be relocated was $ 5,601,763.00.
On July 6, 2023, we closed on the first property located at 11027 SE Kent Kangley Rd for a total of
$1,382,250.54. We closed on November 1, 2023, on the second property located at 11109 SE Kent
Kangley Rd for a total of $1,731,699.52. These two new properties total $3,113,950.06.

The district has determined there are no other strategic properties available currently to support program
expansion. $2,487,812.94 was not used from the approved resolution and will remain in the 2016 Bond
current cash balance.

Managed Internal Broadband Services Request for Proposal (RFP)
AGENDA ITEM:
The Kent School District network now supports well over 60,000 network connected devices (desktops,
laptops, phones, printers, intercom system devices, etc.) With this many devices now relying on the
network, the district needs to think of the network as a critical system that needs to be monitored
24x7x365 and responded to immediately when there is a service impacting outage. While the district
currently monitors the network, the district does not have staff actively watching for alerts outside of
normal business hours currently. Fortunately, the federal government also recognizes that school district
networks are critical infrastructure and has provided funding through the ERATE program for Managed
Internal Broadband Services (MIBS). These services can be used for things like:
Daily off-site network configuration backup and retention
Critical vulnerability patching and upgrades
24/7 Device monitoring and alerting
Priority training of new products and features for our KSD Network employees.
An RFP has been issued for MIBS with the intent to have ERATE pay for 80% of eligible services that the
district chooses to utilize.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 1: Preparing Students to be Global Citizens
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
There is currently money set aside in the budget for these services with an estimated 80% of the funds
being paid for directly from ERATE.
RECOMMENDATION:
N/A - Informational only.
