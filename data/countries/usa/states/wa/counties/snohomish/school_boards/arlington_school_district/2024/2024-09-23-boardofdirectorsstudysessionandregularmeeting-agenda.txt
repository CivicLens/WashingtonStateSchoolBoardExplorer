9. REGULAR MEETING - Consent Agenda
Subject :

A. Budget and Enrollment Reports

Meeting :

Sep 23, 2024 - Board of Directors Study Session and
Regular Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the September enrollment
as presented.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services

Background Information:
August Budget Report:
August 2024's budget report is not yet available. The District's fiscal year is from September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2024. The Financial
Services Department is busy preparing the required financial accruals and year-end close processes. Accordingly, the months of August,
September, and October are not finalized until financial year-end proceduresare complete. A final for the month of August 2024 will be
presented later in November, along with a final for the 2023-24 fiscal year as a whole.

September Enrollment Report:
September 2024 enrollment is 5,452.48FTE (Full-Time-Equivalent), which is 16.48FTE more than 2024-25 budgeted enrollment of 5,436
students. September's count is compiled uniquely from other months in that it is a four-day count of students who are enrolled and who
actually attend school on at least one of the four count days in September. If a student attends school on any one of the four count days,
they can be counted for September (unless they are withdrawn).In future months, the data counted for the purposes of enrollment funding, is
based on student enrollment as of the count date which is the first school day of the month and is not necessarily based on whether they are
in attendance on that very day. New students continue to enroll, and we anticipate the October enrollment to show additional growth.

Although the numbers are in a state of fluctuation during the first few weeks of school, the Superintendent's Cabinet met on a daily basis
during the first week of school to carefully analyze preliminary student counts by school and grade band, compared to budgeted enrollment.
This is an important function which allows the district to consider adjustments to staffing or other changes if needed and if feasibly possible.

Previous Board Action:
Board acceptance of Budget Reports for July 2024 occurred at the September 9, 2024, regular Board Meeting.

In 2024-25, the AAA members will receive the inflationary increase set by the legislature of 3.7%. However, the AAA understands the
District's current budgetary constraints and the agreement includes four furlough days as well as a pause in professional development funds
for the 2024-25 year.In 2025-26, salaries will be increased by the inflationary factor set by the legislature plus .5%. In 2026-27, salaries will
be increased by the inflationary factor set by the legislature plus 1.5%.

Contract with Snohomish County Human Services as

Goals :

Public Content
Submitted by:
Karl Olson, Director of Categorical Programs
Background Information:
Arlington Public Schools contracts with the Human Services Department of Snohomish County to fund the Early Childhood Education and
Assistance Program (ECEAP) Preschool Program. ECEAP partners with families to prepare their children for success in kindergarten. The
program provides free preschool to families who meet the financial requirements.
Administrative Considerations:
Research demonstrates the importance of early education. Due to financial constraints, many families are not able to provide a preschool
experience for their children. ECEAP works to strengthen the entire family and provides a positive opportunity, not only for pre-kindergarten
students, but for their families as well. Finally, the contract that is attached does not contain any significant differences from the 2023-24
contract.
Budgetary Impact:
Arlington's ECEAP Preschool budget for the 2024-25 school year is $647,680.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the 2024-25 Balfour-Taylor
Yearbooks Agreement for Arlington High School as
presented.

Goals :

Goal 1: Student Learning & Achievement

Public Content
Submitted by:
Marilee Herman, Arlington High School Principal; and
Anne Hayman, Arlington High School Yearbook Advisor
Background Information:

Every five years, Arlington High School seeks competitive bids from yearbook publishers for the
publication of their yearbook. The bids are scored and ranked based on price, curriculum, technology and
references. Based on this criteria, Balfour-Taylor Yearbooks was the successful bid. Arlington High
School has used Balfour-Taylor to publish their yearbooks since the 2000-2001 school year and they
have provided great customer service, technology that is important to the yearbook program and quality
printing at a reasonable price.
Administrative Considerations:

This is a one-year agreement with the option of an additional four years. This type of agreement gives
Arlington High School the option to request bids at a later date, if they have any issues with the publisher.
Budgetary Impact:

The total estimated price of Arlington High School's yearbook for 2024-25 is $50,688.00. This cost will be
offset by yearbook sales revenue.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:

Arlington High School is seeking approval at the September 23 meeting, to allow for processing of the
first deposit on the yearbook which is due December 15, 2024.

9. REGULAR MEETING - Consent Agenda
Subject :

H. Transitional Bilingual Instructional Program (TBIP)
for the 2024-25 School Year

Meeting :

Sep 23, 2024 - Board of Directors Study Session and
Regular Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the 2024-25 Transitional
Bilingual Instructional Program.

Goals :

Goal 1: Student Learning & Achievement
Goal 2: Safe and Caring Environment

Public Content
Submitted by:
Karl Olson, Director of Categorical Programs
Background Information:
Board Policy 2110 requires that the Board annually approves the District's Transitional Bilingual Instructional Program (TBIP). The
accompanying procedure states that, "Annually and prior to the Board's program approval, the Superintendent or designee will report on the
status of TBIP."
Administrative Considerations:

The District's TBIP addresses the English language acquisition needs of eligible students and supports to
access grade level content. The program pays for 1.45 FTE certificated staff and 2.8 FTE classified staff
with possible increases in staffing as funds allow.
TBIP provides support to students in kindergarten through twelfth grades. Services are designed based
on the needs of students and includes push in, pull out, English Learner (EL) newcomer classes,
instructional co-teaching, and instructional coaching. Currently, there are approximately 306qualified
students along with 52 students who are new to our district or in kindergarten who are yet to be screened.
We also have approximately 33exited students that we still monitor for up to 2 years.
Budgetary Impact:

The initial EGMS funding for the Transitional Bilingual Instructional Program for 2024-25 is $637,211.
This was based on a "rolling average" from the April 2024apportionment. The apportionment will most
likely increase due to more qualifying students in our program than were counted during that previous
apportionment.

Goals :

Goal 2: Safe and Caring Environment

Public Content
Submitted by:
Kerri Helgeson, Director of Equity and Student Well-Being
Background Information:
Over the past several years, mental health services were provided to Arlington School District students who would not have received them
otherwise. Mental health counselors work continuously with 6-7students each day at all of our schoolsand engagedin several mental health
triage situations. Mental health support has been an increasing need across the District and is identified as a priority for Arlington students.
These are the same contracted mental health services as in previousyears, and would becontracted by PHD#3 to provide services.
Administrative Considerations:
The district will provide space for each mental health counselor in their respective buildings to meet with students, staff, and families, in
exchange for services at no cost to the families. PHD#3 has a separate agreement with each mental health counselor to reimburse them for
services that cannot be billed, or the difference between insurance reimbursement and cost for service.
Budgetary Impact:

There will be no fiscal impact to the district by engaging in this cooperative agreement.

Board approval is time sensitive in that it will provide a written document outlining the rights and
responsibilities of both landlord and tenant that was not previously in existence.
