Recommended Action :

By motion, adopt the attached resolution authorizing
execution of a Supplemental Agreement No. 1 to the
Professional Services Agreement with Welch Comer
Engineers for the Downtown Pullman Project Phase 3
Construction Phase Services.

Public Content
At their February 13th, 2024 meeting, the City Council approved Resolution No. R-1224 authorized the execution of a Professional Services Agreement with the consulting
firm Welch Comer Engineers for construction services for the Downtown Pullman
Project.That agreement authorized work to be performed on a cost-reimbursable
basis with a not-to-exceed budget of $1,050,000.
Throughout the project's construction phase, the Consultant performed work
necessary for the project that was outside of the original scope of work. In addition,
due to changes encountered during construction, the duration of the construction
contract was lengthened. This required the Consultant to extend their performance
period beyond the original timeframe estimated back in February. Therefore, the
existing contract needs an amendment to cover these additional services provided by
the Consultant on the Downtown Pullman Project.
As a result, the attached "Supplemental Agreement No. 1" is proposed for Council
consideration. Exhibit A of this proposed supplemental agreement provides
information related to the additional services provided beyond the original scope of
work. "Supplemental Agreement No. 1" proposes to add $204,000 to the agreement,
which results in a revised not-to-exceed budget of $1,354,000.
Funding for this supplemental agreement will come from the current compilation of
funds used on the Downtown Pullman Project, including ARPA, utility, stormwater,
Transportation Improvement Board, and Whitman County .09 funds. Pending Council
approval on this resolution, a budget amendment for the Downtown Pullman Project
will be presented at the December 17th City Council to account for this Supplemental
Agreement.

120 Civic Improvement Funds

Recommended Action :

City staff recommends adopting the attached
resolution as presented.

Public Content
On February 15, 2022, the Pullman City Council amended Pullman City Code
Chapter 4.95 to the Civic Improvement Fund, specifically creating expenditure limits
on theannual average revenue deposited in the fund for thefollowing activities:
4.95.030(3) - Discretionary Lodging Tax Grant Program:25%
4.95.030(4) - Funding of Annual Festivals and Events: 50%
4.95.030(5) - Contracts for Tourism Promotion or Tourism Facility Operations:
25%
On February 28, 2023, the Pullman City Council approved a Tourism Promotion and
Event Management Agreement for 2023-2025 with the Pullman Chamber of
Commerce (Chamber). The Chamber was the only respondent to the Request for
Proposals for this contract work.
Based on the signed agreement, city staff created a budget for the 120 Civic
Improvement Fund - which has already been adopted by the City Council as
previously presented.
The three-year average revenue deposited in the 120 Civic Improvement Fund is
$742,490. The 2024 projected collection for this fund is $737,584.
The anticipated expenditures for tourism promotion or tourism facility operations have
recently exceeded the codified threshold of 25% - which would be $185,622, and are
expected to end the year closer to $320,000. The 2024 budget for this line item is
$402,523.
To maintain concurrence with the Pullman City Code, city staff is recommending the
City Council adopt the attached resolution to set aside the 25% maximum
expenditure threshold rule for the 2024 calendar year as it relates to tourism
promotion agency services or tourism facility operations.

Recommended Action :

Approve Resolution adopting a fee schedule for the storm
drainage and surface water management utility chapter of
the public services and utilities code pursuant to the
provisions of chapter 10.30 of the Pullman City Code.

Public Content
In theirSeptember 27, 2022 meeting, the City Council increased the stormwater utility
rates by approving ResolutionR-62-22.At that time, it was anticipated that the 4.5%
increase authorized was an inflationary stopgap. Inflationary-based increases were
recommended to take place annually until a full cost-of-service analysis (COSA)
could be completed. A COSA is still planned, now budgeted for 2025 after the
Comprehensive Stormwater System Plan is completed and approved by Council.The
Comprehensive Stormwater System Plan will inform the COSA, and the COSA will
guide stormwater utility rate setting.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI-W) increased 6.3% between 2022 and the most
recent figure for 2024. Staff recommends increasing the stormwater utility rates
unilaterally by 6% to help offset the rising costs of providing stormwater utility
services. Staff also recommends adjusting the appeal fee to $250.00 to account for
actual costs in administering a stormwater appeal.
Staff issued notices of the proposed utility rate increase in the Moscow-Pullman Daily
News on November 14, 2024, and November 23, 2024, to inform the public of the
increase.

that approval has not yet occurred. A COSA is still planned, now budgeted for 2025

Public Content
In theirSeptember 27, 2022 meeting, the City Council increased the sewer utility rates
by approving ResolutionR-61-22. At that time, it was anticipated that the 4.5%
increase authorized was an inflationary stopgap. Inflationary-based increases were
recommended to take place annually until a full cost-of-service analysis (COSA)
could be completed. A COSA is still planned and is now budgeted for 2025 after the
Sewer System Plan is completed and approved by the Council.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI-W) increased 6.3% between 2022 and the most
recent figure for 2024. Staff recommends increasing the sewer utility rates unilaterally
by 6% to help offset the rising costs of providing sewer utility services.
Staff issued notices of the proposed utility rate increase in the Moscow-Pullman Daily
News on November 14, 2024, and November 23, 2024, to inform the public of the
increase.
