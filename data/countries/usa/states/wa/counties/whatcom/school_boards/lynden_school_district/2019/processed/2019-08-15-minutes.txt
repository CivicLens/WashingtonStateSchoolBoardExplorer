2. Good News




LHS is excited to share some data from our AP Calculus exam results:
Jordan Vanderveen taught AP Calc BC, which includes AP Calc AB plus another quarter of college
calculus. Nationwide, there were only 2,648 students that took the AP Calc BC exam. LHS had 17 of our
18 students take this exam! This is an AMAZING participation rate both in terms of how many students in
the class felt confident enough to pay to take the exam, and the proportion LHS represents in the national
participation. When students take the Calc BC exam, they also [automatically] get a Calc AB sub-score,
which can also be used to get college credit for calculus 1 (BC gets you Calc 1 and 2).Now for our data: 13
of our 17 testers scored 3 or higher! 16 of our 17 testers scored a 3 or higher on the Calc AB sub-test! The
one student who didn't take the BC test, took the AB test and he earned a 3. Essentially that means 17 of
18 students enrolled in AP Calculus earned college credit through a highly rigorous,
independently administered, one-shot high stakes exam. Jordan has repeated this performance each year
he has taught AP Calculus. This is quite the "feather in the cap" of Jordan, LHS, and Lynden School
District.
The success of our LHS AP English students under the instruction of Mariah Butenschoen: 30 of 43
(70%) students in the AP English class took the exam. This is a strong participation rate. 22 of 30 (73%)
scored 3 or better on the AP Exam. The state average was 62% and the global average was 54%. This is
a rigorous, high-stakes exam and this sort of performance is quite the "feather in the cap" of these
students, Mariah, LHS, and the Lynden District!
Also impressive from the AP Government Class: 28 of 31 students took the AP Gov test. Participation at
this rate is very special. 22 of 31 (79%) scored 3 or better. The State average was 63% and the global
average was 55%.
