Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Vendor

Meeting :

Mar 20, 2024 - Regular Meeting

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order contract to US Foods, Inc., Spokane, WA, in the annual estimated approximate amount of
$5,800,000.00 for food products and supplies to be purchased during the 2024-2025 fiscal year.
Background:

This recommended contract provides food products and supplies in support of the meal programs. The prime vendor system has
allowed the nutrition services and warehouse teams to more effectively manage food and preparation/serving supplies,
purchases, and distribution. By awarding a single prime vendor, the district receives just-in-time product, has the benefit of a
more flexible procurement model with a wider variety of offerings, and a shorter lead time for specialty items. The district
receives specialized customer service by building a partnership with the prime vendor rather than from a distributor who makes a
single drop ship delivery in the more traditional procurement approach. As an additional advantage, product quality is at a higher
level of freshness given the quick turn-around of goods.
The Prime Vendor Request for Proposal was sent to the local food distribution vendors in the Spokane area along with being
posted and advertised on a nationwide public solicitation website. However, when the solicitation was due, the district received
notification by Sysco Spokane and McDonalds Distribution out of Eugene, OR, that neither contractor would be participating in
our Request for Proposal. McDonalds determined that until they are able to establish a warehouse in the Spokane area, they
could not provide the level of service our district needs. Sysco notified the district that they are currently unable to meet the RFP
requirement to stock and provide pricing on 95% of the top 75% of items most commonly ordered by our district. Since this would
cause their proposal to be non-responsive, they opted to not submit.

US Foods, Inc. was the only vendor to submit a proposal and is recommended for award. This firm, after purchasing Food
Service of America during the 2020-2021 fiscal year, has effectively served the district as the prime vendor. The term of this
solicitation is August 1, 2024, through August 31, 2025, with four additional one-year renewal options available thereafter in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the RFP. Prices are considered fair and reasonable. The expenditures will be paid
from the general fund.

Recommendation:
It is recommended that the purchase order contract issued to HopSkipDrive, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, for Supplemental Student
Transportation be increased by the estimated amount of $110,000.00 for the remainder of the 2023-2024 fiscal year.
Background:
This renewal purchase order contract was approved by the School Board last summer to provide supplemental student
transportation services. The district provides transportation for approximately 10,000 students. The majority of these students are
traditional riders with bus times well within the state regulated time limits. Often, with the need for McKinney-Vento/Foster
(homeless) approved students who may live as far out as Blanchard, Idaho or Davenport, Washington, these limitations tend to
get extended, causing ride times of up to two hours or more on a school bus. There have also been instances where the bus
contractor may refuse to transport a student with special needs who has been physically violent and/or injurious towards the bus
staff. Since it is a legal requirement to transport students with special needs, if the parent/guardian cannot transport, having
accessibility to an alternate option is necessary. Many of the students being serviced by this provider are special needs and
McKinney-Vento eligible.
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the RFP, pricing was to have remained firm for any subsequent renewals.
However, due to the volatility in gasoline prices, general inflation affecting all areas of the economy and higher costs in securing
new drivers, pricing needed to be adjusted to allow the contractor to operate in todays market. As such, the district and operator
came to a mutually agreed upon pricing structure. Last September, when this purchase order was initially created, the dollar
amount estimated for the year was based on historical figures. We are now in the position of having to increase the purchase
order value by $110,000.00 for the remainder of the 2023-2024 school year. This adjustment is needed to support the agreed
upon raise of 22.8% for the base rate per ride this year. We have also had to utilize this service more than originally anticipated
last fall. As such, it is deemed to be in the best interests of the district to make this price increase. The expenditure will be paid
from the general fund.
