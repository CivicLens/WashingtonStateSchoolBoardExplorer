The Selah School District No. 119 Board of Directors held a meeting on October 10, 2024, where the main agenda item was an appeal hearing regarding the reconsideration of library books. Daylene Ackerman addressed the board, advocating for the removal of certain books based on her concerns about their content, which she argued was inappropriate and aligned with Marxist ideals. The Instructional Materials Committee (IMC) had previously reviewed six books and decided to retain them, a decision that can only be reconsidered in three years, as per Procedure 2021. The board, led by President Dan Peters, affirmed that the IMC followed the correct criteria in their decision-making process.

During the meeting, discussions highlighted the importance of parental involvement and community engagement in the review of educational materials. Derek Iverson expressed a desire for increased parental participation in the IMC, emphasizing the need for diverse community opinions. The board's decision to uphold the IMC's recommendation reflects ongoing tensions between parental rights and book access in school libraries, as well as the challenges of balancing community standards with educational content.
