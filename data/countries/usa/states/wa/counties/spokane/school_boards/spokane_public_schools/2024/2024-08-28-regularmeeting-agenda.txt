Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation:
Renewal of purchase order contract to Pizza Pipeline, Spokane, WA, to supply pizza for the lunch program at district high schools in the
anticipated estimated amount of $600,000.00.
Tabulation:
Pizza Pricing:
Cheese Pizza $11.20
Pepperoni Pizza $11.20
Canadian Bacon & Pineapple Pizza $12.25
Sausage Pizza $11.20
Vegetarian Pizza (4 vegetable toppings) $14.35
Background:
This recommended award will provide hot pizza delivered to the district high schools as part of the lunch offerings available through the
Nutrition Services meal program. This RFP has been evaluated on a pre-determined set of criteria published in the solicitation terms and
conditions. These components included price (50%), pizza quality (35%), service (10%) and invoicing processes (5%). The district has used
Pizza Pipeline previously with their product being well received by students and given the requested price increase of 4.5% per pizza (due to
increased minimum wage for labor, fuel costs and inflated ingredient costs) was considered fair and reasonable, the decision to renew award
of this contract was deemed appropriate. This company has proven to be an excellent business partner. The term of this contract shall be
from September 1, 2024 through August 31, 2025. This renewal accesses the second of four one-year optional renewal contracts per the
terms and conditions of the RFP. This expenditure will be paid from the general fund.
