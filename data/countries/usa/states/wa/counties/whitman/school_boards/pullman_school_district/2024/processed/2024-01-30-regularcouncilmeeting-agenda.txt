The Pullman City Council held a Retreat on February 5, 2022, and Goal Setting Work
SessionsonMarch 22, 2022, and April 19, 2022. The Final 2022-2023 Goals &
Priorities document was adopted by the City Council on May 3, 2022.
As part of this adopted document, City Council has requested quarterly updates as to
the progress of these goals and priorities. This has occurred regularly via memos
from the City Administrator to the Mayor and City Council. In lieu of a quarterly memo
update, the City Council requested updates in 2023Q1 and 2024Q1 to be in person
as part of an agenda item during a City Council Meeting.
In addition, the City Council would like to resume the goal-setting cycle to occur
directly before the 2025-2026 biennial budget process. As such, the next goal-setting
process will resume after this 2024Q1 City Council Agenda presentation.

Public Content
Ordinance 10-23 directs that 50% of retail sales tax revenue collected each quarter (less sales
tax derived from construction activities) in excess of $594,135 be placed in the Restricted CIP
Reserve Fund to be used for capital improvement projects.
Ordinance 12-10 further requires the Finance Director to submit a Quarterly Report of the Citys
retail sales tax revenue collections and financial condition. This provides the City Council an
opportunity to revise the percentage placed into the Restricted CIP Revenue Fund.
The 2023Q4 report attached indicates that the transfer amount by ordinance would be $403,443.
For comparison, the 2022Q4 period amount was $397,000. The year-over-year increase of
$6,443 is the result of increased overall sales tax revenue.

On July 12, 2022 the Pullman City Council approved Ordinance 22-18 creating a new
chapter inCity Code,1.58"Salary Commission for Elected Officials" which supersedes
previous language inChapter 1.40.
In preparing to recruit the 2024 Salary Commission, staff discovered that Chapter
1.40 was not repealed as it should have been when approving Ordinance 22-18.
To correct this oversight and provide additional clarity, staff has created the attached
ordinance. No additional changes are recommended to Chapter 1.58 at this time.

On February 20, 1979, the Pullman City Council adopted Resolution R-18-79, which
provided for the election of the Mayor Pro Tempore commensurate with RCW to
occur annually at the first Regular City Council Meeting in February or at any time
that the office becomes vacant.
After reviewing previous activities, staff recommends the City Council consider
repealing this resolution and replacing it for two reasons:
to createa formal acknowledgment of the Alternate Mayor Pro Tempore position,
and
to increase timeliness and efficiency inappointing these positions to coincide
with the City Council's annual assignment of responsibilities toboards,
commissions, and committees.

Staff recommends further City Council discussion and

Public Content
At the January 9, 2024 City Council Meeting, the City Administrator presented a
discussion item regarding the agenda framework for Regular City Council Meetings.
After the City Council discussion, guidance was provided to the City Administrator to
return with a resolution outlining the preferred agenda order for a final discussion and
possible adoption at the next Regular City Council Meeting - which falls on January
30, 2024.

After additional staff research, Resolution R-12-13 was identified as the guiding
document for how the current regular agenda is structured. Staff discussed this
existing resolution and learned that it has been amended in the past with Resolution
R-22-21 as an example for when City Hall moved from the old location at 325 SE
Paradise Street to the new location at 190 SE Crestview Street. As such, staff has
created Resolution No. R-07-24for City Council consideration based on the previous
instructions provided and past practices.
In addition, staff recommends adopting the subject headers as presented only. The
expectation is to provide thorough descriptions in the agenda item under the headers
as assembled in BoardDocs to create a more complete understanding of what each
header item entails. By adopting the header items only, it allows for flexibility in future
editing of such clarifying language when further explanation may be required, or
changes become necessary due to state laws being enacted - while not requiring
staff to return to the City Council with additional resolutions for these types of simple
language modifications.
