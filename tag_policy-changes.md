## 2015-07-16 - BELLINGHAM_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS (Agenda)

The Bellingham School Board scheduled a special meeting and public hearing on July 16, 2015, to discuss amending Resolution 14-13.

The proposed amendment aims to add the acquisition or construction of a new warehouse and portable classrooms to the list of eligible projects.

The need for a new warehouse arose because SCAP funds, initially anticipated for its construction, would not be available in time before demolition of the existing warehouse to make way for the new Options High School in June 2016. The amendment would allow bond proceeds to fund the immediate acquisition or construction of a new warehouse.
