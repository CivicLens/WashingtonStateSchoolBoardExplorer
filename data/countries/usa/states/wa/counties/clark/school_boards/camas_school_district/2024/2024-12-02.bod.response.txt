Legislative actions have created school boards to serve as state agents to administer the school functions, which have been delegated to local districts. School board members are responsible to the voters and act under state law restrictions. The board provides direction for the district, approving policies, making financial decisions, determining building needs, and approving the budget. The progress of the district is reviewed regularly by the board. The board relies on the superintendent for advice, but final decisions are the school board s responsibility.
