ABSENCE OF A BOARD MEMBER

Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice, as soon as possible, to the president or
superintendent of their inability to attend a board meeting. Board directors will participate in a roll call to
reflect attendance during the meeting for the record. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive absences from
regular board meetings without receiving respectful communication from the absent board member.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Early Hiring for Certificated Staff
AGENDA ITEM:
In a competitive hiring market, it is critical for the Kent School District to have the ability to hire qualified,
highly effective staff earlier than is allowed by the current budget and staffing processes.

In order to meet our goals of hiring highly effective employees that reflect our student population, have
bilingual skills, and/or the certification necessary for typically hard-to-fill positions, the District will require
support from the Board of Directors to offer 30 letters of intent and 25 unassigned contracts to candidates
that meet the needs of our students as part of our year-round recruiting efforts.
It is anticipated that these letters of intent and unassigned contracts will primarily be given to Special
Education Teaching and Inclusive Education Certificated Support Staff candidates for the 2025-2026
school year in support of the Title II recruitment efforts as presented to the board.
BOARD GOAL:
Goal 4: Investing in a Diverse Workforce and Inclusive Workplace Cultures

budget. There is no additional impact to the budget.
