Superintendent’s Announcements and Report
Superintendent Greg Baker acknowledged the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut. Since then,
there has been much discussion at the district, school and community level about school safety.
He indicated he feels prevention, intervention and balance are all important components of any
safety plan.
He also indicated the district has been reviewing The Bellingham Promise and the goal of getting
all students to graduation. One of the decisions made is to give students credit based on
proficiency. If students pass the High School Proficiency Exam (HSPE) in reading, writing,
science and/or math, they will receive .5 credit. By passing the end-of-course exam in algebra,
geometry and/or biology, they could receive up to 1.0 credit.
The Facilities Planning Task Force has reconvened following the winter break. They have been
reviewing survey data with a goal of submitting their recommendations to the superintendent by
the end of January.
Dr. Baker announced January is School Board Recognition Month and expressed his
appreciation, and that of the staff, for the work of the board and presented them with a token of
appreciation.
