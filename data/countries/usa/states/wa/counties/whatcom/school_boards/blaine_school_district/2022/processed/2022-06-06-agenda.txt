Public Content
On May 25, 2022, a threat to the school campus resulted in a lockdown and law enforcement response.
All Pre-K through Grade 12 students and staff were evacuated from the school buildings, and
reunification with families continued until approximately 7:15 p.m. As a result of this traumatic event,
schools remained closed on May 26 and May 27. At this time, the board is asked to adopt Resolution
2122-11 which authorizes an application to OSPI for the waiver of those two (2) missed school days.
NOTE: The Emergency School Closure Waiver Request was attached at 7:55am on 6/6/2022.
