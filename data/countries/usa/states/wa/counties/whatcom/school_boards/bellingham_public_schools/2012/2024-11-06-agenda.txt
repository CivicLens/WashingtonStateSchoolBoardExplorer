Explanation of Issue:
Each year the high school athletics/activities coordinators and ASB bookkeepers review the list of ASB student activities pay
rates to ensure the rate structure complies with the necessary minimum wage law and the needs of the programs it supports.
For 2012/13 a slight increase is needed in ASB Card and Athletic Fees to offset the extra costs for adding coaches to programs
with extremely large number of participants. The yearbook costs are increased due to increased costs from the vendor.
Yearbook costs have not been increased in over five years.
I recommend that the Board of Directors approve the following modifications to the fees schedule:
To take effect at the beginning of the 2012-2013 school year:
a. Increase the Athletic Fees First Sport ASB fee portion from $35 to $45 for Full Cost students
b. Increase the Athletic Fees First Sport ASB fee portion from $15 to $25 for Free/Reduced Cost students

c. Increase 1st Semester Year Book costs from $40 to $50
d. Increase 2nd Semester Year Book costs from $55 to $65
e. Increase High School ASB Card costs as follows:
· Full Cost Student - $35 increased to $40
· 2nd Semester - $17.50 increased to $20
· Reduced Student - $15 increased to $20
· Replacements - $15 increased to $20
· Refunds 1st Semester - $17.50 increased to $20
