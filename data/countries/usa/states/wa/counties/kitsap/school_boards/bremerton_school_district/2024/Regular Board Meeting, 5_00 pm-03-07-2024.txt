Background Information:
We honor the first people of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of the Suquamish
Tribe of Indians.
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its Indigenous
People, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or under-served.
This Land Acknowledgement is a formal statement that Bremerton School District recognizes and respects Native Peoples as traditional
guardians of the land and the enduring relationship that exists between Native peoples and their traditional territories.
We would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is within the ancestral territory of the suqabs People of
Clear Salt Water (Suquamish People). Expert fisherman, canoe builders and basket weavers, the suqabs live in harmony with the
lands and waterways along Washingtons Central Salish Sea as they have for thousands of years. Here, the suqabs live and protect
the land and waters of their ancestors for future generations as promised by the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855.
We also acknowledge the enduring presence and deep traditional knowledge of the indigenous people with whom we share this land today.

March 11-15 is School Support Professionals Week (formerly known as Classified Staff Week). This tradition started in 1975
to recognize the contributions of Education Support Professionals in the public school system and acknowledge the difference
they make in our schools!
More than 340 education support professionals work with and help students throughout the Bremerton School District. These
staff members work to maintain school buildings and grounds, provide administrative support, prepare and serve meals, provide
safe transportation, keep school facilities clean and safe, promote and support student and staff health and wellness, assist in
the classrooms, provide information technology and media services and more.

President Rotter will read the names of all of our classified employees with 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 years of service*. The
Board will be asked to approve a resolution for School Support Professionals Week later in the meeting.

Updated list was uploaded on 3/7/24 at 1:35 PM.
