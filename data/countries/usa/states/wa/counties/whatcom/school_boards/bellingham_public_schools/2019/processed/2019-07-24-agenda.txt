Explanation of Issue:
On May 20, 2019, at 10:05 a.m. the district opened bids for cardlock and/or on-site fueling services. Two
bids were received prior to the submittal date and time, from Reisner Distributor and Coleman Oil. The
Reisner Distributor bid included both cardlock and on-site fueling services. The Coleman Oil bid included
on-site fueling services only. After issuing the call forbids, it was determined that on-site fueling wouldnot
be a viable option for the district at this time.

After consultationwith legal counsel, it is recommended that the board accept resolution 12-19, rejecting
all fueling servicebids. Staff will be seeking board authorization to immediately call for bids with revised
specifications in a subsequent board item.

Services

Meeting :

Jul 24, 2019 - Special Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff has submitted the request outlined below in
connection with fueling services for the 2019-20 school
year. As superintendent, I have reviewed this request and
support board authorization to call for bids.

Explanation of Issue:
The transportation department provides transportation services to students which requires daily fueling of
buses and other vehicles. Other users of fuel services in the district include buildings and grounds, traffic
safety, technology, food services, warehouse, and school vans. The contract with Reisner Distributor
expires August 31, 2019. Given the district wants to continue offering transportation services to students
and other district vehicles, we need board authorization to call for bids for fueling services for the 2019-20
school year and to include 4 one-year rollover provisions. I request board authorization to call for bids for
fueling services.

Consent
