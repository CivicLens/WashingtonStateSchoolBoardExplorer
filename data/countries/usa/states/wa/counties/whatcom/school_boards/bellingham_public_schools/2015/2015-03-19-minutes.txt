OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location
March 19, 2015 – 1306 Dupont St., Bellingham, WA
Call to Order/Roll Call
Ms. Bashaw called the meeting to order at 6:15 p.m. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw
(Board President), Douglas Benjamin, Kenneth Gass, Camille Hackler, Steven Smith,
Superintendent Greg Baker, and recorder Ruth Rasmussen
Audience - No audience members presented.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report – Dr. Baker updated the board on the
following:
 Start/End Times Proposal: Dr. Baker has sent a message to staff, parents, and families
related to recent proposals to 1) consider extending the middle and high school day to
offer more course opportunities and electives for students and 2) adjusting start and
end times at all levels to expand the secondary school day and offer a later start time
for high school students. After talking with and hearing feedback from thousands of
individuals, including staff, students, and families, it was clear the proposed changes
for start/end times are not the best solution. The administrative team will continue to
work on a viable solution.
 Upcoming board study session on Family Engagement: Dr. Baker introduced Isabel
Meaker, Special Assistant to the Superintendent for Family Engagement, and Steve
Morse, Director, Teaching and Learning, to hear feedback from board members on
topics they would like to hear about during the May 7 study session. The board
members referenced a variety of items, including the Strengthening Families
program; Spanish/English lessons for families; Family Resource Center usage; and a
discussion of ideas for strengthening support to families outside of the school day,
including ways to engage families on how they might influence their students’
choices for continuing their education after graduation. Also mentioned was universal
early screening; i.e., what the community as a whole is doing to encourage this
practice.
 Hiring season: Open positions for 2015-16 are posted and the recruiting and
interviewing process is underway.

reviewed the district’s major work, including updates on the Lowell, Parkview, Happy
Valley, Options, Sehome, and conservation site projects. Mr. Cowan also discussed work
being done in connection with the energy efficiency and emergency response systems
grants.
CONSENT ITEMS
Dr. Gass suggested the board consider expanding EL 6, Academic Standards and
Practices, to incorporate some of the provisions within Administrative Policy No. 2255 –
Alternative Learning Experience Programs. Another option, he said, would be to pull
the EL-6 monitoring report off the consent agenda when it is presented annually so that
the superintendent can report in more detail on alternative programs.
