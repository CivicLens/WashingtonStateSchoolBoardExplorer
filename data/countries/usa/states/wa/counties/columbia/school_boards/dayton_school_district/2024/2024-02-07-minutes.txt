A. TOPIC 1 - K-12 Counseling Program
Elementary counselor Caitlin Patterson, secondary counselor Sasha Squires and prevention & substance abuse counselor Kristie Korslund gave an overview of our counseling program and the work each of them are doing in their specific area. The counselors are meeting regularly to develop a comprehensive counseling plan. The goal is to define the counseling program for Dayton School District so if one of our counselors leave their replacement will be able to continue services with little to no interruption.
  B. TOPIC 2 - Discipline Data
Dean of students Hannelee Farrell updated the board on the new Mobile MTSS system the district is piloting. Ms. Farrell has been working with MTSS developers to refine the system for our school district. MTSS is designed to help identify struggling students early and intervene quickly.
    C. TOPIC 4 - Superintendent Search
Superintendent Stewart updated the board on the next steps in the superintendent search process. The background checks are almost completed and it looks like there are four candidates moving to the final round. Our superintendent search consultant will begin Zoom interviews with the candidates this next week. Mr. Stewart proposed reviewing the application materials and information at the next board meeting. Board members can decide on how many candidates they would like to interview and set a date for doing so. The goal is to complete the process by spring break.
    4. ACTION ITEMS
Discussion was held on the grant FFA received for a new pick up and trailer. In order to be able to move quickly if a vehicle is found that meets with everyone's approval, the district would like to be able to issue payment for the vehicle and or trailer. The expenditure would not exceed $40,000 which is the amount of the grant. A contract will be drawn up to outline the terms of usage of the vehicle and the obligation of the district and FFA on who covers expenses.
