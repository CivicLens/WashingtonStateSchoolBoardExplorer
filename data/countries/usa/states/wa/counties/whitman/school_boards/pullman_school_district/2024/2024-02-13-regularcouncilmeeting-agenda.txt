As part of this adopted document, City Council has requested quarterly updates as to
the progress of these goals and priorities. This has occurred regularly via memos

By motion, approve the purchase of one new 2023
police vehicle.

Public Content
Public Works Maintenance and Operations (M&O) staff request authorization to
purchase one (1) new 2023 Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle (INTERCEPTOR).
Staff proposed and received approval to replace fleet vehicle 21-018 during the 20242029 Capital Improvement Project (CIP) process. The amended 2024 Equipment
Rental Division budget includes $86,900 for this purchase.
Due to ongoing delays and shortages in the automobile industry, Ford Motor
Company has approximately 60,000 unfulfilled orders for the 2023 production year.
Ford is not taking new orders for 2024; instead, Ford is opting to produce the
backlogged orders from 2023.Fortunately, a 2023 INTERCEPTOR became available
in January through the National Auto Fleet Group (NAFG), and staff obtained a quote
through a cooperative agreement with Sourcewell. Staff issued a letter of intent to
purchase the vehicle contingent upon Council approval. Staff subsequently solicited a
quote from Hells Canyon Upfitting and Sales for fitting the vehicle to Pullman Police
Department standards.
The City entered into a cooperative purchasing agreement with Sourcewell in 2018
(Resolution #R-27-18) and obtained the quote through contract #120716, awarded to
NAFG. This contract is competitively bid and meets the City's procurement policies.
In addition to the standard police package, this vehicle has vital safety features that
protect the City's Police Officers, including an on-demand rear camera, ballistic door
panels, blind-spot monitoring, cross-traffic alert, and perimeter motion alert.

Public Content
Public Works Maintenance and Operations staff (M&O) request authorization to
purchase a new one-and-a-half-ton 4x4 pickup up-fitted with a utility box and crane
for use by the WastewaterTreatment Plant (WWTP) Team to maintain assets at the
WWTP and sewage lift stationsthroughout the city. The service truckwas initially

approved through the WWTP 2022-2027 Capital Improvement Program process; this
is the second time staff has requested Council approval to purchase this truck, once
in 2023 and again this evening.
In 2022, the price had increased by $40,292.21from estimates generated during the
biennial budgeting process in 2021. In anticipation of additional increases this year,
the staff increased the 2024 budget item to $200,000.
Each time the price increases for a unit, the National Auto Fleet Group (NAFG)
requires contract approval by the Council. For that reason, M&O staff request the
Council approve this purchase by motion.
The City previously entered into a cooperative purchasing agreement with Sourcewell
(Resolution #R-27-18) and obtained the quote through contract #091521, which was
awarded to NAFG. This contract is competitively bid and meets the City's
procurement policies.
The proposed vehicle was evaluated according to Washington State alternative fuel
regulations and it was determined that an alternative fuel vehicle is not available that
meets operational needs.

Public Content
On January 9, 2024, Staff presented to Council about a grant opportunity for Fiscal Year 2024
through the WaterSMART Water and Energy Efficiency Program. Staffs presentation regarding
this grant is available here: 2024-01-09 Pullman City Council Meeting, beginning at minute 39:
33. At that time, Council directed staff to move forward preparing the grant with the
understanding that this would return for action at tonight's Council meeting's Consent Agenda.
If successful, the grant would fund up to fifty percent (50%) of the citywide project
implementation of Advanced MeteringInfrastructure (AMI), which would upgrade the municipal
water metering system to a technology that allows for real-time water usage data tracking to
staff and customers. This technology will result in water conservation, energy efficiency, reduced
emissions, and a more cost-effective water system management.TheAMI Upgrade Project is on
the Capital Improvement Program (CIP).
The grant application is due on Thursday, February 22, 2024.Award selections are expected to
be announced this June, with an agreement starting December 31, 2024. Projects awarded
Water and Energy Efficiency grants must be completed within three years of award.
The attached draft grant application package is not yet in its final form, as staff is putting the final
numbers and documentation together at the time this council agenda memorandum was
submitted. City Staff has provided their work up to that date for the Council to reference andwill
continue working to finalize this application package and grant proposal for submittal to the
Bureau of Reclamation. Letters of support from community organizations, institutions, agencies,
business owners, and political leaders are included in the application materials.
A preliminary budget estimate is at the end of the document. It is not broken down by year but
provided only as totals for the 3-year project. The budget will be submitted in the Bureau's
provided worksheet, not in the format presented here. The Personnel portion of the Budget

provides for a new Utility Engineer position to be added to the Engineering Division of Public
Works. This position would serve as the Project Manager for the AMI Implementation,
overseeing the Consultant and Contractor and ensuring proper communication with the public
and implementation of software and the customer portal. Dependent on the successful award of
this grant, staff plans to request this new permanent position with the 2025-2026 budget process.
Staff is requesting the adoption, by motion, of the attached resolution to execute the grant
application as well as authorize the acceptance and execution of the grant agreement if awarded.

City staff recommends a motion to approve the

Residential Development.

Public Content
The West End Villas Planned Residential Development is a proposal to divide
approximately 5.26 acres into 65 lots. The PRD includes the construction of 60
townhouses, four lots for open space, and one lot for a private road. The site for the
project is north of Pullman High School, located south of NW High Point Court and
east of NW Valley View Drive on Military Hill.
The current zoning designation at this location is R-2 Low-Density Multi-Family
Residential. The R-2 zoning district allows for a maximum density of 15 units per acre.
A planned residential development allows for flexibility and creativity in the layout and
design of new residential developments.
The Planned Residential Development did go through the site plan committee on May
30, 2023, and had 45 recommended conditions as outlined in the staff report.
The Planning Commission held a public hearing on June 28, 2023, on this item and
voted unanimously in favor of a recommendation of approval to the City Council. At
the public hearing on June 28, 2023, numerous individuals spoke against the
proposal. They cited traffic, parking, and neighborhood character as their chief
concerns. Attached are Planning Commission minutes that summarize those
concerns.
This agenda item originally appeared before the City Council on July 11, 2023. The
City Council remanded the item back to staff with the direction that the applicant
prepares and submits a traffic impact analysis regarding potential impacts associated
with this project proposal. Video from the July 11, 2023, City Council meeting can be
located here:https://youtu.be/ZS23hpSZZp4?t=3267. The content begins at the 54:25
mark of the meeting.
Subsequently, the traffic impact analysis from the applicant, was receivedDecember
15, 2023. A reviewof the analysis by staff from the Public Works Department
concluded that there is no significant impact with regards to traffic.
The City Council should approve, disapprove, or return to the developer for
modification or correction.
