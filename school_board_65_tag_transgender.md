## 2022-02-10 - LYNDEN_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

Some parents explicitly requested the removal of "obscene pornography" and materials related to Critical Race Theory.  

The meeting also included a discussion on potential policy changes driven by parental feedback. A parent threatened legal action against the school district unless they ceased COVID-19 related policies, including mask mandates and vaccination promotion. The board reviewed a draft letter to state legislators expressing concerns about the challenges posed by pandemic mandates.
