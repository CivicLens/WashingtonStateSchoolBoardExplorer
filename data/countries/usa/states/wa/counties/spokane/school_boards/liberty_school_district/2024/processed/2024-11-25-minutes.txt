LIBERTY SCHOOL DISTRICT
REGULAR SCHOOL BOARD MEETING
November 25, 2024
EJH Library
CALL TO ORDER: Board Chair Jeremy Engle called the meeting of the Liberty School District Board of Directors to
order at 6:00 p.m. The flag salute was given, and a quorum was declared. Others present were board members
Chad Cornmesser, Stephanie Stout, Chad Denny, and Superintendent Jerrad Jeske.
AGENDA REVIEW: No changes to the agenda were made.

SALUTE TO LIBERTY:
• Kyle Dodge congratulated the high school volleyball team for their 6th place finish at state. Also, Marie Denny was
the South Division Coach of the Year and Kendall Denny and Zoe Omlin were both selected to the all-league team.
• Kyle Dodge also congratulated the high school girl’s cross-country team for being recognized as the State Academic
Champions. Mitchell and Allison Hanegan both ran at state.
SUPERINTENDENT REPORT: The following was a part of Jerrad Jeske’s report:
• Enrollment numbers continue to stay steady at 563, not including TK.
• The admin team & I continue to get in classrooms each month. Every month we get into 6 classrooms. Would
like to report back that we continue to see great things going on in the classrooms.
• Jerrad Jeske recognized Transportation Supervisor Jenny Janson for her work to keep all of our bus routes going.
Since the beginning of the school year, we have had to rely on sub drivers to fill all of our routes. Big thanks to
Sharon Keno and Eric Smith for helping out.
• New bus driver Bruce Blood is finally on board. He is taking over one of the Fairfield routes.
• TOP THREE legislative PRIORITIES for this session:
Increase MSOC Funding-Materials, Supplies, and Operating Costs (MSOC)
The 2025 Legislature must immediately address the significant underfunding of allocations for Materials,
Supplies, and Operating Costs (MSOC). While staffing represents the largest expense for school districts,
there are many costs to running a school district which are non-staff related. The Legislature provides an
allocation to cover these costs by providing for Materials, Supplies, and Operating Costs (MSOC) at a
specific rate per student; however, state funding for MSOC has not kept pace with actual school district
costs.
Insurance costs
22-23 = $191,636.26
23-24 = $286,544.32 (49% Increase)
24-25 = $370,247.60 (32% increase)
Special Education
The 2025 Legislature must fully fund the cost of special education services. School districts have a legal
obligation to serve all students with disabilities in Washington, regardless of cost of services. Even with
recent funding enhancements, the gap between school district expenditures for special education and
related services substantially exceeds funding. This gap requires districts to continue to use local funding
sources, including local levies, to cover required costs.
Pupil Transportation
The 2025 Legislature must fix the pupil transportation formula to ensure it is more transparent,
predictable, and adequately funded. The Student Transportation Allocation Reporting System (STARS) has
consistently underfunded districts’ actual pupil transportation expenditures.
Maintenance Report:
• McKinstry, through a state grant, continues to look for ways to decrease our energy consumption at the high
school. Will report back their findings as soon as we receive them.
• Our high school wall continues to leak. Roofers have come out several times to address the issue. They believe
the bricks are becoming saturated. May need to reseal the bricks. More to come. Marshall has been looking into
this.
• Still no leaks on the elementary roof to date.

ELEMENTARY/JUNIOR HIGH REPORT: The following were a part of Alex Saywers report:
• November has felt like it flew by with lots of assemblies and activities.
• We held our K-5 Awards Assembly and our Red-Carpet Fashion Show on Halloween! Watching all of our students
show off their costumes was a blast!
• On November 6th our staff met together to continue our book study. We are reading a book titled Classwide
Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports: A Guide to Proactive Classroom. Management with our whole K-8
team, and so far, we have learned more about the ABCs of behavior. This is helping us work on our School
Improvement Plan as well.
• On November 7th, we had a lockdown drill and practiced our lockdown procedures. It was great to test our
routines and work to fix any issues we found in doing so.
• On November 8th, we held our Quarter 1 Junior High Awards Assembly where we awarded students for the
character trait of the quarter, academic students of the quarter, as well as honor roll and athletic participation.
• On November 8th we also had a K-12 Assembly, first focusing on sending off the Cross-Country team to state,
then on Veterans Day with Coach Hodl as our speaker.
• On Wednesday last week, we held our K-5 Awards Assembly focusing on the character trait of thankfulness.
• On Thursday, we started our conference schedule and our book fair. We have had some great meetings with
parents and Mrs. Cressey has told me the book fair has been doing wonderfully!
• Next Friday, our Junior High will take their first ASB field trip of the year to Eagles Ice Arena on December 6th.
• Looking ahead to December, we will have our K-4 music concert on Monday, December 16th starting at 6:00 in
the Lancer Gym at the High School. This year, we are having a STEAM Musical, so I am excited to see how that goes!
• During the week of December 16th to 20th, our Junior High Students will host a dress-up week, culminating in an
ASB Activity with inflatable obstacle courses on the 19th. Our K-5 classrooms will host Winter Celebration
Activities on Friday the 20th, as well as our K-5 Awards Assembly.
