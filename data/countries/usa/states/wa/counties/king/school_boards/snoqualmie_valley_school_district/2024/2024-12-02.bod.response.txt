Registered voters elect each board position from the entire school district for a four-year term. Board members (and candidates) must live in the geographic area that is assigned their specific board seat. Director districts are established every ten years, through the use of census data, to determine an equitable geographic distribution of board positions among the population. This system ensures representation on the board from throughout the district. Despite the geographic distribution of the director seats, each member is elected by all voters and is responsible for the entire school district. Community members may contact any member of the board. The current Director District map was adopted by the School Board in the Fall of 2022 and can be found below.
