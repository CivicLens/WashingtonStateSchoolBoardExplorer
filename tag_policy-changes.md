## 2018-04-18 - BELLINGHAM_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS (Agenda)

The Bellingham School Board scheduled a special meeting and public hearing on April 18, 2018, to discuss amending Resolution 14-13.

The public hearing will gather feedback both for and against the amendment. Following the hearing, the school board will consider approving the proposed change at their regular meeting immediately afterward.

This action aligns with RCW 28A.530.020, which mandates a public hearing prior to amending the list of eligible projects associated with a bond issue.

## 2015-07-16 - BELLINGHAM_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS (Agenda)

The Bellingham School Board scheduled a special meeting and public hearing on July 16, 2015, to discuss amending Resolution 14-13. This resolution, originally adopted on June 27, 2013, outlined eligible capital improvements funded by the 2013 bond issue. The proposed amendment aims to add the acquisition or construction of a new warehouse and portable classrooms to the list of eligible projects.

The need for a new warehouse arose because SCAP funds, initially anticipated for its construction, would not be available in time before demolition of the existing warehouse to make way for the new Options High School in June 2016. The amendment would allow bond proceeds to fund the immediate acquisition or construction of a new warehouse.

Additionally, the amendment seeks to include portable classrooms on the list of eligible projects. This anticipates future state funding for lower class sizes and aims to enable the district to acquire additional portables for expanded classroom space.  The public hearing is mandated by RCW 28A.530.020 before amending the list of eligible projects associated with a bond issue. Following the hearing, a regular board meeting will be held to vote on the proposed amendment.
