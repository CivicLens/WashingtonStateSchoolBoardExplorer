This resolution increases the maximum expenditures for the General Fund for the 2023/2024 school year
from $383,181,760 to $397,787,623. This extension of $14 million is being requested for the following
reasons:
Actual enrollment in October was significantly higher than forecasted resulting in the need to hire more
staff than were planned for including the staff included as contingency.
Since October, enrollment has continued to increase adding an additional 156 students to the district
resulting in greater revenue but also greater expenses in the form of student supports.
The anticipated higher special education costs that are currently expected to be $5+ million. This overrun
is the result of more students with higher needs. Additional educators and paraprofessionals have been
added. In addition, more students with the greatest needs are being placed for services outside of the
district.
Some additional capacity was also added to both the expense and revenue side in case enrollment
continues to increase and additional resources are necessary.
With the increase in revenue and expenditures we are currently estimating the ending fund balance to be
$20 million which would be 5% of the expenditures for the 2023/2024 fiscal year. If expenditures are
lower than being requested, the percent would be between 5-6% as outlined in Board policy. We are
asking the Board to approve this resolution increasing the budgeted expenditures for the 2023/2024
school year for the General Fund from $383,181,760 to $397,787,623.
