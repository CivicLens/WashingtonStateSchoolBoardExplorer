website. The meeting, that began at 6 pm, was held at Union Event Center. Directors Cannon,
Gray, Nolan and Killman were present. Director Burchard was excused. Also attending were

III.

Director Nolan made a motion to approve the minutes of the August 26, 2024 Regular Board
Meeting and September 9, 2024 Work Session, as presented. Director Killman seconded the

IV.
Remarks for the Good of the Schools – Public Comment on Agenda Items
President Cannon first opened the floor for board/staff comments followed by an update from
Mt. Spokane High School. There were no individuals who signed up to speak on agenda items.
Board/Staff Comments
Director Nolan referenced the upcoming Trades Night taking place on Wednesday, September
25th at Mead High School and extended an invitation to those in attendance and listening to the
meeting via Zoom to attend. He additionally, referring to the facility use fees for the 2024/2025
school year approved by the board on August 26th, noted for the record that the approved fee
schedule, which included no increase from the 2023/24 school year, falls short of covering actual
costs. While fees generated do not cover all expenses, providing an affordable rental option for
the community is a board priority.
Regarding the recent Cat Scramble Golf Tournament that benefits the athletic programs at Mead
High School and Mt. Spokane High School, President Cannon expressed thanks to both high
school athletic booster clubs for sponsoring this event that was started 24 years ago. In thanking
the many volunteers and community members who contributed to and participated in this
particular event, President Cannon also acknowledged the many, many volunteers who regularly
contribute their talents and resources in a variety of ways throughout the district.
Mt. Spokane High School Report
ASB President Jayson Bonnett presented a brief review of the academic, athletic, leadership and
music events recently completed and upcoming at Mt. Spokane High School. The school year
started with 9th Grade Orientation/School Tours including an assembly just for Freshmen on the
first day of school. The Homecoming Dance, with a Rio theme, took place September 21st. The
theme for the upcoming (September 27th) Battle of the Bell football game is Northern Lights. Both

soccer (girls) and softball are undefeated. The first GSL cross-country meet takes place on
September 25th. Cat Fight (Mt. Spokane vs Mead) volleyball will be played on the evening of
Tuesday, September 24th.

A. Consent Agenda B
In response to a question regarding the $2.8 million payment for errors and omissions insurance,
Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson noted the annual premium for the 24/25 school year
is up approximately $500,000 from the 23/24 school year. The cost of errors and omissions
insurance has almost doubled in the last two years. President Cannon expressed his appreciation
to voters for supporting the district’s local levy. Levy funds help cover increases in expenses like
this.
President Cannon reviewed the donations listed on Consent Agenda B and thanked those
individuals and organizations for their generosity and support of Mead School District students.
Director Gray made a motion to approve Consent Agenda B, as presented. Director Nolan
seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously.

B. Policy & Procedure 2418 Adoption
Waiver of High School Graduation Credits
Director of Secondary Education Jeff Naslund presented the adoption of Policy/Procedure 2418,
Waiver of High School Graduation Credits, for first reading, non-action consideration. This would
be a new policy/procedure for the Mead School District. This policy/procedure is considered by
WSSDA to be essential.
WSSDA Sample Policy 2418 and Sample Procedure 2418 were used as templates for the presented
policy/procedure adoption.
Prior to the board approving a revision on June 10, 2024, to Policy/Procedure 2410, High School
Graduation Requirements, that policy/procedure included a section on the waiver of high school
graduation credits. WSSDA removed that section from Policy/Procedure 2410 and now

recommends a stand-alone policy/procedure specific to the waiver of high school graduation
credits.
Policy 2418 recognizes there are, from time to time, unusual circumstances that may prevent a
student from earning the required twenty-four (24) credits necessary for graduation and sets
forth a list of such circumstances. It additionally authorizes the superintendent, or their
designee, the authority to grant a waiver of up to two elective credits. The waiver request must
be submitted using the district’s Credit Waiver Application Form and must be received no later
than 30 days prior to the student’s scheduled graduation date.
In order to graduate, students granted a waiver must still earn the required 17 core subject
credits through satisfactory completion or demonstration of competency as provided by WAC
180-51-050.
The procedure includes sections addressing the Determination Process and the Response Process
related to obtaining a credit waiver.
The presented policy/procedure complies with state and federal law and current district
practice.
In response to a question from Director Gray, Mr. Naslund confirmed the maximum number of
credits that can be waived is two and a credit waiver is never allowed for core subjects. During
COVID the number of waiver credits permissible was increased to four.
Regarding PE credits, Mr. Naslund shared a separate policy will be forthcoming to address that
specific area of credit waiver.
This was the first reading of a policy/procedure adoption. There were no first reading changes
recommended and no action was taken.
C. Policy & Procedure 3530 Adoption
Fundraising Activities Involving Students
Director of Secondary Education Jeff Naslund presented the adoption of Policy/Procedure 3530,
Fundraising Activities Involving Students, for first reading, non-action consideration. This would
be a new policy/procedure for the Mead School District. This policy/procedure is considered by
WSSDA to be essential.
WSSDA Sample Policy 3530 and Sample Procedure 3530 were used as templates for the presented
policy/procedure adoption.
The policy recognizes the need for guidelines when it comes to the solicitation of funds from
students, staff and citizens, as well as the need for assurances that the instructional program
will not be adversely affected by fundraising activities. Therefore, the policy directs the
superintendent (or designee) to establish rules and regulations for the solicitation of funds by
approved school organizations, official school-parent groups and outside organizations. The
policy further sets forth the expectation that all fundraising activities will enhance the
educational programs, activities and goals for the district.
The procedure notes that student participation must be voluntary and that fundraisers must
conform to district ASB accounting requirements. The procedure additionally includes a listing
of approved fundraising activities, a section on sponsorship opportunities, notation of who is
responsible to approve fundraisers generating less than $10,000 (principal) and more than
$10,000 (superintendent or designee) and specific rules that will govern fundraising efforts.

The presented policy/procedure complies with state and federal law and current district
practice.
In response to a question from President Cannon, Mr. Naslund shared that while fundraisers
may include incentives, students cannot be required to participate.
This was the first reading of a policy/procedure adoption. There were no first reading changes
recommended and no action was taken.
D. Policy & Procedure 6102 Adoption
District Fundraising Activities
Noting this policy/procedure pairs with the previous student fundraising policy/procedure,
Director of Secondary Education Jeff Naslund presented the adoption of Policy/Procedure 6102,
District Fundraising Activities, for first reading, non-action consideration. This would be a new
policy/procedure for the Mead School District. This policy/procedure is considered by WSSDA
to be discretionary.
WSSDA Sample Policy 6102 and Sample Procedure 6102 were used as templates for the presented
policy/procedure adoption.
While affirming it is the policy of the school board to ensure school sites remain focused on
education, the policy acknowledges permitting advertising or other commercial activity may, in
certain instances, offer an opportunity for the district to gain revenue.
Included in the policy is information on what district fundraising activities may include. The
policy governs the establishment and administration of district fundraising for the general fund
and for programs in the district. It does not address fundraising programs conducted by Parent
Teacher Organizations, other non-profit or citizens’ organizations or the Associated Student
Body. The policy additionally includes sections that address Advertising Activities and
Sponsorships & Partnerships.
The procedure sets forth guidance regarding what district fundraising programs may include
and the approval process for district fundraisers. Criteria is additionally set forth for the
following situations:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Fundraising programs charging fees.
Fundraising programs characterized as a “business enterprise” activity.
Fundraising programs using donated personal items or services for an auction,
sale, and/or raffle.
Fundraising programs requiring contracting with a third-party vendor or promoter.
Fundraising programs involving the production and/or sale of goods or services.
Fundraising programs where the selling of surplus school personal property is
involved.

The presented policy/procedure complies with state and federal law and current district
practice.
Regarding the Advertising Activities section of the policy, Director Nolan sought clarification on
the bullet that states, “Promotes food or beverage inconsistent with our competitive foods
policy”. Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson shared she will do some research on whether
or not that bullet is necessary and, if not needed, the sentence will be removed from the second
reading draft.
This was the first reading of a policy/procedure adoption. No action was taken.

VII.

Reports
A.
Technology Services Report
Technology Assistant Directors Dave Willyard and Emily Magney presented an update/report on
the work of the district’s Technology Department. Mr. Willyard and Ms. Magney reminded that
the primary objective of Technology is to provide tools. The implementation of the provided
tools to access technology in the classroom is under the Learning & Teaching umbrella. Report
highlights included the following:
•

•

•

Fall 2024 Chromebooks – At the end of the 23/24 school year all high school
Chromebooks, the majority of which were at end of life, were collected and replaced with
3,400 new devices. Work to have these new Chromebooks ready for deployment took
place during the summer. For the 2024/25 school year high schools and middle schools
will continue with a 1:1 model with elementary schools transitioning to a per grade level
cart model for grades K-2, one cart for every three classes at 3rd and 4th grade and 1:1 at
5th grade. Mead Learning Options will ratain a 1:1 model for all students.
Tech Work Orders – In sharing information on department Work Orders, Mr. Willyard
and Ms. Magney emphasized that customer service is a top priority. In the 23/24 school
year Chromebook issues represented 57% of total work orders. The department is
committed to having a short turnaround time for repairs to assure there is minimal down
time and students are supported in their learning. As Chromebooks age the volume of
repairs and turnaround time is anticipated to increase.
Parent App – Later this fall (October) parents will have access to monitor their child’s
web activity through an app or online dashboard. Members of the district’s community
Tech Committee has been piloting this new app.

Director Gray expressed her appreciation that the monitoring app will soon be available to
parents. In response to a question from Director Nolan, Mr. Willyard shared that an ideal cycle
for Chromebooks is four years. Middle school Chromebooks are in their 5th year and, as expected,
there are more repair issues.
Additional discussion included a request to hear from Learning & Teaching on the “why” for a
1:1 model and the idea of moving away from students taking their computer home each day.
Director Killman noted that technology is a very large expense for the district.
In response to a question from President Cannon, Mr. Willyard shared repairs to projector
devices generates the second most work orders. Regarding how work orders are prioritized, Mr.
Willyard noted district techs (four total) take care of 1st period problems before moving on to
other issues. There are 12 total employees in the Tech Department.
Superintendent Hanson personally thanked Mr. Willyard and Ms. Magney and the Technology
staff for their work. There are many, many facets that must be attended to to keep the district’s
network operational.
B.
Disability Month Report
Superintendent Hanson, noting that October is Disability History Month, shared the district plans
to be very intentional in bringing increased awareness to, and showing respect for, those with
disabilities. One in five students suffer from some sort of disability (learning, physical or mental).
C.
Superintendent’s Report
As referenced earlier by Director Nolan and President Cannon, Superintendent Hanson also
noted the upcoming Trades Night and the recent Cat Scramble Golf Tournament, thanking in
particular the corporate sponsors who generously support both events.

Regarding enrollment, Superintendent Hanson noted a formal report will take place next month,
but shared numbers are looking good. The district is over budget and slightly above where it
ended the 23/24 school year.
Superintendent Hanson expressed his appreciation to all who helped facilitate a smooth start to
the school year. Regarding the ongoing DLC staffing issues, he shared the district continues to
implement/work on creative solutions to the problem. In addition to continuing issues in hiring
para educators, there is also a bus driver shortage. Transportation is down seven drivers from
where it would like to be.
Regarding the ongoing work to update policies, Superintendent Hanson shared current focus is
on the 2000–Instruction series and that the board can expect a number of policies to be
forthcoming for their consideration.
VIII. Remarks for the Good of the Schools – Public Comment on Non-Agenda Items
Patrick Sheehy, addressed the board regarding serious operational issues in the district’s Highly
Capable program. He noted the requirement that a Highly Capable Plan be approved by the board
each year and submitted to OSPI. He expressed concern that the district did not retain a copy of
that plan and that he, therefore, had to obtain a copy from OSPI. Concerns were also raised
regarding the district’s failure to comply with requirements to have multiple objective criteria
to identify students as Highly Capable.
Regarding notification of qualification, Mr. Sheehy expressed concern that he was informed in
writing that the Multi-Disciplinary Team met on April 30, 2024 to assess and place children but
that the letter notifying parents of whether or not their child qualified for the HighCap
designation was dated April 23rd and taken to the mailroom on April 29th.
Mr. Sheehy requested the board carefully review revisions to Procedure 2190 that will be
presented in the near future and, because of the referenced inconsistencies, requested the board
consider taking proactive steps to address the students and parents who have been negatively
impacted.
