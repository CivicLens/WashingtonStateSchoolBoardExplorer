As a mother of five boys, including two graduates of North Thurston Public Schools, Gretchen has always been a strong advocate for K-12 education and inclusion. Growing up in Washington state, Gretchen learned the value of public education through participation in the performing arts, leadership, and much more. In turn, she has devoted herself to giving back to students as an active community volunteer for more than 25 years, serving leadership roles in youth sports, multicultural and equity groups, career and technical clubs, North Thurston Citizens for Schools, and our Board of Directors. Gretchen s life experience with a blended family has helped her lead through multiple lenses, including Special Education and College in the High School programs, athletics, arts and activities, and mental health. Gretchen believes in celebrating and honoring differences and addressing the individual needs of every child to help them achieve success. She is currently the Director of Career Connected Learning in a neighboring school district, where she provides opportunities for students to discover their career passion and enter the industry with recognized credentials in vocational disciplines (such as Natural Resources, Health Sciences, Mechatronics, and Business & Marketing). Gretchen believes there is a graduation pathway for everyone and is proud to support a K-12 system where students can discover passions and talents they can later use in the workforce. Gretchen is dedicated to the success of all students in our district and understands that partnerships with families, staff, and leadership are crucial in making this happen. Our community is very diverse in opinions, ethnicities, and experiences. My hope is that we can seek to understand each other respectfully and work together, so our students are the top priority, said Maliska, who is grateful for the excellent education three of her sons have received from this district. It is a privilege to work with district leaders and staff who are committed to our community. Every child deserves to feel included and welcome in North Thurston Public Schools.

She attended North Thurston Public Schools and graduated from Timberline High School. She went on to earn her B.A. in Business Administration from the University of Washington and started her career in the state Legislature. I m committed to providing students with more options based on their needs and developing additional services to better prepare them for college, work, vocational school, or entrepreneurship, she said. Tiffany herself has used her own knowledge, experience, and skills in a variety of jobs, including the state Senate, the Governor s Executive Policy Office, and as Legislative Coordinator for the Aging and Disability Services Administration. With a background in budgets and public policy, she went on to become a tax and financial consultant and eventually began investing in real estate. I still enjoy helping others, advising small business owners and non-profits, as well as mentoring aspiring entrepreneurs. Tiffany is very active in our community and has held leadership positions in several organizations. She was part of the Core Team to establish the Thurston County Coalition Against Trafficking and has been a volunteer instructor for a non-profit that teaches personal finance in low-income schools and learning centers. She also served as a Board Director and Treasurer for a private PreK-8 school. Through my professional and volunteer experience, I ve seen firsthand how much we can achieve with a shared goal when we listen to each other and work together, she said.

I love our district, and I m really proud of it, Tracy said. I have been connected to this district since I was in kindergarten! Being involved in the schools is a part of who I am. I want to work to ensure success for all our students, helping them become successful and contributing members of our community. My job is to listen and advocate. Tracy s focus includes ensuring students feel engaged and welcome in our schools. Even though we have a large district, we strive for students and families to feel that sense of community, she said. Being involved in extracurricular activities, whether sports, music, or clubs, is incredibly important in developing a well-rounded student and helping them want to be at school. Tracy also wants to ensure students have varying educational pathways, including choice schools and different ways to demonstrate competencies while still having a rigorous academic experience.
