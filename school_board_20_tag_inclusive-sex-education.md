The meeting on April 23, 2024, focused on the adoption of health and English Language Arts (ELA) curricula. The transition from FLASH to PTWY for elementary health education was discussed, highlighting the need for engaging content for younger students. The new curriculum meets state requirements for HIV education starting in 5th grade, with 8.5 hours allocated for health education in grades 5 and 6, and 16 hours for grades 7-12. The presentations emphasized the importance of comprehensive health education that respects student rights and responsibilities. In ELA, the committee reviewed the history of curriculum adoption, noting that the Wit and Wisdom program was rejected, while Wonders and Amplify CKLA were piloted. Concerns were raised about the suitability of the Wonders curriculum for special education students, and the committee acknowledged the differing preferences between primary and upper elementary teachers regarding foundational skills and engaging materials. The discussions underscored the necessity for curriculum transparency and responsiveness to diverse student needs.
