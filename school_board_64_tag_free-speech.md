The school board meeting focused on concerns regarding safety and appropriate conduct during public comment periods.  Dr. Dominguez recommended several changes to address these issues, including altering the room layout, requiring speakers to provide their name, address, and topic, limiting speaking time to three minutes, and implementing a "Sergeant of Arms" to enforce rules. The board unanimously agreed to these recommendations. Additionally, Mr. Childs suggested acknowledging emergency exits at the beginning of meetings and maintaining a sign-in roster for evacuation purposes.  The need for clearer communication regarding public comment expectations was also emphasized, with suggestions to reach out to individuals and provide Webster's Dictionary definitions of relevant terms.
