Public Content
Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer, Director of Capital Projects

Explanation of Issue:
In June 2010 the Board adopted Policy 6800 in order for the district to comply with state regulations pertaining to the Asset Preservation
Program (APP). We must comply with APP in order to be eligible for state construction assistance funding for future school modernization
projects.
One of the specific requirements associated with APP is that on or before April 1 of each yearthe school boardwill receive an annual report
pertaining to the condition of the districts facilities that were built after December 31, 1993, and for which the district received state
construction funding assistance. The affected facilities in our district are Birchwood and Happy Valley elementary schools;Fairhaven,

Kulshan, and Shuksan middle schools; and Bellingham and Squalicum high schools. Sehome High School will be included in the 2020 report
but does not need to be included this year even though it meets the APP criteria.
Please note that extraordinary conditions caused by COVID-19 delayed site visits and final documentation this year, and OSPIallowed an
extension to complete this important work.
OSPI requires that every 6 years the building conditions be assessed by outside experts certified by OSPI, and because this is our sixth year
the assessment was conducted by ZervasArchitects.
The attached documents are the 2019 building assessment reports prescribed by OSPI. The Condition Rating is a summary rating taking
into consideration the condition of all major systems at each school including foundations, walls, roofs, windows, doors, electrical, plumbing,
heating, etc. All of these ratings exceed the OSPI Building Condition Standards.
The reports may be reviewed here.
