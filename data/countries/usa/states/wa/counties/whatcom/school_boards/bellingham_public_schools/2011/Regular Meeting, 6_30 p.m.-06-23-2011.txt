Explanation of Issue: Revision of Policy and Procedure 3207 Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TO: Dr. Greg Baker, Superintendent
FROM: Tom Venable, Deputy Superintendent
DATE: June 17, 2011
SUBJECT: Revision of Policy and Procedure 3207 Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying
After reviewing the Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA) proposed changes to Policy and Procedure 3207, I
am recommending that the Bellingham School Districts policy and procedure be deleted and replaced with the WSSDA model.
Over time the Districts policy and procedure has been reviewed, revised, and modified, and would need major updating to
capture the essence of the proposed WSSDA changes and to be consistent with changes in state law.
Theadministration is recommending School Board approval.

Explanation of Issue: Revision of Policy and Procedure 3210 Equal Educational Opportunity: Nondiscrimination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TO: Dr. Greg Baker, Superintendent
FROM: Karst Brandsma, Acting Deputy Superintendent
DATE: June 15, 2011
SUBJECT: Revision of Policy and Procedure 3210: Equal Educational Opportunity: Nondiscrimination
There are several federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination andin 2010, the Legislature passed a state law that focused
on prohibiting discrimination in public schools. The Legislature stated they desired to place a specific acknowledgement in school
law on the right of public schools to be free from discrimination.
The law specifically provides:
"Discrimination in Washington State public schools on the basis of race, creed, religion, color, national origin, honorably
discharged veteran or military status, sexual orientation including gender expression or identity, the presence of any sensory,
mental, or physical disability, or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability is prohibited...."
The revisions define sexual orientation to include "gender expression or identity" and includes "the use of a trained dog guide or
service animal by a person with a disability." The sample WSSDAmodel policies were used to determine recommended
changestothe Bellingham School District's policies and procedures.
Theadministration is recommending School Board approval.
