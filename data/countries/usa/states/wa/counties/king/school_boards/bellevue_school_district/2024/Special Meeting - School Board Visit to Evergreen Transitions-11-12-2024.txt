Special Meeting - School Board Visit to Evergreen Transitions
Time: 7:15 am
The Board of Directors will hold a visit with students, parents/caregivers, educators/staff, and the principal
and other building leaders.
The purpose of this meeting is to allow the Board to interact directly with the different stakeholder groups
in the school community so Board Directors can learn more about the specific strengths, needs,
initiatives, programs, culture, and challenges of the school.
To ensure all stakeholders in the school community have time to hear from and share with the Board, the
visit is organized into specific sessions for conversations with each stakeholder group.
Attendance is available online via the Video button that will appear on this page on the day of the
meeting. In person attendance is also available:
