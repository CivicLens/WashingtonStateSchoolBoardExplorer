AGENDA ITEM:
Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Early Hiring for Certificated Staff
AGENDA ITEM:
In a competitive hiring market, it is critical for the Kent School District to have the ability to hire qualified,
highly effective staff earlier than is allowed by the current budget and staffing processes. In order to meet
our goals of hiring highly effective employees that reflect our student population, have bilingual skills, and
/or the certification necessary for typically hard-to-fill positions, the District will require support from the
Board of Directors to offer an additional 10 unassigned contracts to candidates that meet the needs of
our students as part of our year-round recruiting efforts. It is anticipated that these unassigned contracts
will primarily be given to Special Education Teaching and Inclusive Education Certificated Support Staff
candidates for the 2024-2025 school year in support of the Title II recruitment efforts as presented to the
board.
BOARD GOAL:
Goal 4: Investing in a Diverse Workforce and Inclusive Workplace Cultures
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
Early hire positions will be included in staffing allocations according to the developed Kent School District
budget. There is no additional impact to the budget.
RECOMMENDATION:
That the board of directors approve this item.

Cedar Heights Middle School Audio-Visual System Upgrade
AGENDA ITEM:
Cedar Heights Middle School core team, stakeholders and Facilities are requesting approval to replace a
cart mounted audio-video setup in the existing commons area at Cedar Heights Middle School with a
ceiling mounted projector audio-video system. Having a ceiling mounted projector system is essential for
safety and daily school operations in the MPR. The current cart mounted method is extremely inefficient
at best for setup, operation, MPR management, and safety, with cords running across the floor.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
BUDGET IMPLICATION:

$36,432.21, including tax, has been forecasted for the 2023-2024 school year and will be paid from the
Cedar Heights Middle School budget.
Per RCW 28A.335.190 multiple bids are not required for work under $100,000.00.

RECOMMENDATION:
That the board of directors approve this item.

Mattson Middle School Catch Basin and Drainage System Upgrade
AGENDA ITEM:
Facilities is requesting approval to add catch basins and replace existing 3 drain lines with 6 drain lines in
the courtyard at Mattson Middle School. The core team, stakeholders at Mattson Middle School have
tasked Facilities to find a solution to circumvent repeated flooding events from heavy rains and a current
undersized drainage and sump pump system. The latest event on March 4, 2024, resulted in 4
classrooms and an electrical closet being flooded resulting in classes being moved to other spaces. This
solution will provide adequate gravity flow runoff for both courtyards and eliminate the dependence on a
sump pumps system.
