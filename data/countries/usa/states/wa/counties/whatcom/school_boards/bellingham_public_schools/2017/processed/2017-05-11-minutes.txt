BOARD STUDY SESSION
Board Study Session – Bellingham Public Schools’ Volunteer Program: Assistant
Superintendent Bob Kuehl, Cordata Elementary School Principal Analisa Ficklin,
Volunteer Coordinator Jennifer Gaer, and Alderwood Elementary School Volunteer Sue
Webber joined the board for this study session. The group shared a PowerPoint and
reviewed the progress made in the past several years in volunteer recruitment. Highlights
of discussion:
 A board community linkage meeting in 2014 was part of the catalyst for
enhancements to the volunteer program.
 Challenges in the past included site-based management of volunteer applications
and equity concerns, since some schools have a large volunteer presence and
others do not.
 Ms. Gaer shared parts of her entry plan that helped guide the district’s work in
this area in the past 12 to 18 months. An important step was her work with
Communications in developing the Volunteer Program webpage that was
launched with the district’s new website in September.



We now have nearly 3,600 approved volunteers in the database. Districtwide,
volunteer service totals on average 6,000 hours monthly. Next steps include a
more in-depth look at the impact of the volunteer program on student outcomes.
 Ms. Webber discussed her experiences and responsibilities as a volunteer with the
district, and Analisa Ficklin described the impact of the volunteer program on
students from a principal’s perspective.
 Ms. Peterson said there would be advantages to having a program in which some
volunteers worked with a student on a continuing basis, following them from
elementary to middle to high school.
 Ms. Diaz Hackler recommended that a future issue of Inside Schools include an
article on the volunteer program.
Following the study session, the board recessed briefly.

BOARD RESPONSE TO MONITORING
Board Response to Monitoring – EL-2: At the April 20 regular meeting, the consent
agenda included a monitoring report on EL-2, Organizational Continuity. The directors
now discussed whether the superintendent is in compliance with the policy and whether
any changes to the policy are warranted. Following discussion, the directors concluded
that the superintendent is in compliance and no policy changes are needed. (See

It was agreed that a future board meeting would include either a study session or a board
update on the district leadership work currently underway with Aspiring Administrators,
New Administrators, Administrative Interns, and the Dean Cohort.
Board Response to Monitoring – Ends 2.1 (part 3): At the April 20 regular meeting,
the agenda included the Ends 2.1 (part 3) monitoring report and data set. The directors
now discussed whether the superintendent has achieved the goals established in the
policy and whether changes to the policy are warranted. Following discussion, it was
agreed that the superintendent is making reasonable progress towards achieving the goals,
but a greater degree of progress is expected. (See Attachment B for summary of
comments.) Additionally, Dr. Smith made a motion to amend Items 4 and 5 in the policy
as follows:
 Item 4: All children of the Bellingham Public Schools community shall make
continuous advancement toward on-time graduation and extended graduation
in comparison to high-performing districts.
 Item 5: After graduation, student participation in post-secondary education
and career preparation shall increase and exceed participation than in
comparable high-performing districts.
Motion passed (4 in favor; 1 opposed) (See Attachment B.1 for revised policy.)
