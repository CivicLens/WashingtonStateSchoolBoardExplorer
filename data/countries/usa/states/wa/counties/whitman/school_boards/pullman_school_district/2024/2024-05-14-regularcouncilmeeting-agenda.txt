Public Content
The construction of Neill Public Library's Heritage Addition was funded by a generous
donation from the Ivan Shirrod and the Shirrod Family Memorial Fund and continues
to fund the maintenance and upkeep of the Heritage Addition. This fund is
administered by the Innovia Foundation, and the granting process requires the
Pullman City Council to authorize the receipt and expenditure of money from the fund
as per the library's funding proposal. This item was budgeted previously. It is the
staff's recommendation the Pullman City Council approve, by motion, the acceptance
of this funding as the staff finds the request is in keeping with the directives for the
use of these funds.
Staff is pleased to inform Pullman City Council of this distribution, which is a fitting
example of the community's generosity and support of Neill Public Library.

Authorize the execution of an Interlocal Agreement for Fire

Protection and EMS Services between Washington State
University and the City of Pullman for the period of January
1, 2024 through December 31, 2026.

Public Content
The city of Pullman and Washington State University (WSU) have had several
interlocal agreements for the provision of fire protection and emergency medical
services by the City to the main campus of WSU since 2005. The most recent
agreement expired on December 31, 2023. Negotiations on a new agreement were
completed in quarter 4 of 2023 and reviewed by the WSU Contract Office which
caused a slight delay in receiving it. Under the terms of the new agreement, the
amount to be paid by WSU will be 16.2 % of the actual Fire Department expenses
less major capital for the previous calendar year as determined by the Finance
Department year-end report. The percentage was primarily determined on the last
three years of historical response data to the main campus of WSU relative to the
total fire and medical calls for the entire City.
In 2023, the total amount paid by WSU was approximately $1,379,951. For 20242026, the total amount that WSU will pay will be 16.2 % of the final Fire Department
actual expenditures, less major capital, as determined by Finances year-end report.
The estimate for 2024 will be approximately $1,400,000. The agreement will be
retroactive to the first of this year.
The proposed agreement continues to reflect WSUs commitment to supporting future
major capital expenditures such as fire apparatus, ambulances, fire facility
improvements, and major capital over $250,000 based upon an equitable sharing of
costs based upon 16.2 % of said major capital expenditure. The term of the proposed
agreement begins January 1, 2024, and runs through December 31, 2026.

Agreement for Council ratification.

Recommended Action :

By motion, authorize execution of a Cisco Enterprise
Agreement (EA) through CompuNet on state contract

Public Content
The City of Pullman utilizes a number of Cisco owned and managed services for a majority of IT network and
security infrastructure. Currently, software licenses are paid out on varying terms, dependent on the service
and when it was initiated. An Enterprise Agreement (EA) allows the City to better plan, procure, and budget for
contracted licensed services by co-terming these agreements and managing them through a more centralized
workflow.
The Cisco EA contract would be renewed on 5 year terms, has an annual cost of $35,072 (including tax), for a
total of $175,358 over the term of the agreement. It has built in growth margins, opportunity to "true up" on
additional services year by year, and will allow the IT department to more succinctly budget while reducing
administrative overhead by managing multiple contracts.

Recommended Action :

By motion, ratify Change Order No. 2 to Contract 23-10,
Pullman Downtown Improvements.

Public Content
The scope of contract 23-10, Pullman Downtown Improvements, consists of the
improvement of East Main Street between N. Grand Avenue and SE Spring Street,
including water/sewer/storm mains, full road and sidewalk construction, traffic and
pedestrian signal construction, landscaping, and street furniture.
At the March 26, 2024 meeting, City Council directed staff to move forward with the
following design changes:
Striped parking stalls
Straightening the bike lane
Sidewalk widening and add a street tree at Ricos
Tree species modifications
Move trees in front of three businesses (Pups and Cups, Bruised Books, Neills
Coffee & Ice Cream)
Since said meeting, the design team made the necessary design changes and
provided the Contractor, Apollo, with a Work Change Directive (WCD) to begin
incorporating the changes and to solicit pricing for said changes. Many of the
changes did not require a formal change order because they only involved
adjustment of the pay quantities. However, the striping and irrigation contract pay
items are paid on a lump sum basis. Therefore, a change order was determined
necessary for adding striping to mark the street parking, and for the deletion of a
portion of the irrigation work in front of Ricos, which is a direct result of widening the
sidewalk there. The Contractor determined that there was an increase in tree material
costs between the original specified tree species and the proposed new tree species,
which also warranted a change order item for this design change.
Change Order No. 2 is attached to this staff report. There are other change order
items included that are in addition to the design changes mentioned above. These
are necessary to capture some other changes that have occurred during construction

to date. Please refer to the attached summary of work items for more detail on each
of the items in Change Order No. 2. The Public Works Director has approved and
signed Change Order No. 2 as authorized per Pullman City Code Section 1.107.140.
Staff now seeks ratification by the City Council of Change Order No. 2.
Lastly, at the March 26th meeting, there were three other design change items
regarding street furniture and fire lines. The addition of street furniture, has since
been added to the contract via Change Order No. 1, which was ratified by City
Council at their April 16th meeting. The request for tables and chairs will be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis with businesses as part of any future ground leases to utilize
the new sidewalk space for outdoor business use. All ground leases are subject to
City Council approval and those will be brought to City Council for their action in the
future. All necessary coordination between businesses and the Contractor, with
assistance from our design team, has occurred in regards to the requests to add fire
lines during construction.

Recommended Action :

By motion, adopt the attached resolution authorizing the

Cost Plus Fixed Fee Consultant Agreement between the
City of Pullman and Parametrix, Inc. for the Airport Road
Multimodal & Regional Access Improvements project.

Public Content
This project consists of design and permitting work only on Airport Road. The
project begins at Terre View Drive and terminates at the east city limit line near
Orville Boyd Road. This project aligns with the Citys adopted complete streets
policy and includes:
a roundabout at the intersection with NE Terre View Drive;
curb and gutter; a continuous center turn/refuge lane;
a 12-foot wide joint-use bike/pedestrian path along the south side of
Airport Road for the length of the project
a 7-foot wide sidewalk along the north side;
transit system access to the airport.
At their June 6, 2023 meeting, the City Council authorized the execution of a
Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE)
Grant Agreement to fund this design and permitting work. The said funding
amount is $1,050,000, with no local match required.
To select a consultant for this work, staff solicited statements of qualifications
from qualified consultants. The solicitation was prepared to include all required
federal provisions and a 14% mandatory DBE (Disadvantaged Business
Enterprises) goal, which was necessary to comply with U.S. DOT and WSDOT
federal requirements. The solicitation was advertised in the Moscow-Pullman
Daily News, the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce, and the Washington Office
of Minority and Womens Business Enterprises bid and contracting webpage.
Three statements of qualifications were received and evaluated by staff,
followed by a telephone interview of each firm. The firm selected through this
process was Parametrix, Inc. A scope and budget were then determined and
negotiated with Parametrix, Inc. The full scope of work is attached as Exhibit A
to the Local Agency A&E Professional Services Cost Plus Fixed Fee
Consultant Agreement. The project is to be performed on a cost-plus fixed fee
basis with an estimated budget of $1,019,976. Once the project is fully
designed, staff can then begin the process of seeking construction grant
funding, which is necessary for the project to move forward from design to
construction.
Staff is seeking Council authorization to execute a Local Agency A&E
Professional Services Cost Plus Fixed Fee Consultant Agreement between the
City of Pullman and Parametrix, Inc. for the Airport Road Multimodal & Regional
Access Improvements project.
