COMMENTS – BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
Ron Dinius – The Washington State School Directors’ Association (WSSDA) Legislative Assembly
will be held September 25, 2010 and conflicts with the date the board set for its annual work session.
Ron asked board members to consider an alternate date, bringing calendars to the next meeting to
reschedule the work session. Ron will attend a school finance workshop on August 12 in Olympia.
Elaine Pfeifer and Rosann Lassman will also attend. A community meeting is being held in
Vancouver, WA tonight for the governor to gather input regarding the state budget.
Rebecca Miner – The Feed Your Brain program is going great. The kids involved are learning lots,
and are eager to share their stories – it is very exciting. Rebecca shared with the board recent articles
from several newspapers and online news reporting regarding the program. Summer lunch numbers
have fluctuated this year, but are averaging in the 40s per day.
Teresa Baldwin – Teresa shared news about a large donation of school supplies recently received at
the district office from local patrons. She visited the summer school program at Excelsior High
School this morning. Mary LaFrance and Betty Millington are running the program, which is
allowing many students to earn credit over the summer.
4.
COMMENTS – CITIZENS
Gail Anderson – Gail asked to bring a concern of hers, which she has already shared with high school
and district administration, to the board’s attention. She is concerned that the addition of Advanced
Placement (AP) Calculus B/C at Washougal High School (WHS) will be problematic, due to the
small number of students enrolled in the course and the fact that it will be run with the standard
calculus class, which is a different curriculum. She feels that offering AP Statistics would have been
a better option.
