It is recommended that the Board approve the Contract
Usage Agreement (Interlocal Agreement) with the
Department of Enterprise Services.

Information: The Washington State Department of Enterprise Services isasking all state agencies and
local governments to sign a new Contract Usage Agreement to maintain access to our statewide
contracts for goods and services.
Background:In February of 2010, the Edmonds School District entered into the original agreement with
the Department of Enterprise Services (formerly known as The Department of General Administration)
that allowed the District to be a Cooperative Member participating in the State Purchasing Cooperative
Program. Statewide contracts leverage the states collective buying power to help the District save money
and time, reduce risk, and streamline purchasing. This is a one-time refresh for all statewide contracts
users.

Information: Interlocal Cooperation Agreement with Virtual Prep Academy for 2024 and 2025 school
years required state testing.

Background:The Edmonds School District has been administering state assessments to students who
are enrolled in online alternative learning experiences offered as virtual programs since before the 201415 school year. The Virtual Prep Academy in the Starbuck School District is a new program offering an
alternative virtual learning experience to students who reside within the Edmonds School District but are
not enrolled in an Edmonds School District school.
A blanket policy of not testing non-enrolled resident students would likely be in violation of WAC 392-121182, section 6, paragraph C: "Students enrolled full-time in nonresident alternative learning experience
schools, programs, or courses shall have the opportunity to participate in any required annual state
assessments at the district of residence, subject to that district's planned testing schedule."
This interlocal agreement allows us to charge the virtual learning program for these testing activities,
which is recommended per OSPI. We are currently charging $150 per student to cover the cost of hiring
proctors for the test sessions. The students are centrally tested and all coordination/ planning occurs at
the district office.
This year we had 2 organizations reach out to request that we test a total of 5 students.

Background:
All disbursements made by the district are by warrant or by imprest checking account and procurement cards which are
reimbursed by warrant. Before disbursements are made they are carefully checked for accuracy and proof that the
goods or services have been received, are satisfactory, and that previous payment has not been made. All vouchers for
payment of goods and contract services are approved by the auditing officer and then listed on voucher registers which
are presented to the board for approval at the next regular meeting. Board approval of district disbursements is
required by RCW 42.24.080. Vouchers audited and certified by the auditing office required by RCW 42.24.080, and
those expense reimbursement claims certified by RCW 42.24.090 have been recorded and the listing made available to
the Board.
Policy # 6215 states in part, "All claims for the provision of goods and services, other than payroll, must be pre-audited
and certified by the district's appointed auditing officer/designee. The form shall provide for the authentication and
certification by such auditing officer that the materials have been furnished, the services rendered, and that the claim is
a just, due and unpaid obligation. Warrants shall be approved by a recorded affirmative vote of a majority of the
board."

Replacement Project.

Public Content
Information:
Approval authorization to use the GC/CM Project Delivery Method for the College Place Elementary and
College Place Middle Schools Replacement Project. Through project checklist procedures, the Capital
Projects Office (CPO) has determined the General Contractor/Construction Manager procurement is the
best method for replacement of College Place Elementary and College Place Middle Schools.
Background:
During the development of the 2024 Construction Bond proposal and in subsequent discussions, the
Board of Directors indicated an interest in continuing the use of the GC/CM Project Delivery Method,
where appropriate, based on the district's use of and success with GC/CM on previous projects.
Per RCW 39.10, school districts must obtain permission from the States Project Review Committee
(PRC) to use GC/CM. The statute also allows School Districts to apply either on a project basis or for
Agency Certification. Agency Certification authorizes a District the choice to use the GC/CM alternative
delivery method on projects that meet the criteria specified in RCW 39.10.340 for a three-year period.
The Project Review Committee granted the Edmonds School District a three-year Agency Recertification
on May 26, 2023. As part of the Districts application for Agency recertification, we committed to
formalizing the School Board approval of GC/CM for each project.
The selection of Architects and Contractors for this project is underway. Approval of this agenda item
would advance the College Place Elementary and College Place Middle Schools Replacement Project,
and allow CPO to move forward with the GC/CM selection.
