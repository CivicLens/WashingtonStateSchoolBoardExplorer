Staff submitted the attached Resolution 22-23, Fixing and
Adopting the 2023-24 Bellingham School District Budget. As
superintendent, I have reviewed and approved the proposed
2023-24 budget and fully support its adoption and the
approval of Resolution 22-23.

Staff Contact: Kathryn Weilage, Chief Financial Officer
Explanation of Issue:
Resolution 22-23, if approved by the board, will formally adopt the 2023-24 Bellingham School District
budget.
Theproposed 2023-24 budget is attached. This includes the district's budget book and the state required
budget documents, Form F-195 and F-195F. Copies of these documents have been distributed toboard
members and madeavailable for members of the public.
General Fund expenditures for 2023-24 are projected at $214,646,427, a decrease of $4,862,473 (2.2 %)
compared to 2022-23 budgeted expenditures. This decrease is the result of budget reductions following
the loss of federal ESSER funding, inflation impact on the costs of supplies and services, enrollment
decline and a decrease in our district regionalization factor, further increasing the gap between state
funded salaries and the mandatory obligations associated with collective bargaining agreements.
After a careful2023-24 budget process and a thorough review of the budget assumptions and resulting
calculations, the 2023-24 budget is presented for adoption in accordance with Resolution 22-23.
