May and June Recognitions
○

On the last day of school, we had our recognition assembly and our class competitions. Since we
acknowledged our May Rise-Up students in our April assembly, all we did was recognize our
PERFECT ATTENDANCE students and our one staff member. After that we got into some super
fun games where the 6th grade, 7th grade, and staff competed for prizes and early lunch dismissal

the first week of school this fall! The 6th grade class won the rock, paper, scissors championship.
The staff won the shoe relay race with only one staff hamstring injury…. The 7th grade won the
crowd favorite egg toss competition! Headed into next fall our 8th grade class will start with early
lunch and control of the spirit stick to start the year!
●

Perfect Attendance
○

The staff member and students that were recognized with perfect attendance all received a
framed certificate for their dedication and commitment to being at school EVERYDAY! (picture

Students - Jaden Lenhard, Jayce Zhu, and Donald Lenhard

June Safety Drill (Full Level Lockdown)
○

This month CJHS participated in a full level lockdown drill on June 10th. The drill went smoothly
and the staff and students did a great job in running a successful drill.

●

8th Grade Promotion and Dance
○

On June 12th we recognized and promoted the class of 2028 in our drive thru promotion. The
college parking lot was completely packed and the weather was perfect for the event. Friends,
family, and staff cheered as we recognized the individual students from the class of 2028. Director
Naff led the night off as his daughter was the first student to be recognized as a Crimson Hawk!
After the drive thru event, we transitioned back up to the junior high cafeteria for the 8th grade
dance. The soon to be Crimson Hawks behaved extremely well at the dance and a good time was
had by all!

●

8th Grade Silverwood Trip
○

The day after the promotion and dance we took two full busloads of 8th graders on the end of year
Silverwood trip. I was lucky enough to chaperone this year and the weather was perfect and the
students had a great time! This is always a special trip for our 8th graders and for some of our
students it is their first time ever being at a theme park like Silverwood. It is pretty awesome that
our District and Board of Directors allow our students to take this annual trip!

●

Special Thanks
○

On behalf of all the staff at CJHS I would like to thank the Board of Directors for all their support
and dedication this school year. We appreciate the leadership and time you put into the schools
here at Colville School District!

Facilities
The last week of May the Maintenance Crew demoed the counter and column in room 215 at Fort Colville in
preparation for new flooring. We are installing new flooring and removing countertops to increase the square
footage of open space. Last year we made the same modifications to a different room for a student with special needs
and it was a success.

During the same week we also installed a new frost free hydrant at the Fort Colville baseball fields and rebuilt the
frost free at CHS.
The first week of June was all about Graduation. Included mowing, weed eating, blowing down and painting of
parking lots/curbing, placing bark in all flower beds, etc.
The second week of June we have a good start on Summer projects. The CHS track project is underway. As I am
writing this report, the track crew are removing the top layer from the track and placing material in construction
dumpsters. Demo on the track is expected to take until the first part of July. The project is going well so far. We also
have a good start on the foods room at CHS. We are removing a wall and installing new stainless counter tops along
with a commercial dishwasher and three bay sink. This project will be finished up by the start of next school year.
We are expecting the delivery of two walk in cooler/freezer combos in July. One cooler will be placed at Hofstetter
Elementary and one at Fort Colville. The coolers will be operational for the coming school year.
This summer will be a busy one. Along with all of the annual inspections, we have a sizable to do list. I would like
to say thank you to all of the Maintenance/Custodial staff.
As usual, if anyone has any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me. Thanks again.
