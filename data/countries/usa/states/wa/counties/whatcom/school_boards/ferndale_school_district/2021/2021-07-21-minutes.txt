  MATTERS RESERVED FOR BOARD ACTION
3.01 Resolution Authorizing Bond Sale
Mr. McLaurin reminded the board that voters approved a $112 million bond in February 2019. The bond was sold in three batches: the first in June 2019, the second in August 2020, and the board was being asked to approve the third sale, a $32.5 million bond, at tonight’s meeting, he said.
  The third bond sale was not to exceed $32.5 million, Mr. McLaurin said.
  Mr. McLaurin then introduced Dave Trageser, managing director of financial planning company D.A. Davidson, and Cynthia Weed, counsel from the law firm K&L Gates, to discuss the bond sale.
  Mr. Trageser said that because of historically low interest rates, the taxpayers will likely save money on this final bond sale. If conditions remain where they are currently, the tax rate will shrink from an estimated $1.66 per $1,000 of assessed value to $1.31 per $1,000, and the bond will be paid off over 16 years instead of 20, he said.
  Ms. Weed added that this legal resolution states that the district is borrowing $32.5 million, and promises to pay it back. She noted that the resolution – a very thick document – is mostly legal minutiae about that agreement.
  Dr. Erickson moved to approve the bond sale. The motion carried unanimously.
  Dr. Quinn said that the reduced tax rate and shorter time it will take to pay off the bond is a great deal for taxpayers.
  4. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
  4.01 Discussion of 2021-22 School Year Budget and Plans to Use One-time Federal ESSER Funding
Mr. Deebach began by displaying the F-195 budget document, which is the state-required format. However, he admitted it isn’t the most user-friendly version.
  Mr. Deebach then showed the board the Citizen’s Budget, which is an easier-to-read version of the document. He ran through the highlights of the budget, including a $5 million bump in federal funding.
  The district is planning to use $5 million of the fund balance to make up for an expected deficit, Mr. Deebach said. However, he said that $5 million number comes from a conservative estimate of enrollment growth, and he believes the district likely won’t have to dip that far into reserves.
  A board member asked if there will be issues when the one-time federal funding bump (known as ESSER) runs out after three years. Dr. Quinn said any position added with ESSER funds is explicitly marked as a three-year position.
  Another board member was concerned that the budget showing a major boost in federal funding would make some locals less willing to vote in favor of an operations levy. They wanted the district to emphasize to residents that this federal money is temporary.
  Mr. Deebach then moved onto discussing how the district will spend its $9.2 million in ESSER funds over the next three years. The majority of funding will go towards new curriculum adoptions and hiring temporary staff to implement the new Multi-Tiered Support System, or MTSS, he said.
  Ms. Larrabee and Dr. Quinn briefly explained the Multi-Tiered Support System – a program aimed, in the short term, to help bring students back to pre-pandemic academic levels, and, in the long term, to make sure every student every year receives whatever supports they need to be successful. Dr. Quinn said she hopes to eventually host a separate board study session focused on this topic.
  Then, Mr. Deebach showed the board the state-required MSOC (Materials, Supplies & Operating Costs) disclosure form. This document shows how much the district spends on everything that isn’t employee salaries and benefits. The district plans to spend about $5.8 million more in this category than what the state is giving it, but that’s how it works out every year, Mr. Deebach said.
  Board members then started discussing the minutiae of board expenses.
  Dr. Quinn suggested sending one council member each year to the national school board conference. A board member said that could be difficult, because some board members may have trouble taking time off work. Another board member suggested offering a stipend for board members – especially those with children – to alleviate that potential problem.
  Mr. Deebach then displayed the F-195F budget, which is a financial forecast out to the 2024-25 school year. This document shows local tax revenue and student enrollment expected to rise, while expenditures slightly shrink over time.
  When a board member asked if the district could create a “citizen’s budget” for this long-term forecast, Mr. Deebach said he didn’t believe it would be useful.
  4.02 Implications and Considerations for Next Educational Programs and Operations Levy
Mr. Deebach discussed specific aspects of a potential programs and operations levy, likely to go to voters in February 2022, using the state’s levy forecast tool.
  Mr. Deebach said the maximum amount the district can collect from a levy is whichever generates the fewest dollars of these two collection options: the tax rate or dollars per pupil. So no matter how big a levy the district asks the voters for, the maximum amount it can collect in the 2023 calendar year is about $11.7 million, Mr. Deebach said.
  A board member noted that in the past couple election cycles, the levy has been framed around how much money the voter will have to pay, instead of how much they will give to schools.
  A board member asked if it makes sense to ask for a $1.50 per $1,000 levy now, and then raise the levy once ESSER money goes away.
  Another board member reminded the board that a balanced budget must be passed by Aug. 31, and that the plan is to hold a public hearing on the budget at the July 27 regular meeting. The board can then approve the budget that night, or at the Aug. 31 meeting, but the board member and Dr. Quinn agreed it would be better to approve the budget in July.
  Dr. Quinn said the rate and duration for a potential new levy must be decided and announced by December to be placed on the February 2022 ballot. But she told the board a decision should be made before then, perhaps by the early fall to allow enough time to provide information to the public.
  Mr. McLaurin said the board didn’t plan on making a decision on a future levy tonight, but he appreciated learning what the board’s options are. Dr. Quinn said that if the board passes the budget at July 27, the board could discuss the levy again at their August meeting.
  The board members all agreed that the school district should ask voters to pass a levy in February 2022.
  Mr. McLaurin thanked Mr. Deebach, Dr. Quinn and the executive team for their work in planning out the budget.
    5. EXECUTIVE SESSION
10.01 The board will convene into executive session for approximately 20 minutes to discuss the details of the interim superintendent contract. No action will be taken during the executive session. The board may or may not take action when they return to open session.
  Mr. McLaurin adjourned the regular session at 8:57 PM, and after a brief break, the board entered executive session.
  The Board returned to open session at 9:47 PM. Mr. McLaurin said that no action will follow the executive session.
  6. ADJOURN
The meeting was adjourned at 9:48 PM.
