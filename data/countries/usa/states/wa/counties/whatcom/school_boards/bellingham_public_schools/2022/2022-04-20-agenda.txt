2.3 Resolution 5-22, Unlimited Tax General Obligation
Bonds, 2022

Meeting :

Apr 20, 2022 - Regular Board Meeting and Study
Session

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached resolution in connection with
unlimited tax general obligation bonds. As superintendent,
I have reviewed and approve this item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent of Finance
Explanation of Issue:
Resolution 5-22 authorizes the issuance and sale of unlimited tax general obligation bonds of the district
in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $60,000,000 to provide funds for the acquisition,
renovation, upgrade, new construction and equipping of school facilities of the district. It delegates to the
superintendent of the district the authority to determine the final structure and details of the bonds.
A 'delegation resolution' grants temporary authority to the superintendent to approve the final structure,
interest rates, maturity dates and principal maturities associated with the bonds and the authority to
accept a bid for the sale of bonds. The advantage of a delegation resolution is that it allows the district to
quickly enter the bond market when conditions are favorable, adjust the structure of the bonds and
approve a bid, irrespective of the timing of a board meeting, within the bounds of the parameters
established in the resolution. Without a delegation resolution, the district's only option is to enter the bond
market on the date of a regular or special board meeting which may or may not be a date that is most

advantageous to the district. You will notice several blanks throughout the document related to the form
of bonds and exhibits. These are provisions that will be determined as we get closer to the sale date. We
will provide the board with a report describing the final terms after the bonds are sold. We anticipate
conducting the bond sale around June 2, 2022.
