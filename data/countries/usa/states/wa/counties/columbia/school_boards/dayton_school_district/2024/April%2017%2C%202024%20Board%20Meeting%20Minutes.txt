students attended a play in the auditorium. The play was put on by the Walla Walla Summer Theater Group. The play
titled, A Little Bit of Magic, was an interactive play that shared that each child is special in their own way and also
encouraged the students to see the special and unique qualities in their peers. The play scripts were chosen to
support the Character Strong program. Progress reports have been sent home to families, included is an informational
letter about tutoring options. A required meeting for 6th grade families and students was held before we left for

Incoming superintendent Jeremy Wheatley was able to attend and get to know some of the other superintendents in
our area. Mr. Stewart facilitated having the Prescott superintendent mentor Mr. Wheatley due to the school districts
being similarly aligned in our administration models. Mr. Stewart proposed changing the next board meeting to May

week to allow for people to attend the In Plain Sight presentation at the Liberty Theater. Superintendent Stewart

6. ACTION ITEMS
A. Recommendation to Approve - Lease Agreement with City of Dayton
Superintendent Stewart reviewed the lease renewal with the City of Dayton for the athletic complex. The old lease expired in 2014 and
was not renewed. During a grant application the expired lease was discovered. The only changes would be the district would pay 100%
of the utilities (which is what we have been doing) and there would not be any rent payments from the district to the city. Discussion was
held regarding the lease start date and it was decided to begin the lease in 2024 for 50 years.
Board member Griffen moved, seconded by director Dieu, to approve the lease with the City of Dayton for the athletic
complex portion that belongs to the City of Dayton and for Superintendent Stewart to have the authority to sign the lease on
behalf of the district. Motion carried 4-0. Board member Ryan Paulson recused himself due to his employment with the City of
Dayton.
