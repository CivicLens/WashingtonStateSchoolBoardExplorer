Each time the Kitsap County native thought, What a fantastic place! Wouldn t it be great to raise the girls here? That summer opportunity knocked, and the Robocker family came to stay. With both girls enrolled in Chimacum, Tami quickly became a fixture at the school and in the community. Tami happily participated as a classroom volunteer, helped organize fall carnivals, coached Destination Imagination, worked in the PTA, and teamed with other parents in support of the Chimacum Band Boosters. She started a business in Hadlock that gave her further opportunity to get to know the community and give back to the area she proudly adopted as home.

Tami remained involved with the community, volunteering for such events as the Chimacum Arts & Craft Fair, and connecting with people at her place of business. Tami also remained committed to the success of Chimacum students, teachers, staff, and school board, and when opportunity knocked a second time she was happy for the chance to serve her community as part of the Chimacum School Board.

Kathryn Lamka A/P Voucher Reviewer Title: Director District #5 Elected: 2020 Term: 11/2021 - 11/2025 Email: k athryn_lamka@csd49.org Phone:(206) 931-0227 Kathryn Lamka grew up in Michigan and attended Michigan State University, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in German Education and a Master of Arts in Secondary Education. She taught German for ten years in the South Redford School District. When enrollments in the district declined, she was able to pursue another of her dreams-- working for IBM as a Systems Engineer. While in Detroit, she worked exclusively with General Motors. She accidentally found Seattle while on a business trip and began lobbying for a move to the Pacific Northwest. With IBM in Seattle, she supported many large companies and established a consultancy to introduce electronically supported meeting facilitation and decision making. After fifteen years at IBM, she left to continue the meeting facilitation using a software product developed by a startup company called Meetingworks. It was at this time that she felt like she had come full circle to combine her teaching skills with her technical skills. Each meeting involved creating a process to lead a group to a desired end, whether it be strategic planning, problem solving, team building, process improvement or project prioritization. Kathryn and husband Neil Lamka moved from Seattle to Port Ludlow in 2004, where she was able to conduct meetings remotely using their software. In 2010, she retired and joined the world of volunteering. She served on the board of the Jefferson Land Trust for eight years, as President of her local water district board for seven years, and as President of Jefferson Solar Group, a local group of solar enthusiasts who installed a large solar array at the Jefferson County Airport. In 2017, she joined the board of The Community Wellness Project (CWP), whose mission is to cultivate the health, resiliency and wellbeing of students and families in Jefferson County. The focus has been on Chimacum, where CWP has helped secure major grant funding for introducing Farm to School components such as school gardens at all levels, equipment upgrades for the cafeteria to process local foods, and CTE programming to broaden the scope of the Culinary Arts and Horticulture classes. For the past nine years, Kathryn has been tutoring in the Chimacum Elementary School, both in math and English/Language Arts. She is also a member of the Wellness Committee, a board appointed committee to implement the District s Wellness Policy. She is an avid spin cyclist and enjoys gardening, walking, cooking, and traveling. Kathryn joins the board with the hope that we can continue to shine a light on Chimacum s heritage and provide excellent opportunities and healthy options for all students in the District. Mike Aman WIAA Representative Title: Director District #2, Elected: 2021 Term: 11/2021 - 11/2025 Email: mike_aman@csd49.org Phone: (360) 531-0942 Mike Aman grew up in Jefferson County for 17 of his first 18 years. He started out in the Port Townsend school district but switched to Chimacum in sixth grade going on to graduate in 1987. A short stint in the US Army led him back home for good. Not long after that he embarked on the journey of fatherhood and his two kids were raised mostly here in Chimacum except for a few short years in Wisconsin with their mother. With his kids participating in many different extracurricular activities, he soon found himself involved quite heavily in the Chimacum school district. From being a band dad, a cheer dad, a choir dad and even a drama club dad; if the kids were there so was he. Mike has served on a number of boards in the community ranging from Chimacum Band Boosters Association, Big Blue Boosters, the Rhody Festival board and also a church board. He also spent over 20 years working with youth at a local church. He is relying on this bit of experience to help him as he endeavors to do his best to serve the kids of Chimacum. Mike has been working at Carl s Building Supply since 1999 and has a real knack for remembering peoples names over the years. His familiarity with so many residents of the East Jefferson County community is his baseline in connecting and encouraging families to be more involved in the Chimacum school district. One of his core values, Treat others the way you want to be treated is a character trait that is a positive ideal he shares wherever he goes.
