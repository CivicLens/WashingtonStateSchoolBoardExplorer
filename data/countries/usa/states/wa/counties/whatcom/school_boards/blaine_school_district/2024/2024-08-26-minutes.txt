  2. Work Session Content
A. District Strategic Plan
Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update on the district's 5-year Strategic Plan. He reviewed four main goal areas, starting with the success of Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), which have benefited from the Wednesday late-start schedule, allowing educators to meet regularly. A middle and high school literacy curriculum has been reviewed and adopted, with plans to evaluate the K-5 curriculum next. Fiscal responsibility was another key focus, with a capital projects bond proposal on the General Election ballot in November. Dr. Granger also emphasized the district's core values, particularly the importance of student voice in refining operations and fostering a culture where all students are encouraged to be thinkers and problem solvers.

The discussion highlighted the ongoing improvements in PLC work and the use of data to inform instruction. The district is transitioning from STAR to i-Ready assessments to better align with student achievement goals, with strong Tier 1 instruction as the standard for all students. An infographic on the state’s Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) was reviewed, showing how the district's initiatives align with state guidelines. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) was mentioned as a framework to ensure all students receive the support they need, and PLCs were described as professional groups that review data to address student needs and monitor progress.
  B. 2023-2024 End-of Year Reports & 2024-2025 School Improvement Plans
Campus administrators presented their 2023-2024 End-of-Year Reports and 2024-2025 School Improvement Plans (SIP). P-5 Principal Michelle McKeown focused on ensuring high-quality Tier 1 instruction across the Blaine Primary School and Blaine Elementary School buildings. She used a toolbox analogy to emphasize using the right instructional tools, noting that baseline data from STAR would need conversion to i-Ready for better alignment. Blaine Elementary School was identified as underperforming in the OSSI subgroup, and Ms. McKeown is working on understanding the causes of underperformance at BES. Clarification was provided about the misalignment between STAR and SBA assessments, with hopes that i-Ready will be a better fit.

The meeting included a discussion of attendance goals, aiming for a 10% increase. When asked why not aim higher, Ms. McKeown explained that incremental improvements help foster a sense of accomplishment. Director Galbraith expressed concerns over literacy performance, criticizing the Fountas & Pinnell (F&P) literacy curriculum as ineffective. He suggested removing it as a non-negotiable in the SIP and shared personal views on the importance of improving reading skills, especially given the statistic that 70% of prison inmates cannot read. Ms. McKeown acknowledged challenges with F&P, especially in certain areas like decoding and comprehension. A broader discussion followed about finding balance between phonics and whole language instruction, with Ms. McKeown stressing the need for a blended approach in reading education. She opined that the F&P curriculum has value but needs augmentation, which will be part of the upcoming literacy review.

At the middle school level, Principal Darren Benson shared updates on staff training and highlighted SBA score reviews for ELA and math. He pointed out that alignment with the myPerspectives curriculum from grades 6-12 has shown improved results. Technical issues during the assessment for 6th graders may have partially contributed to lower math scores, but extra math instruction for 8th graders led to significant improvement. Mr. Benson explained the MTSS framework, which supports students at different levels (Tier 1 for all, Tier 2 for those needing additional help, and Tier 3 for individualized support). A discussion ensued about identifying students with alternative learning needs, such as dyslexia, and how the school uses both assessments and parent input to address these issues.

Director Lazarus raised questions about how Blaine’s scores compare to state averages, noting that low scores might reflect a broader statewide issue. Mr. Benson explained that changes in state standards and assessment methods have led to challenges in meeting evolving benchmarks. The conversation also touched on the impact of cell phone use in middle and high schools, with concerns about how phone distractions might affect focus and academic performance.

At the high school level, Principal Beth Eide emphasized that SBA scores are just one snapshot of student performance and may not reflect real-world skill application, particularly in CTE programs. The meeting also covered action plans for writing, reading, and math, with a focus on teacher collaboration across content areas. Director Galbraith questioned the jump in reading performance from 8th to 10th grade, with Ms. Eide attributing it to students’ increased maturity and application of knowledge in real-life contexts.

Secondary Online Learning Principal Scott Ellis provided an update on the Blaine High School Virtual Learning (BHSVL) program, which was launched this year with 32 students. Many of these students have personal challenges that prevent them from attending in-person classes. The BHSVL asynchronous program is not a “diploma mill” but offers rigorous instruction that mirrors Blaine High School’s curriculum. Mr. Ellis expressed personal rejuvenation from his work in this program, starting with the development process last February. He highlighted the program’s role in keeping students engaged who might otherwise leave the district. The BHSVL program follows ALE requirements, and Mr. Ellis will provide a mid-year review at the work session in February.
