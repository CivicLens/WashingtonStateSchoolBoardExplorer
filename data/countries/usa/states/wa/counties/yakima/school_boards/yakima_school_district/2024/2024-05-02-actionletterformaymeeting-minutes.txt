Principal Kaplicky shared the culture and climate of Adams - they played Hispanic music in the

He shared they have implemented parent voice circles at Adams. He shared their recent field trip
with 100 parents and 100 students in the second grade together. Adam’s ELL student population
is at 468 and growing. They were the first cohort with Dual Language and are moving to third
grade next year. He noted that HWC reports share the trauma that occurred in our students each
day. These reports give them a chance to work with their siblings’ schools as well. They
implemented a parent circle to discuss culture and climate and brought them from an outlier
school to one of the best ratings in the district.
They have made huge gains in their school improvement plan with monthly meetings. They have
over 50 community partnerships to benefit the students, including YSD graduates who are

employees in Yakima now.
Director Rice thanked him and applauded him for the strides in SIP. VP Villanueva noted the
growth in the CEE survey data and appreciates the area of focus for the long-term gain with
"growing your own." She liked the energy and excitement. Director Beckett asked for an update

grow events like movie night.
