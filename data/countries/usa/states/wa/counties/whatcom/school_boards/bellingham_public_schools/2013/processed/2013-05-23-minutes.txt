No audience presented.
INFORMATION
Prior to the Board’s approval of the consent agenda, Dr. Greg Baker asked Assistant
Superintendent Ron Cowan to review details of the following consent agenda items relating to
the construction of Birchwood Elementary School. Mr. Cowan made the following comments:
 2.5 - Constructability Review Report: An independent consultant prepared the report. The
process involved reviewing design plans in the pre-construction phase to identify
potential obstacles so that errors, delays, and change orders and/or claims could be
avoided. As a result of this review, the design team revised portions of the drawings
where problems were identified, resulting in a clean set of plans for bidders.
 2.6 – Intent to Construct: One requirement for state construction assistance is for the
Board to formally declare its intent to construct Birchwood Elementary School. The
district will meet this requirement upon the Board’s adoption of Resolution 11-13.
 2.7 – Award of Bid: On May 21, 2013, the district reviewed bids from five general
contractors, and the recommendation is to award the General Construction Contract for
Birchwood Elementary School to the lowest responsible bidder, Colacurcio Brothers, Inc.
Mr. Cowan then responded to general questions from Board members.

Budget: Staff and community members have provided good feedback on the district’s
budget process. The legislature is now in special session; so there are no definitive
numbers yet relating to funding for the coming school year. The next Board meeting will
be a study session focused on the budget.
Facilities planning: Administrators have met with staff and parents to discuss facilities
planning for Parkview Elementary School. Discussion focused on the tradeoffs and
potential benefits of construction of a new school. Another meeting with all Parkview
families will take place on May 28.
In other matters pertaining to facilities planning, preliminary discussions are underway to
determine the feasibility of bringing in water, electricity, and other enhancements at
the Gordon Carter Environmental Site for possible inclusion in the upcoming bond.
Recommendations and additional details will be brought to the Board in June.
Dr. Baker also said that discussions are continuing regarding funding for Sehome High
School’s rebuild.
