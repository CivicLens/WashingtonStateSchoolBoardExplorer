2017 is not acceptable.

reach substantial completion by August 14, 2017.This will allow us to open the new school in the fall of
2017 as originally planned.
The attached change order represents the result of their efforts and the cost to accelerate the required
work in order to achieve the August 14, 2017 completion date.
Board approval of the attached change order is requested.
