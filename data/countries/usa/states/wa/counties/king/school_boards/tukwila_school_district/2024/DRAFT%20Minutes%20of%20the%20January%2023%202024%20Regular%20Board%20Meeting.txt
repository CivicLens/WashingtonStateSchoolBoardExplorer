5. Public Comment
A. Public Comment
President Hoover called for Public Comment.
Louis D'Andrea, SMS Staff - Addressed the Board regarding the current violent incidents in the community, and shared
information on data, and comments from staff and students from 2022 in support of an SRO (School Resource Officer). Staff feels
that there were a lot of incidents in the building that would not have happened if we had an SRO at our school. Our
administration is working hard, but we need more help. If we had an officer walking the halls and creating and cultivating
relationships, we feel it would help. We are doing everything we can to protect our students, but we don't have the resources
necessary.
Director Simpson asked for information on staff assaults. Dr. Pedroza will follow up with that information.
Erica Cieslikowski, SMS Staff - Addressed the Board regarding the need for an SRO. It's been over three (3)years of following a
process. Voices have been listened to, subsequent changes have been made to the SRO contract language in response to that
feedback. It is time to bring the SRO back. How do we build bridges between the police and the community if we keep putting
walls up and kicking police out? How do we foster positive relationships, empathy, and understanding yet strike a balance with
school safety? The most recent surveys that students have taken all point to one word. Most of our classroom charters and our
school charter start with our students wanting to feel safe. All of our students should feel safe using a restroom without being
assaulted. Parents, guardians, and caregivers should feel safe sending their children here every day without fear of violent
threats being made. If students knew there was an officer on campus, the violent incidents would be less. Please add this topic
to the agenda. Many of our staff and students fear for our safety.

6. Reports
A. Student Representatives Report
Jr. Representative Brewster shared information on the Student Advisory Committee. He reported on spreading awareness about
the Student Advisory Committee since some students still aren't aware of it and the deadline is coming up. To the teachers here,
please tell your students about the committee. It's Tell your students about the committee. Students on the committee are
part of the discussion and involved in the decision-making process directly and with the Superintendent present can give
feedback to the school board. Additionally, there are a lot of students complaining about safety, especially in restrooms, i.e
vaping devices.
Dr. Pedroza will send a link to the Board of Directors for the application, FAQ, and other information for the Student Advisory
Committee.
B. Superintendent Report
Dr. Pedroza reported on several items.
Student Advisory Committee - The principals have been doing announcements and we have advertised in the newsletters. We
have also received a suggestion that we go and visit the schools and some of the 5th-grade teachers. This is an opportunity for
us to hear from all of our students, not just high school students. We have visited schools and have done quite a bit of outreach
and we have several applicants. Once the committee is formed, the plan is to meet once a month, on Zoom.
Safety and Security - We have had two (2) major incidents. She shared that she is interested in examining the root causes, not
just from the root causes of the system, but also at the student level. What are things that are missing that we should be
thinking about in terms of community partnership, etc. Additionally, what are things that we can do better in the system as well.
She also acknowledged and thanked the staff and first responders. You are amazing, you have been there and acted
immediately which stops more people from being harmed.
We had three (3) buildings during January that had been damaged due to inclement weather. The most severe damage was the
District Administration building. It will be closed for at least two (2) months. She wanted to assure families that we are here and
located at the Business Service Center, located directly across from Foster High School. She thanked the community members
who came to help with packing, sorting, labeling, etc. All of you were amazing! We couldn't have done this without all of you.
Race and Equity - Due to the flood, we had to postpone the meetings. We are moving the meetings to February.
Health Update - The District is in the process of reviewing student exclusions based on vaccination requirements. We are
currently reaching out to providers who may be able to support our community in getting vaccinated because the last thing we
want to do is exclude any students from school. The formal provider we had closed. We are now working on a long-term
solution so that we can partner with vaccination clinics and epi-pens for our students.
Chief Financial Officer - Amy Fleming is our new Chief Financial Officer. Her first day was last Wednesday and after orientation,
she helped us pack up and sort through items.
Director Proctor commented that his daughter is the Director of Vaccinations at Odessa Brown Children's Clinic. She is in charge
of the mobile vaccination unit. This is for all vaccinations, not just COVID vaccinations.
C. Board of Directors Report
Director Simpson reported on working with Highline Community College for access for students to college after graduation. He is
excited that we are building the relationship again and having them come into the high school to talk with students.
President Hoover reported on having an opportunity to re-engage with the elevated youth voice of color and leadership. There
was a discussion on how we want to empower student voices to feel like they can come to our Board meeting and offer a
meaningful voice and use their voice to make decisions at the table. They reported on helping staff at the Administration building
with the packing of boxes and clean up. They gave a huge shout-out to the community for helping with packing and bringing
positive energy. We have an amazing community.
Director Proctor shared that he was excited to connect a liaison for vaccinations. He shared he is looking forward to reporting and
following through with the next steps.
Director Larson reported on an editorial in the Seattle Times which addressed the whole issue of the lack of equity in funding.
That particular editorial didn't come by accident because I and a former Board member sat down with Claudia Rowee who's on
the editorial staff of the Seattle Times. This is the first in a series of editorials that she will be doing on this issue, which is
helpful when we speak to legislators about the funding system. This first editorial used Tukwila as an example and referenced
some research work done by David Knight, who is a professor at the University of Washington. His research showed that Tukwila
is underfunded by approximately $5,000 per student which would translate to approximately $15 million more in funding for us.
Mr. Knight also published a policy brief from the University of Washington last month which was more in-depth and showed how
the funding system could be reformed, with specific reforms listed. The legislature is getting more interested in this. The House
Finance Committee had a whole session on education funding systems in the state and David Knight was there addressing the
committee about the funding system.
Director Larson reported on attending the WSSDA Legislative Committee and it seems that progress is being made. A few people
are getting convinced and coming on to this side and understand why this needs to be done and why it is fair, etc.

Director Larson shared that he watched our Levy Committee give a presentation at the City of Tukwila Council meeting. The
Council voted to support of our two (2) levies on the February ballot. A student from Foster High School gave a great poetry
reading of why the levy should be supported.
D. Legislative Update
Director Larson shared several items on the upcoming bills for discussion in the current short legislative session. There are
several bills that are being discussed. (Document of legislative bills attached).
Director Larson shared that the Superintendent and two (2) Student Representatives will be going to Olympia next Monday and
we will be talking with our local legislators about the funding dilemma we are in and all of the ways they could help mitigate that
for us.
7. Consent Agenda
A. Approval of Minutes from the December 12, 2023 Board Meeting
B. Approval of Warrants (General Fund, Capital Projects Fund, Associated Student Body Program Fund, Vouchers
and Debt Service payments) (REVIEWED BY DIRECTORS PROCTOR and LARSON)
Director Larson made a motion to approve the Consent Agenda.
Director Simpson seconded the motion.

The motion carried.
8. Board Discussion
There were no items for Board Discussion.
9. Questions Only - Presentations
A. Avid Report
Foster student Andy Mendoza shared how AVID helped him onto a better educational path. President Hoover asked if any other
programs were modeled like AVID with a smaller cost. Dr. Deno shared that any national program will have a cost. Erin Herda
shared that AVID is the one consistent program that we have for our students.
B. Report - Policy No. 3241 - Discipline Data
Director Larson commented that SWIS has more data than other programs and offers more options for disaggregation of data.
When we are looking at discipline data, we need to know where the referrals are happening. He shared he was looking for trends
in the data, however, with the COVID pandemic, it messed up trend data. We need to go back to pre-COVID, which when looking
at that data, it showed that out-of-school suspensions decreased significantly. Current data shows that out-of-school suspensions
have increased. What is the cause? Are we not implementing solutions as we did pre-COVID? There is also an increase in fights.
It would be nice to see a report as to what is behind these numbers for referrals, etc.
Director Proctor shared that he would like to know the root causes of the increased incidents. Director Proctor commented that
he would like to see the root cause report, along with what strategies are being used, training of staff, etc.
Mr. Christopher shared that Belong Partners has been working with our staff on behavior training, classroom strategies, and
practical solutions. Mr. Croyle shared that Belong Partners has been working in his school as well. In addition to the previous
strategies mentioned, Belong Partners also works with our MTSS team, which includes PBIS and RULER. We have been working
on our school-wide discipline plan making sure that we have clear language, and what that looks like. This is also linked to our
discipline referral. We look at discipline as learning opportunities, not as discipline. This helps prepare students for the next step
in their education.
Director Hoover shared that the definition of discipline is to teach. They commented that we need to get common definitions of
what we mean by inappropriate behavior. This is where the most bias is going to come, particularly against your black boys.
also, what specific professional development or discussions and reflective opportunities on understanding biased inherent
discipline? If we don't do that, these numbers will not change.
C. MTSS Report - District and Schools
D. Enrollment Report - December 2023 & January 2024
Director Larson requested that the Free and Reduced lunch percentage be included on the enrollment reports. This funding is
critical for our district. Over the years, he has noticed that there are different numbers between what we are reporting as
compared to what OSPI is reporting. Mr. Woodard shared that there is a monthly report that has been shared with the Board.
Ms. Kohr will share the reports with the Board.
E. Monthly Budget Status Report – November & December 2023
Director Larson asked if we are in binding conditions. Greg Woodard shared that yes, we are in binding conditions, which happens
automatically when we end with a negative fund balance.

Director Larson asked for an explanation of what capacity is, which would be helpful for our new Board Directors. Mr. Woodard
shared that for school districts capacity equates to contingency, i.e. for expenses that are incurred unexpectedly.
Director Larson commented on the Athletic stipends. Were these not budgeted? Mr. Woodard shared that the stipends were not
fully budgeted. Director Simpson asked how do we prevent this from happening again. Mr. Woodard shared that last year, this
was not included in the budget process. This will be part of the budget process this year. The payroll system that we currently,
have through the state is very clunky. This is not unique to Tukwila as all districts have this system. The only way to prevent
this from continuing to happen is the diligence of the CFO and HR.
