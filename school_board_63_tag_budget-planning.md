The Blaine School District No. 503 held a special board meeting on January 11, 2024, focused on budget planning for the 2024-2025 fiscal year. Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter presented an overview of the district's budget development process, including the impact of McCleary restrictions on local levy collections and the necessity of maintaining a consistent tax rate for property owners. The board discussed the need for a reduced education plan due to anticipated budget shortfalls, with a projected reduction of $2.7 million needed, contingent on the passage of the EP&O levy in the upcoming February 2024 special election. 

Porter emphasized the importance of compliance with state law regarding budget projections and outlined the district's policy to end the year with a fund balance of at least 6% of expenditures. The meeting also addressed the implications of federal ESSER funds on the district's financial health and staffing expenses. Additionally, there were discussions about the impact of legislative changes on funding and the district's approach to special education support, highlighting the challenges faced due to declining enrollment and increased staffing costs. The board was encouraged to engage with district leadership for ongoing communication regarding budget considerations.
