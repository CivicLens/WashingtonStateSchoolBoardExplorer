Public Comment Guidelines

We welcome your comments. It is important that members of the public understand how public
participation at Board meetings will occur.
Purpose of Board Meetings:
Regularly scheduled Board meetings are meetings of the Board to facilitate discussion between board
members, the superintendent, and the superintendents designees. While the Board meetings are held in
public, they are different than community hearings or public forums, and they limit public participation to
the public comment section of the agenda.
The opportunity for public to comment on specific items will appear on the Board agenda. For
matters not directly related to the work of the Board or items on the agenda, please contact the
Superintendent.
Comments are limited to 3 minutes per person. Public comment is not a formal or extended
presentation to the Board. Please refrain from making comments about any specific Staff member
by name. If the presenter would like the Board to have more information, written comments can be
submitted to the Executive Secretary or Superintendent designee.
The Board will not enter into dialogue with community members during the comment period. It is an
opportunity for the Board to hear from community members, but not to enter into policy or program
discussions. For matters of the day-to-day operation of the district such as policy, curriculum,
academic standards, etc., the public is invited and encouraged to contact the Superintendent
directly.
The School Board Chair may interrupt and/or terminate an individual's statement when it is too lengthy, personally directed,
abusive, obscene or irrelevant. The Chair may adjourn the meeting at any time if decorum is not maintained during a public
comment session.
