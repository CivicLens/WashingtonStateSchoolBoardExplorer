Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, and Kurt
Gazow, Executive Director of Technology
Explanation of Issue:
Bellingham Public Schoolsuses Skyward to manage the student information, fiscal, human resources and
state reporting needs. This software is heavily integrated into our day-to-day operations and is crucial to
key operations.
Hosted by the Washington Schools Information Processing Cooperative, or WSIPC, Skyward is used by
266 public school districts and 25 private schools/consortia throughout the state through several interlocal
cooperatives, predominantly operated by Educational Service Districts.
Last year, we noted a few items in the contract and the linked agreements between WSIPC, our ESD,
Northwest Regional Data Center (NWRDC) and Bellingham Public Schools that we believe need followup. These range from clarifying the security of the database, documenting their procedures to protect
against cybercrime, emergency recovery procedures, inconsistent termination date and fee language,
and revised contract delivery deadlines. We have worked directly with WSIPC to address data security
concerns and agreed in principal to an addendum to the contract to further define and clarify associated
requirements, and have attached it for your reference. We will continue to work with our ESD to further
clarify term and renewal guidelines associated with the agreement.

In the meantime, we request board approval of our continued use of the Skyward system and renewal of
this contract.
