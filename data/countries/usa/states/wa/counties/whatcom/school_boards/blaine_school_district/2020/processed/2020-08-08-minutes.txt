     Todd Nunamaker, Dougal Thomas, Joan Lotze, Charles E Gibson, Laura McKinney

Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger indicated that emails received from patrons were reviewed by directors individually prior to the meeting. He thanked those directors who attended the Community Q&A on August 6, and expressed his appreciation for the community members who participated.

Dr. Granger repeated his recommendation to open the 2020-2021 school year remotely with the intent to incrementally phase in students' return to buildings. He reiterated that this possibility is dependent upon all adult behaviors being strictly in support of modeling the social distancing procedures expected for students when they return to campus.
  2. Action Items
A. Resolution 1920-16 Adopt Revised Reopening Plan
The board discussed community input received regarding the revised plan to start the 2020-2021 school year in a remote learning model.
  Director Thomas thanked the community for reaching out via email as well as participating in the Community Q&A. He indicated that the community is as torn as he is between the need for students to be in front of teachers and the need to consider the health and well-being of staff.

Director McKinney thanked Dr. Granger for the incredible amount of work he has done in analyzing and balancing input from all sources. There is no disputing that educators are essential for the district's operation. She believes it is the board's responsibility to set the district's vision and then allow the superintendent and leadership team to work towards that goal. She stated the goal is to bring students back to their classrooms, and she commented on factors in place that give her confidence that schools could operate safely in a hybrid model. Director McKinney asserted that the Health Department's recommendation for remote learning is not a mandate. She disagrees with starting remotely when case statistics in the Blaine community meet the moderate threshold, and she does not agree with basing the decision on future projections. She clarified that her disagreement is an indication of her confidence in Dr. Granger's plan for a hybrid model, and she believes that the district has the ability to open successfully with an immediate phase-in rather than 100% remote.

President Gibson commented on the needs of young children in particular and the detrimental impact on them for years to come by missing out on being in school. He feels strongly that the recommendation to phase in the return of students is critical. He also commented on liability concerns stemming from information provided by the Washington Schools Risk Management Pool.

Director Nunamaker indicated that his opinion has vacillated hourly on this issue, and he continues to feel torn.

Director Lotze shared concern related to reports from other parts of the country where schools have reopened and then had to shut down again. She would prefer to reopen cautiously and move ahead slowly, because shutting down again would be yet another disruption.

Dr. Granger believes that adults can provide a positive example to students of how to remain united in support of both teachers and students despite having different opinions. He reiterated the importance of staff modeling the same social distancing behavior expected for students which will be mandatory.

Director McKinney asked for clarification of the timeline for phasing in the return of students. Dr. Granger clarified that a specific timeline cannot be provided due to the ever-changing circumstances, and each phase would need no less than three to four weeks. Discussion continued regarding the logistics of a remote learning model, including matters related to attendance. Director McKinney asked twice if the hybrid model is even still an option at this time. Dr. Granger provided multiple reasons why it is not feasible, including concerns about staffing. Claims that this is a local decision do not account for expectations imposed by the Health Department, Labor & Industries, and labor unions. He assured the board that starting the year in a remote model does not mean that efforts to bring students back to their classrooms will stop.

Director Lotze shared comments regarding spread of COVID-19 in the community which is tied to large gatherings and noncompliance with social distancing guidelines. Dr. Granger affirmed this and reiterated his intent to enforce compliant behaviors from staff. President Gibson agreed on the importance of community members following basic guidelines so that local case statistics will go down.

At Director McKinney's request, Dr. Granger read aloud the updated area of the proposed resolution. All agreed that this decision is incredibly difficult. Dr. Granger indicated that the board could table the issue again if desired, but the district's plan must be provided to OSPI and SBE no later than Wednesday, August 12.
  The board proceeded with a vote, and adopted Resolution 1920-16 regarding the district's revised reopening plan for the 2020-2021 school year.
