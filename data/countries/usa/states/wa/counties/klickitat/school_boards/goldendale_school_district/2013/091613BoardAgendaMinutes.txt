Information:

None.

Principal Reports:

Mr. Henry, Principal at Goldendale High School reported that it was a great start of this school
year; the juniors and seniors are participating in the Collection of Evidence Math testing now; the
athletic teams have begun their competitions; student dress code issues are approximately two
per day so the majority of students are honoring the new requirements.
Mr. Barta, Principal at Goldendale Middle School reported that the teachers are quite excited to
have the students back and they are helping to enforce the dress code by talking with their
students. Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Wanderscheid had a great turn out for their WEB orientation
where the eighth grade students help with the fifth grade orientation. Open house was held in
the gym and had a good attendance even though it was fairly hot that evening.
Mr. Ferrell, Principal at Goldendale Primary School reported enjoyed the kick-off to the new
school year. The micro-society that has been in place will be continued this year as the children
really enjoy that program and it will begin October 1st. Mr. Ferrell enjoys seeing the high school
students he had last year when they arrive at the primary school for their HOSTS or TA periods.
Mr. Ferrell expressed his appreciation for the staff assistance to quickly get the school year
underway due to the last minute of a principal transition. MAP testing will begin next week.
Mr. Den Boer, Vice-Principal/Activities Director at Goldendale High School noted that he was
excited for the opportunity to advance his career into administration and to work with the
excellent administrative team and school board. He noted that 9 students are participating in
cheer, 13 in cross country, 12 in soccer, 56 in football, 22 in volleyball and 41 in pep band. He
noted that if soccer does not have a minimum of eleven players, they will forfeit the game as it is
not safe or competitive to play with less players than that.

Board Comments:

Mrs. Amidon noted that it was good to be a part of the School Board.
Ms. Heart noted that she has received comments about how nice it was that Thaynan Knowlton
(former primary school principal), is now the Superintendent at the Kettle Falls School District;
she also noted how good the guest speaker was for the back to school staff meeting and felt it
set the tone for a good school year; she thanked the staff responsible for assisting the Relay For
Life event held recently on school grounds.
Mr. Conroy noted how appreciative and lucky our school district was to have such high quality
staff to be able to reassign people at the last moment into key positions; he noted that Jim Allyn
of Allyn’s Building Supply made significant donations to the stadium upgrade project and he,
along with the Kiwanis Club members should be thanked for their services. Mr. Conroy requested
that the Board schedule a meeting to become more knowledgeable with the legal obligations for
Directors and he also asked for a workshop on how to become a better school board member.
Mr. Heid will make arrangements for this.
Mr. Hoctor noted that it was good to benefit from the funding received and for the projects that
were able to be completed.

WSSDA/Leg. Report:

School Board Meeting
Page | 2

Ms. Heart encouraged the Board to attend the Legislative Assembly coming up this weekend as it
provided an opportunity to network with like-size districts. There is a regional WSSDA meeting to
be held on October 9 in Sunnyside to learn about the Common Core Curriculum beginning at 4:00
p.m. and dinner at 6:00 p.m. Mr. Heid noted that there is also an ESD 105 Legislative dinner
event on October 16 from 6-8:30 p.m. in Yakima. Please let Lori know who would like to attend
each event.

Superintendent’s Report:

Mr. Heid reported that enrollment is currently at 929.79 fte and the budget was built on 900 fte.
Mr. Heid said Thaynan Knowlton asked him to convey to the Board of Directors how much he
treasured his years with the Goldendale School District and he appreciated the opportunity at
the late moment to advance his career with his relocation to the Kettle Falls School District.
Mr. Heid noted that the opening day of school was quite good although additional enrollment in
special education has the classroom teachers very busy to meet student needs. Volleyball will
have home games the Tuesday and Thursday and Mr. Heid invited everyone to attend some of
the many ongoing activities that involve our students.
Mr. Conroy noted that he would like to see information on our school bus and maintenance
department fleets next month.
