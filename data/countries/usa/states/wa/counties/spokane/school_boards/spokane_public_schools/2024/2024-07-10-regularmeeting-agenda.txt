Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation:
Approve issuance of a purchase orderto Terrys Dairy, Inc., Colville, WA, for milk and dairy product needs during the 2024-2025
fiscal year and 2025 summer feeding program. The estimated cost of these products is $1,300,000.00.

Background:
This renewal contract provides milk and dairy products for consumption in the school nutrition programs for the upcoming 20242025 fiscal year. There are two group designations: Group 1 is fluid milk in individual gabled cartons and Group 2 consists of
other miscellaneous dairy products. The pricing on Group 2 items will remain relatively static during the contract year, however,
the contract terms for Group 1 items allows for price adjustments (both increases and decreases) based upon prevailing market
conditions as published in the Federal Milk Administrator. Therefore, the prices for fluid milk are subject to escalation or deescalation throughout the year at a rate consistent with established federal formulas. While the recommended bid award dollar
amount is based on pricing submitted from historical sales, it is recommended that the board also approve an amount of 10%
over that figure in light of uncertain enrollment growth of our student population and their participation in the meal programs.

This recommended contract accesses the first of four one-year renewal options as provided in the bid specifications. The
expenditures for this contract will come from the general fund.

Recommendation:
Approve issuance of a purchase order in the estimated amount of $307,000 to Coleman Oil Co., Lewiston, ID, for approximately
60,000 gallons of unleaded gasoline and 10,000 gallons of diesel fuel to provide the districts fuel needs for the 2024-2025 fiscal
year.

Background:
This recommendation provides for the purchase of unleaded fuel, 87.0 octane level, and diesel fuel for district use during the 202
4-2025 fiscal year. All fuels will be consumed by the district's vehicle fleet and equipment. Annually, the district uses
approximately 60,000 gallons of unleaded gasoline and 10,000 gallons of diesel fuel. Due to wide pricing swings for this
commodity, it is difficult to accurately predict the dollar amount needed for the upcoming year. Prices are subject to increases
/decreases as the daily average OPIS pricing index fluctuates while the delivery fee of $250 per delivery shall remain constant
during the term of this recommended contract. If prices were to remain static, this would equate to approximately $270,000 for
the year. It is further recommended that the board approve a 10% contingency amount in the event that the district fuel usage
exceeds the anticipated amount referenced above. The recommended purchase order price amount reflects the added 10%
contingency allowance for the pricing and volume fluctuations. The expenditure for these products will be from the general fund.

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order to Pape Machinery, Inc. Spokane, WA, in the amount of $138,549.00 for a John Deere Compact
Front Loader.

Background:
As part of the district's strategic planning process for capital equipment acquisition and replacement, this purchase is to replace a
front loader in the maintenance department fleet. The loader scheduled to be replaced is over 40 years old and has reached the
end of its useful life. Parts have also become inaccessible and obsolete. The new loaders primary use will be to assist in daily
duties of grounds maintenance, as well snow removal in the winter.
This recommended purchase is accessing Sourcewell contract no. 011723-JDC. The contract allows for a 26% discount and the
district is receiving a deeper discount of 33.5% given the recommended loader is a new 2022 model. The pricing is considered
fair and reasonable and is a general fund expenditure.

Recommendation:
Approve issuance of purchase orders to Lakeshore Learning Materials, Carson, CA for the amount of $184,391.65 for preschool
classroom furniture and supplies.
Background:
As the district expands PreK and establishes a 4-year-old program in each of the elementary schools, preschool furniture and
materials must be purchased to ensure each classroom has what is needed for the 2024-25 school year. The district has
partnered with Lakeshore Learning for many years outfitting our preschool programs. This will maintain consistency throughout
the preschool classrooms. Lakeshore also offers on-site delivery and set-up service for the district at no additional cost, which
will save the district additional costs for staff time.
In keeping with the bid law, RCW 28A.335.190, these contracts resulted from competitive bids that were awarded to the low
responsive and responsible bidder. The recommended purchases will be funded by ECEAP and Transition to Kindergarten state
funds.

Public Content
Recommendation:
Approve issuance of a purchase order to Cengage Learning of Independence, KY through the Northwest
Textbook Depository of Lake Oswego, OR, in an amount not to exceed $170,000.00 plus sales tax for
materials needed due to an expanding need for the Newcome/ELD program in the 2024-2025 school year.
Background:

The ELD department went through an adoption process and selected Cengage Learning for supplemental
ELD materials to support language acquisition for multilingual learners (MLs) in K-12th grade.Based on
increased enrollment, critical needs have been identified.
1) Consumable Materials Replacement
Need to replace adopted consumable materials such as In the USA and Inside the USA used in the
district's Newcomer centers. These materials are essential for developing foundational literacy and
communication skills in English for MLs. The current increase in student population necessitates
replenishing these materials to ensure equitable access.
2)Additional Student Books
Due to a significant increase in ML student enrollment over the past two years, additional adopted student
books are required for Inside and Edge programs at middle and high school levels. These books are crucial
for providing necessary support and resources to the expanding ML population.
3) Online Digital Tool
Need to renew myNGconnect licenses, an interactive digital platform designed to support student learning
and engagement in the ELD curriculum. This offers a comprehensive suite of tools including an
interactive student book, multimedia resources, and assessments that cater specifically to the needs of ML
students.
The purchase of these materials directly supports the district's commitment to enhancing language
acquisition and educational outcomes for all ML students. By ensuring access to up-to-date resources, we
can effectively meet the diverse learning needs of our student population.
The expenditure will be paid from the general fund.

$115,770.52

Background:
The district purchases approximately $300,000 of non-food consumables annually that are stocked in the warehouse and
supplied to schools as needed. In order obtain the best possible pricing, a solicitation is issued every 3-4 months. Given the total
expenditure for the product requires a bid, each purchase will be solicited as a formal bid. The Purchasing office utilizes an
electronic solicitation system, allowing for efficient solicitation and tabulation making more frequent solicitations possible.
This bid includes items for use by Nutrition Services for food preparation and serving, such as plastic bags, foil, cups, boats, and
utensils. Due to current economic times, paper products, such as paper boats and bowls, which are the majority of these items,
are subject to availability. Also, pricing is subject to manufacturer increase. Any price increase will be verified by written notice
from the mill.
All recommended awards are to the low responsible bidder offering acceptable products. In the event that products identified are
determined unacceptable for district use or the vendor is unable to provide the product as bid, it is further recommended that
authorization be granted to proceed to the next low bidder(s) and award to that bidder whose product fully meets acceptance
criteria. Actual purchase orders may be adjusted slightly to accommodate specific product packaging quantities.

Recommendation:
It is recommended that the Board No Award Bid No. 24-2324 for a Used Dump Truck. It is further recommended, that a purchase
order be issued to Selectrucks of Memphis, Memphis, TN for the amount of $124,700 for a used dump truck.
Background:
As part of the district's strategic planning process for acquiring and replacing capital equipment, a need for a dump truck was
identified. This equipment is essential for everyday operations as the district currently lacks a vehicle with a high enough gross
vehicle rating to tow heavy equipment such as the front loader, backhoe, and tractors without violating legal weight restrictions.
The primary use of the new dump truck will be to assist maintenance in their daily duties, including pulling heavy equipment,
maintaining the district grounds, and snow removal in the winter.
Given the cost, the district published a solicitation for a used dump truck instead of purchasing new. The solicitation was
advertised and posted through Public Purchase. The district received no responses; therefore, it is recommended the Board No
Award Bid No. 24-2324 for a Used Dump Truck.
Following no responses to the bid, it was deemed in the best interest of the district to connect with heavy equipment vendors
directly to explore viable options given there is a market shortage of used dumps trucks. A suitable solution was identified, and it
is recommended that this purchase be approved.Pricing is considered fair and reasonable. This purchase will be a general fund
expenditure.

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order to Tuff Shed, Spokane, WA in the amount of $224,600.60 for 10x12 sheds
Background:
This recommended purchase is for (34) 10x12 sheds for each elementary school. These sheds are needed to provide additional
storage space for early childhood educational materials and recreational outdoor interactive play equipment. Outdoor activities
are considered educational in early childhood and this equipment cannot be mixed with the district's other programs at the
elementary school level. The current play toys are not age-appropriate for the districts early learners so this will allow the district
to purchase and safely store appropriate outdoor gross motor play equipment for 3 and 4-year-old students. Acquiring these
sheds will ensure that the program's materials and equipment are kept separately.

This recommended purchase will funded by ECEAP and Transition to Kindergarten state funds, and the pricing is deemed fair
and reasonable.

Recommendation:
Approve issuance of a purchase order to United States Bakery dba Franz Family Bakeries, Spokane, WA, for bakery product
items delivered directly to each school site in the anticipated amount of $325,000 for the 2024-2025 school year and 2025
summer feeding program.

Background:

Bakery items incorporated in this recommendation are to support the Nutrition Services school meal and ala carte programs.
This recommended award is for bread products to be delivered directly to each district school site. The district received bids from
the two vendors who participated in the summer 2023 solicitation: US Foods (formerly Food Services of America) and United
States Bakery (locally known as Franz Family Bakeries), with Franz being the low responsible bidder. As such, it was
recommended the bid be awarded to Franz. The districts nutrition program had been receiving Franz bakery products delivered
through US Foods (Food Services of America prior to being bought by US Foods in 2020) for the past fifteen years. US Foods
has acted as a distributor of Franz, however, by purchasing directly through Franz, the district eliminates one layer of distribution
costs. Also, by not sending the bread items through our warehouse, products received at each site are fresher since there is no
time delay caused by the middle man method of distribution; this also frees up central warehouse freezer space. This
recommendation is the first of four optional renewals as allowed for in the Bid specifications. The districts nutrition program at
each site has been receiving bakery product deliveries directly from Franz for the past year, and after an initial learning curve,
has become a good business partner. Expenditures in support of the Nutrition Services meal programs are from the general fund.

Recommendation:
Approve issuance of a Purchase Order to JTM Provisions Co, Inc., Harrison, OH, in the estimated amount of $240,000, for beef
products processed with USDA beef commodities during the 2024-25 fiscal year per the terms and conditions of RFP No. 152122.

Background:
This recommendation is designed for the district to partner with a USDA-approved beef processor who can take the districts bulk
beef allotment and make it into patties, taco crumbles and other finished beef products with emphasis on using 100% beef
without added fillers. The district utilized the Request for Proposal soliciting style; this allowed other product and company
aspects besides cost to be considered when determining award. This process involved student product taste testing, back-ofkitchen scoring and reference checks conducted on the eligible USDA beef processors. Of the three USDA-approved beef
processors who responded, only two carried a full line of beef products utilized by the district. JTM Provisions Co., Inc. received

the most points in the overall evaluation and received the initial bid award. This will be the second of four optional annual renewal
s as allowed for in the RFP terms and conditions. The district has contracted with JTM for the past twelve years and finds their
product and service acceptable. Expenditures from this purchase will be from the general fund.

Background:
This recommendation is designed for the district to partner with a USDA-approved chicken processor who receives the districts
bulk chicken allotment at their facility and makes it into finished chicken products, with emphasis on producing whole muscle
products. The district utilized the Request for Proposal soliciting style; this allowed other product and company aspects besides
cost to be considered when determining award. This process involved student taste testing, back-of-kitchen scoring and
reference checks conducted on the eligible USDA chicken processors. Two USDA-approved chicken processors submitted
pricing, Pilgrims Pride Corporation and Tysons. Ultimately, Pilgrims Pride Corporation was determined the successful
respondent. This will be the second of four optional annual renewals. The district has contracted with Pilgrims Pride for the past
twelve years and finds their product and service acceptable. Expenditures from this purchase will be from the general fund.

Recommendation:
Award contractsto Dorian Studio, Herff Jones Yearbooks and Walsworth Publishing Co., all of Spokane, Washington, in the base
book amounts of approximately $125,000, $15,000 and $98,000 respectively.

Background:
This solicitation utilized a Request for Proposal (RFP) format as opposed to the bid method. With a bid, whoever submits the
lowest pricing is the awarded vendor. However, using the bidding method does not allow for subjective factors such as service,
book quality, deadlines imposed, etc., to be considered. The success of each schools yearbook production is dependent upon
the district advisors ability to work with the awarded companys representative; and, in turn, the representatives ability to relate
with the students. By issuing this type of solicitation, subjective factors are taken into consideration during the evaluation
process. A point value system was established and printed in the ensuing RFP for the subjective portions of the evaluation. After
compiling all the hard numbers to each evaluation criteria, the responsive vendor with the highest overall points was awarded
that particular schools yearbook.

This RFP contains provisions for annual renewals provided the best interests of the district continue to be served, up to four
optional renewal years; this is the second of four renewal options. While the initial pricing of each schools yearbook indicates the
lowest base pricing submitted by vendors, the actual final price for each schools book may increase depending on their choice to
include any additional optional extras such as upgraded covers, fancier end sheets or even increasing the total number of pages.
Recommended award is to those vendors who scored highest for each respective school during the initial phase of evaluation.
The district has had successful relationships with Dorians, Varsity and Walsworth. All related expenditures from this solicitation
are incorporated into the price students pay for their personal yearbook.
