Public Content
Ordinance 10-23 directs that 50% of retail sales tax revenue collected each quarter (less sales
tax derived from construction activities) in excess of $594,135 be placed in the Restricted CIP
Reserve Fund to be used for capital improvement projects.
Ordinance 12-10 further requires the Finance Director to submit a Quarterly Report of the Citys
retail sales tax revenue collections and financial condition. This provides the City Council an
opportunity to revise the percentage placed into the Restricted CIP Revenue Fund.
The 2024Q2 report attached indicates that the transfer amount by ordinance would be $307,941.
For comparison, the 2023Q2 period amount was $395,359. The year-over-year decrease of
$87,419 is the result of decreased overall sales tax revenue.

Recommended Action :

Move to adopt Resolution No. R-49-24 authorizing the
execution of a Fifth Amendment to the Interlocal
Governmental Agreement between the City of Pullman and
Washington State University relating to the proration of
capital and operating costs of the Pullman Wastewater
Treatment Plant.

Public Content
BACKGROUND ANALYSIS:
The City and WSU have separate sanitary sewer collection systems.
However, WSUs sewage is conveyed through certain City sanitary
sewer lines and is ultimately treated at the Citys wastewater treatment
plant.In 2001, the City executed an Interlocal Agreement with
Washington State University (WSU) relating to the proration of capital
and operating costs of the Pullman Wastewater Treatment Plant. The
term of the agreement was twenty years, and it was set to expire on
June 30, 2020. City and WSU staff initiated discussions in 2019
regarding developing a new Interlocal Agreement and mutually agreed
that a flow and loadings study was appropriate to determine the flow

and loads from the WSU system to the City system and determine a
new proration percentage. As such, an engineering services agreement
was approved by the Council at their 10/29/2019 (via R-76-19) meeting
to proceed with the flow and loading study in the spring and summer of
2020, with an understanding that the 2001 agreement would need to be
extended one year since the study would extend past June 30, 2020.
The flow and loading study was significantly impacted by COVID-19 as
the pandemic hit the region during the spring sampling period in 2020.
The summer sampling period was then delayed from 2020 to 2021 to try
and avoid the effects on flows and loads resulting from the pandemic.
However, after a review of the flow and loading study results, both City
and WSU staff surmised that the results of the study were still being
affected by the pandemic (dorm occupancy rates have not returned to
pre-pandemic figures) and not reflective of typical WSU contributions to
the sewer system. Thus, the City and WSU agree that additional data is
necessary to finalize the flow and loading study to determine the
appropriate WSU contribution to be used to develop a new Interlocal
Agreement, which is envisioned to include a 20-year term.
Additional data will be collected when both City and WSU staff agree
that WSU enrollment and dorm occupancy rates have stabilized back to
pre-pandemic figures. City and WSU staff met this month and evaluated
that close to normal (pre-pandemic figures) conditions will likely exist on
the WSU campus in the fall 2024 semester and that it is now
appropriate to collect additional data in the fall of 2024 and spring of
2025. Once new data is collected and the flow and loadings study is
complete, a new Interlocal Agreement will be drafted and brought to the
Council at a future date for action. However, if the collection of data is
delayed past the spring of 2025, then another one-year extension of the
existing Interlocal Agreement will be prepared and brought to the
Council next year at this time with appropriate justification.
In order to allow time for additional data collection to be completed and
a new agreement developed, WSU and City staff have agreed that
extending the existing agreement for an additional year to June 30,
2025, via Amendment No. 5, is appropriate. Amendment No. 1
extended the date of the Interlocal Agreement with WSU by one year to
June 30, 2021. Amendment No. 2 extended the date another additional

year to June 30, 2022, Amendment No. 3 extended the date to June 30,
2023, and Amendment No. 4 extended the date to June 30, 2024.
OPTIONS
1. Adopt

the Resolution authorizing the execution of a Fifth
Amendment to the Interlocal Governmental Agreement between
the City of Pullman and Washington State University relating to the
proration of capital and operating costs of the Pullman Wastewater
Treatment Plant.
2. Do not adopt the Resolution and provide alternative direction to
staff.

New Utility Fee Revenue to Offset Unanticipated
Expenses of Biosolids Hauling

Recommended Action :

Staff recommends adopting RESOLUTION R-50-24 - A
RESOLUTION CREATING A FEE FOR HAULING OF
BIOSOLIDS TO UTILITY CONSUMERS AND OTHER
MATTERS RELATED THERETO.

Public Content
Due to actions with the Washington Pollution Control Hearings
Board (PCHB) and associated activities by the Washington
State Department of Ecology (DOE) as a result, the City of
Pullman cannot at this time land apply biosolids as per past
practices - further making future activities unclear. Unlike
September 2023, a State of Emergency does not exist and a
contingency plan is in place that is prepared to be activated.
As part of this contingency plan, the only option left to the City
of Pullman Sewer Utility consumers is to haul these biosolids to
composting facilities in Lewiston ID and Airway Heights WA for
further treatment and final disposal. The yearly costs are
expected to be approximately $300,000 which is not budgeted.
This Resolution is presented recommending that City Council
adopt a Temporary Biosolids Fee to sewer utility consumers to
account for these unanticipated expenses and have the fee
remain in place beginning with activities starting August 1, 2024
until further clarification from the State Department of Ecology is
provided.

Washington State University (WSU) is a ratepayer and as per
the existing contract, 36.4% of this expense will be attributable
to those operations. As such, additional language is included in
the resolution to codify this expense.
The proposed fees for other consumers are:
Monthly Base Fee

Monthly Fee per
CCF

Small Commercial Meters

$ 2.97

$ 0.048

Larger Commercial Meters
( 1.5)

Multi Family

$ 4.46

$ 0.048

Duplex

Account Type

The timing of this resolution is directly related to city staff
working with the State Department of Ecologyto exhaust every
possible alternative for a more equitable solution before having
to move forward with the contingency plan and ensure that the
Biosolids Lagoon is emptied before winter weather sets in and
complicates hauling activities as well as the capacity
considerations at both facilities in the near-term.
