Presentation: A. Indicator 2A Students feel their schools are safe, welcoming, and challenging
Nick Bontrager presented on two indicators--2A Students feel their schools are safe, welcoming, and challenging. 3B Students participate in community experiences and civic activities.
Mr. Bontrager shared results from The Center of Educational Effectiveness Survey. It is a yearly survey for students, staff and families.
When looking at data, we want to think about: What is there to celebrate? What questions do we have? What action will we take based on this data? He noted results of how students feel concerning safety, feeling welcomed and being challenged, at grade school, middle school, and high school level. He also shared results of survey takers community experiences and civic activities.
Ms. Breitenstein asked which grades participated in the elementary group. Mr. Bontrager noted fourth and fifth grade students.
Ms. Jensen asked how often these surveys are sent out and in what format. Mr. Bontrager stated it is encouraged yearly and it was sent electronically to the survey takers'.
Mr. Bontrager noted when this information is given to the schools, they often implement it into their school improvement plans, etc.
The survey has been used for several years now and the district has some longitudinal data at this point.
Miss Michie, student board rep, asked where the district has seen the most improvement in the longitudinal data and where it has decreased. Mr. Bontrager noted an increase in "willingness to be held accountable" in the staff survey, which should affect "willingness to improve or change."
  Information: B. Indicator 3B Students participate in community experiences and civic activities
Included in 7A.
  Information, Presentation: C. Counselor Presentation on Bullying Prevention
Ms. Lewis asked the three counseling team leads to share a general overview of what we are doing in our district to prevent and address bullying issues.
Ms. Cardwell noted the elementary schools provide training and prevention education for their students. The Second Step Program is age-appropriate lessons for each grade level to teach and guide student conversations as well as information to promote student engagement. The program also has a social emotional piece taught by the teachers, but the counselors teach the bullying prevention lessons. Positive behavior is acknowledged and rewarded.
Mr. Mason noted all counselors employed by the MLSD care deeply about this topic of bullying prevention and work hard each day to improve the climate of their buildings. We begin with students in fifth grade by building relationships as we prepare them for middle school. When they come into sixth grade they are taught "survival". This is where we educate the students on bullying, how to report it, who their counselors are, confidentiality, emergencies and what to do, etc. In seventh grade we cover signs of suicide and prevention.  They also take a brief screening for adolescent depression. In eighth grade, students have social emotional lessons in their Advisory classes. Mr. Mason noted his motivation to get a therapy dog was prevention. He expressed his appreciation to the Board for inviting the counselors to present.
Enrique Tarver reminded the Board that Digital, Vanguard and MLHS are three very unique schools. The counselors do peer groups and digital citizenship lessons. Students are taught the importance of positive interaction with others, both in person and digitally. Vanguard uses community building circles at the beginning and end of the day where Character Strong curriculum is implemented, along with many other effective programs.
Mr. Tarver mentioned that SROs and administration are highly visible at MLHS and it has been very helpful.
Ms. Breitenstein asked if these ideas being used at the high school would apply at other schools and for clarification on how the dog in schools works. Ms. Cardwell asked if there could be a clear cut policy and expectations concerning dogs.
Ms. Jensen noted from the paperwork handed out that she would like to see more problem solving responses seen with Digital and Vanguard. Mr. Tarver noted that all the schools are working on the prevention issues.
Mr. Hill asked about the HOPE reference. Mr. Mason shared it is a great program being used through the assistance of a grant.  One feature included is a tool to measure the amount of hope or hopelessness in the lives of students and staff.  This is a great indicator to those trained in the program of how to help students/staff who may be struggling.

Discussion:  Discussion item added to the agenda.
Ms. Jensen asked Mr. Hill to share about the resolution he added to the agenda. He stated it provides another layer of protection from the pornography that may be available to students.
None of the other Board members had read the resolution at the time of the meeting.
Mr. Sabin noted he read the resolution and it will need to be brought to Cabinet.

Keera Michie noted the MLHS Band will be visiting the middle schools to show the students opportunities when they are in high school. The MLHS Curriculum Fair is coming up soon where students have booths for clubs and also for the advanced classes provided at MLHS. It is hoped that the AP classes are able to grow so more students will be able to take advantage of those classes.
Spring sports are on the horizon and will begin the end of February.
Miss Michie noted that the majority of the freshman class meets together in the library during lunch to play games and build relationships.
Miss Michie stated Mr. Zuver's sociology class is taking surveys on various issues at the high school. Students will be asked their opinion on parking passes, removal of bathroom doors, cell phone policies, as well as what their solution to these issues would be.
  Information: B. Board Comments
Paul Hill shared legislative information about it was suggested that an hour work session be done to talk about the positions we would like WSSDA to work on.
Ms. Breitenstein asked if we could move forward with school tours. Mr. Sabin suggested having the cabinet members help with tours on a day that would be convenient for the school.  He hopes to avoid having large groups entering and disrupting classrooms.
Ms. Urias commented about the article in the Herald regarding bullying. There will be a community event on the topic soon. She suggested having the SRO's and possibly security staff present to address what is going on in the schools concerning bullying.
Mr. Sabin noted the SROs will be honored at the next school board meeting. Possibly we will be able to have a presentation from the SROs.
Ms. Jensen asked Mr. O'Neil if there was an update on the video locking security system being put in the schools.
