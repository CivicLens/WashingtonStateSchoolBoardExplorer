Stockburger commented that he heard several parents express hope that Sehome High School
would be rebuilt/remodeled soon. He also attended a Reptile Man Assembly at Larrabee
Elementary School and expressed his appreciation for the work of the parent organizations,
which provide extracurricular activities for students. Director Stockburger enjoyed the Board
visit to Cordata Elementary School and commented how much difference a good facility makes
for teachers and students. He also attended a breakfast meeting with Dr. Baker and President
Bashaw.
Steve Smith met with Ralph Hayden, Director of Educational Technology, and Nancy Merry,
secretary to the Superintendent and Board support, to review the software program used for
preparing the Board agendas. The Board has asked Dr. Smith to review other options. He
attended the reception for College Bound Scholarship recipients. Each recipient receives a fouryear scholarship to a Washington college or university. He suggested establishing more outreach
to families in the beginning to reach more students. Director Smith enjoyed the Board’s visit to
Cordata Elementary School and was especially impressed with hearing about Principal Micah
Smith’s entry plan and how he identified the strengths and weaknesses and best practices for
overcoming each challenge. The teachers at the school use the same theme and are learning and
implementing best practices from each other.
Kelly Bashaw attended several of the events the other Board members attended. She also noted
Whatcom Community College recognized students who are receiving their high school diploma
and associate’s degree at the same time.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report
Dr. Greg Baker announced that Tanya Rowe, Director of Communications and Community
Relations, has returned from maternity/child care leave.
Dr. Baker introduced Food Services Manager Mark Dalton. Mr. Dalton and his team presented
an update on the Farm to School Program. The Farm to School Advisory Group is a multidisciplinary community group interested in improving food and increasing nutritional education
in the District. Organized in May 2010, the Advisory Group encourages healthy eating and
purchasing from local businesses and farms, which strengthens the local economy. A primary
goal is to connect the cafeteria to the classroom by educating students about the food of the
month. The Farm to School Program receives community support through volunteers and grants.
Mr. Dalton introduced Laura Plaut, the school garden coordinator, who updated the Board on
school gardens. Common Threads is a non-profit organization that educates students about the
benefits of growing their own food. Currently, nine schools have school gardens with four more
planned for the 2012–13 school year. School gardens benefit learning in many ways.
Assistant Superintendent of Business and Operations Ron Cowan reported on the status of
Birchwood Elementary School. Mr. Cowan introduced Kelly Smith, Dykeman Architects. Ms.
Smith gave an update on the preplanning and predesign work of the last few months. The
Birchwood Elementary Educational Specifications and Design Advisory Ad Hoc Committee is
currently meeting. To engage stakeholders in this work, the members of the committee include

representatives from the Birchwood neighborhood, families, staff and the community. A
summary of the pre-design work to date includes:
• Six committee meetings have been completed to draft educational specifications for
Birchwood. The goal is finalize these specifications with the committee before the end of
this school year.
• Two Birchwood Neighborhood meetings have involved gathering input to better
understand the vision the local neighborhood residents have for the project.
• A survey of Birchwood’s site is complete and the geotechnical report is in progress.
• The building assessment/structural evaluation is complete.
• The pre-application meeting with the City of Bellingham is complete.
Ms. Smith indicated the next steps include finalizing the educational specifications, submitting
the required environmental documents and preparing the site design and the schematic building
design. Based on a preliminary schedule, the school could be complete for the 2014–15 school
year. Ms. Smith responded to questions from the Board regarding the pros and cons of a twostory vs. a one-story building.
Dr. Baker and Executive Director of Human Resources Nora Klewiada updated the Board on
staffing. Dr. Baker thanked the team that has been working to finalizing the placement of staff.
Of the 32 staff members who received Reduction in Force letters, most have been fully or
partially restored to positions.
Superintendent Baker reported on a recent conference he attended at the invitation of the Gates
Foundation. Washington State sent a team to Harvard for an institute focused on early childhood
learning (birth through third grade). Leaders from around the world shared information on the
importance of early education, which reinforced the move to establish full-time kindergarten
beginning with the 2011–12 school year.
Dr. Baker, Deputy Superintendent Tom Venable, and Executive Director Steve Clarke visited
schools in Federal Way and Portland. In Federal Way, they visited a school that has worked to
accelerate its curriculum by automatically scheduling students for Advanced Placement classes
who score a certain level on tests with an opt out provision. Students can also challenge any
course. In Portland, they visited a school for gifted and talented students, an International
Baccalaureate high school, an elementary school that has a student population that is 95%
free/reduced lunch program. This school has partnered with a community partner in a shared
facility. They also visited an alternative school and the lowest performing high school in the state
to observe how they are reformatting the school to improve learning.
Dr. Baker informed the Board he will be sending them information on the Culminating Project
with a proposal on how the program can continue at a reduced cost.
Deputy Superintendent Tom Venable has been meeting with a middle school team to review the
middle school calendar.
The Board will hold a study session on the budget at the June 14 Board meeting. The Board will
be asked to vote on the 2012–13 budget at the June 28 Board meeting.
