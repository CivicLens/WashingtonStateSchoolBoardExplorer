were corrections, updates, and the elimination of policies and procedures that were deemed to no longer
be needed. In that months issue of Policy News, WSSDA explained, Some policies had become obsolete
and were no longer necessary to retain at a policy level. Some smaller policies were absorbed into
another policy when the content covered the same issue.
At their regular meeting on November 23, the board approved "First Reading" of updates to the policies
listed below. At this meeting, the board is asked to approve "Second Reading" and adoption of these
policy updates, and to concurrently approve retirement of the policies further listed below. The
procedures do not require formal approval but are provided for additional review and information.
