3. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
Information: 3.01 Discussion About Next Steps following the Levy Failure
Mr. McLaurin provided an introduction of why this special meeting of the school board
was called. He explained that the Ferndale School Programs and Operation Levy ballot
measure of February 11, 2020 had failed. He reviewed the information about the pros and
cons that the school board considered in setting the levy rate and placing the measure on
the ballot. He reported that out of 145 districts that ran ballot measures in the February
election all but 12 communities approved their local levies, including the six other district
in Whatcom County. In Ferndale's case, the levy failed with 56% of the voters saying
they would not support the levy.
Mr. McLaurin conveyed to the audience that he appreciated them being here this evening.
He explained that the board would not be receiving public comment, however the board
did want to hear from its constituents. He encouraged audience members to send their

comments to the board via the paper comment form at the back of the room, via the
board's online portal or email to the board.
Mr. McLaurin added that the goal this evening is to make a decision that provides
students with the best education possible.
Mr. McLaurin's verbatim remarks are attached hereto and make a part of the minutes.
At this time, Dr. Quinn presented a Powerpoint presentation to the board and explained
the district's current situation and what next steps by the board might look like. She spoke
to the extent of the custs that will be necessary to operate the school district 1) without a
levy or 2) with a levy at the $1.50 rate. She said that to maintain programs going forward
the district was anticipating $13 million per year from the levy. Eighty-four percent of the
district's budget is spent on personnel. She explained that some non-employee expenses
are fixed, such as utilities, insurance and more. And, some programs, like special
education and transportation, have legal requirements that the district must meet.
Dr. Quinn presented an overview of what the draft budget reductions would be if the
board chose not to run the ballot measure again or if they did choose to run the measure
and it failed again. Due to how funding is received by the district, in the first year the
district would need to make reductions in the amount of $7 million; and in the second
year, reductions would need to be made in the amount of $13 million. Dr. Quinn added
that no matter what decision the board makes, the district still needs to plan for budget
reductions. There are requirements in the law and collective bargaining units that the
district must meet.
Note, the Powerpoint document that Dr. Quinn presented is attached hereto and made a
part of the minutes.
Dr. Quinn presented the four decisions that the board should consider. They were,
•Run the levy again in 2020 – YES or NO?
•If YES, run it in April, August or November?
•If YES, run it at $2.50, $1.50 or a number in between?
•If YES, run it for 1, 2, 3, or 4 years?
Board members discussed the impact of the levy failure and how the district should move
forward. They struggled with the changes made by the legislature during the last couple
of years that impacted school funding and the public's understanding of the legislature's
actions.

Board members talked about the ramifications of running the levy again in April or
August. If they choose to run it in April and it passed the number of layoffs would be
reduced. If they choose to run it in August, then the reduction in force process would be
implemented this spring.
Some discussion centered around trust issues that some community members have with
the district. Public criticism is still being heard about the things that happened as part of
past bond measures. It was noted that it might be better to have additional time to provide
more detailed information to the public and, thus, run the measure again in August.
Dr. Quinn said the district analyzed the voting data from the recent election. She said the
measure received the same amount of "no" votes as in the last few school levies.
Board members talked about support from the community if the levy was run at various
rates. Ms. Cool suggested waiting to run the measure until August. She said it would give
the district more time to educate the public about the need for the levy and to address
other concerns being brought to the district's attention like trust. Ms. Riddle said running
it in August was somewhat worrisome because the district has never run a measure in
August before. Ms. Cool noted that other Whatcom County districts were able to inform
their communities enough to pass $2.50 levies. Time may be what is needed to inform the
public.
Ultimately, the Board did not make make a decision about re-running the levy. Board
members came to consensus that in order to made a decision they needed to hear from
district staff and the Ferndale Community.
The board decided to hold two community forums—one on February 22 and one on
February 24 in order to provide information to the public and to receive input back about
how people feel about the current situation.
Dr. Quinn noted that should the board choose to run the ballot measure in April, there is a
tight timeline for that to occur. Ballot measures for the April election are due to the
county auditor no later than February 28.
The board requested that the administration, in preparation for the board possibly placing
a measure on the April ballot, draft two resolutions—one establishing a levy for two
years at the $1.50 rate and the other leaving the rate "blank" for two years. Consideration
of this matter will be placed on the February 25, 2020 school board business meeting.
