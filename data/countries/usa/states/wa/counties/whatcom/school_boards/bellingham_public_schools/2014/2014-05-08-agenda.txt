2.9 Ratify Superintendent's Signature Regarding Safe
Routes to School Grant

Meeting :

May 8, 2014 - Regular Board Meeting with Study
Session

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted a request for ratification of the
Superintendent's signature on the attached Letter of Intent in
connection with a grant fund proposal relating to
improvements to Aldrich Road, near Cordata Elementary
School. Approval of the grant would mean safety
enhancements to walking and biking routes near the school in
return for a relatively small financial investment from our
district. As Superintendent, I recommend ratification of my
signature and am submitting the Letter of Intent as a consent
agenda item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
Last week we were approached by the City of Bellingham regarding a grant partnership opportunity that would provide significant
improvements to Aldrich Road, the main roadway servicing Cordata Elementary School. If successful, the grant would fund asphalt widening
for 5-foot-wide marked bike lanes, concrete curb and gutter, storm water conveyance, planting strip, and a 5-foot-wide concrete sidewalk.
This would create a continuous safe walking route along the east side of Aldrich Road between the intersection of Aldrich Road and
Northwest Road and the future intersection of Aldrich Road and Horton Road (see attached, Safe Routes Grant Graphic.pdf). There are
currently 30+ children who would no longer need to be bused to Cordata once this sidewalk is completed. Further, when the approved 344
homes north and south of June Roadare occupied, many more children will be able to walk to Cordata instead of being bused.
A key component of the grant application is to demonstrate consultation and cooperation between the City of Bellingham and the Bellingham
School District. A financial contribution from the District to provide $75,000, matched by $75,000 from the City, (an 11.5% total local match to
the $1.3 million project cost), will significantly strengthen the grant application by demonstrating cooperation, providing evidence of a joint
commitment to the needs of Cordata Elementary school children, and helping us score the maximum number of points needed to get this
project funded. According to our city partners, without a financial commitment from the District, it is extremely unlikely that the application will
be able to compete against grant requests from other jurisdictions.
We are seeking your ratification of the Superintendents signature on the Letter of Intent (see attached LOI.pdf) because we were not made
aware of the grant opportunity until after your last meeting and the grant deadline is on May 5, prior to your next meeting on May 8.This is a
one-time opportunity to get a great return on a relatively small investment which will benefit school children for many generations.

We will be notified of a grant award in June 2015. If we are successful, project construction would likely begin in either the summer of 2016
or 2017, depending on constraints associated with environmental impacts, off-site mitigation, and permitting.
