Public Content
Board Policy 6212, Charge Cards, states that the board authorizes the district to issue charge cards to officers and staff for
district purchases, acquisitions, and authorized travel where a credit card is the only option. All charge card purchases must be
in compliance with all Board Policies referencing allowable costs. These policies specifically include but are not limited to: 6114
Gifts and Donations, 6210 Purchasing Authorization and Control, and 6240 Food and beverage Consumption. The board must
approve any contract for the issuance of credit cards, including the credit limit.
Oak Harbor School District currently has a Purchase Card contract with US Bank with a credit line of $200,000 for 42 card
holders. All OHSD administrators are issued a card, and the Business Office retains 5 districtwide cards that can be signed out
as needed.
The Purchase Card program has improved efficiency, flexibility, and convenience related to the purchase of goods and services.
However, over the last ten years flexibility has evolved into charge cards as the only option for payment in many areas. These
areas include, but are not limited to, online learning resources and memberships, conference registrations, lodging for employee
and student travel, and heavily utilized vendors.
After careful review by the Business Office, as well as US Bank, we have concluded that in order to continue seamless purchase
of goods and services where charge cards are the only payment option, the District will need to increase the District credit limit
from $200,000 to $450,000.
