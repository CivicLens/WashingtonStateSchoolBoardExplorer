REPORTS
Whatcom Middle School Project Update
Assistant Superintendent Ron Cowan introduced Dave Swanson, Reid Middleton Engineering;
John Jones, Dykeman Architects; and Bill Smith, Dawson Construction, all key members of the
Whatcom Middle School reconstruction effort. Mr. Swanson reviewed work on the shell and
core. Interior demolition has started which will be followed by the interior improvements.
Mr. Jones reviewed the architectural schematic design for the school. The design team has
worked closely with the Whatcom Middle School Design Advisory Committee to translate the
educational specifications into graphic representations, including site and floor plans. As
explained by Jones, most of the site plan will remain the same as the building footprints will not
be altered. However, one exciting change is to reactivate the historic 1903 entry into the new
Commons area. Several iterations of the schematic design have been analyzed with regard to
functional validity and conceptual organization, as well as environmental and esthetic qualities,
resulting in a set of schematic drawings which incorporate as much of that information as
possible.
Ron Cowan responded to questions from the Board and indicated the school is scheduled to open
in the fall of 2012, although the entire team is working to accelerate the schedule.

ACTION ITEMS
Whatcom Middle School Schematic Design Approval
Kelly Bashaw moved and Steve Smith seconded the motion to approve the schematic design for
Whatcom Middle School. The motion carried unanimously.
