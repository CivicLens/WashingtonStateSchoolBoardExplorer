because he said none of this matter without student

voice. They care and have a lot to say. He loves our community and said that these are OUR kids. He extended

an

invitation to volunteer in schools or mentor so you can impact a child.
Student Representative Nora Ramstad

is grateful that student Voice was emphasized

so well in the Strategic Plan.

Giving them the opportunity is valued. What she loves about the district and what she is grateful for is empowering
students and that it’s never been a question that student voice needs to be valued.
President Rotter clarified that the board is committed to the strategic plan and that this isn't new work. The board has
been laying the ground work for some time. This has been a recognized
instrumental

need for quite some time. The board has been

in getting the pieces in place for the Strategic plan. She explained that academic data is not the only

thing that we should be paying attention to. Our students of color, special education, and English language learners
are the students that are not doing well and that is a majority of who we serve. The board has been focusing on

equity and behind the data- those are kid. The complexity of their lives requires us to have a holistic approach.
excitement is that the Strategic provides clarity and clear path forward.

Her

Sharing data should not be used for shame

and blame. We are lucky that this district has a supportive generous community

but in pockets. We have been lucky to

mobilize community together from the Superintendent search. There are bright spots in our district beyond
standardized testing. It is important to be looking at what is out there and what is the real data. She encouraged
everyone to look at the graduation

rates that have been increasing since 2017. And the trending up is students of

color. Gaps are getting smaller. We have also seen encouraging trends in post-secondary enrollment.

Gaps are also

getting smaller for students of color. This year 19 students received their AA at the same time as diploma. That is
about 5%.
