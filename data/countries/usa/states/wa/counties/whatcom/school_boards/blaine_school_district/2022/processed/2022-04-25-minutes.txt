Director Leu commented on the budget preparation timeline which includes an opportunity for public review of the draft budget when it is made available on July 10, as well as for questions and discussion in the public hearing at the board's July meeting. Discussion continued regarding the district's timeline for budget preparation. Director Gibson read from a written statement provided by President Thomas which expressed appreciation and confidence in the budget preparation work done by the district's administration, and was not in favor of adding another work session to the calendar. Directors Leu and Gibson indicated they are comfortable with the district's budget preparation procedure. Director Creydt reiterated her desire to gain a better understanding about the budget, and Dr. Granger assured her that she has access to the same resources and opportunities as all board members to improve understanding. He described the resources available to all new directors for learning to understand the budget. Those resources include attendance at the annual WSSDA conference, online resources, and conversations with Dr. Granger directly. Dr. Granger encouraged Director Creydt to take advantage of the resources available to her for this purpose, and discussion continued.
