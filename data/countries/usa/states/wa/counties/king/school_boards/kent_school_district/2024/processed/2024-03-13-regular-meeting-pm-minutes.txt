AGENDA ITEM:
Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

BOARD GOALS:

RECOMMENDATION:

Managed Internal Broadband Service Award of Contract to Ednetics
AGENDA ITEM:
The Kent School District network has over 60,000 connected devices including computers, phones,
printers, wireless access points, interactive displays, environmental controls, irrigation controls, intercom
systems, UPS, security cameras, alarm systems, and data center servers, storage, etc. With the
dependency on KSDs network, it must be monitored and managed 24x7x365 to reduce the likelihood of a
service outage.

Currently, KSD network team members monitor network health during normal business hours which
leaves an after-hours gap (after hours alerts are supported best-effort based on severity). Fortunately, the
Federal E-Rate funding program recognizes that school district networks are critical infrastructure and
provide discounts for 24x7x365 Managed Internal Broadband Services (MIBS). MIBS can be used for:
24x7x365 network monitoring and alert handling.
Remote network outage remediation.
Critical network vulnerability patching and software upgrades.
Priority training of KSD network staff on new products and software features.
Daily off-site network configuration backup and retention.
To address these needs, KSD issued an RFP via the E-Rate program for MIBS to fully monitor and
manage KSDs 2,745+ network infrastructure devices with the expectation that KSD will qualify for an
80% discount on all eligible MIBS services.
Proposal Received:
Kent School District received a single proposal that meets all RFP criteria and is summarized below.

Added Internet Capacity Award of Contract to King County I-Net
AGENDA ITEM:
Kent School District utilizes two Internet Service Providers (ISPs), to meet the districts Internet
connectivity needs. KSDs primary ISP is Washington State (K-20 network), and supplemental ISP
services are provided by King Countys Institutional Network (KC I-NET). Supplemental ISP services are
needed to provide Internet bandwidth capacity above and beyond the existing K-20 service. The current
KC-INET contract, through E-Rate, expires May 2025.
To avoid supplemental ISP services disruption, an RFP was issued using the Federal E-Rate funding
program. The RFP solicited proposals for added Internet capacity with a subscribed speed of 10 Gbps
and a term of 3 to 5 years with options for renewals thereafter.
Proposals Received
Kent School District received two proposals from two separate organizations, each including various
solution options and terms. Best matching, cost-effective proposals were selected and are summarized
below.

Note: Although King Countys proposed solution is more costly, it will offer enhanced resilience against
future internet outages that Lumens solution would not (as stated in the RFP). Recent ISP service outage
example that would have been prevented include full school day outages on October 16th and December
1st of 2023. Additionally, the new contract will supersede the existing KC I-NET contract.

The Kent School Districts wide area network (WAN) interconnects each of KSDs 44 campuses across 72
square miles with 60,000+ network connected devices (computers, phones, printers, wireless access
points, intercom systems, security cameras & alarms, etc.). It is imperative that the WAN be upgraded
periodically to handle the increasing bandwidth demands that are placed on it. To support needed WAN
upgrades at 24 KSD campuses, an RFP was issued in January 2024 using the Federal E-Rate program,
and proposals were solicited for fiber WAN service with a minimum subscribed speed of 5Gbs and term
options for both 60 and 120 months.

Per Policy 2152: Student Travel-Field Trips & Excursions, the board recognizes that field trips when used
as a device for teaching and learning integral to the curriculum are an educationally sound and important
ingredient in the instructional program of the schools. Such trips can supplement and enrich classroom
procedures by providing learning experiences in an environment beyond the classroom. The board also
recognizes the value and need for field trips and travel associated with the activities and interscholastic
athletic program. Field trips that take students out of state must be approved in advance by the school
board.

athletic program. Field trips that take students out of state must be approved in advance by the school
board.
