Director Creydt asked if the wait list for HomeConnection would offset the deficit.
  B. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of May which included overall tax collection at a rate similar to past years. The district will receive approximately $808,000 in stabilization funding from the state for the purpose of off-setting the impact of decreased enrollment related to the pandemic. Ms. Porter described the timeline for claiming federal stimulus funding. The anticipated total amount will be approximately $4.5M, most of which will be applied to the 2021-22 fiscal year. Approximately $807,000 will be reserved for 2022-23 expenses. Director Creydt asked about the allocation of funds being reimbursed and discussion followed. The draft budget will be available for public review by the July 10th deadline. At the Public Hearing during the July 25 meeting, Ms. Porter will provide a presentation on the draft 2022-2023 budget which will include an opportunity to review budget details.
  C. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Dr. Granger expressed his appreciation for the efforts of campus staff to ensure that the school year finished strong. For the first time in 826 days, all staff were able to gather in the PAC on the last day of school for the annual year-end celebration.
Discussions are ongoing with the City of Blaine regarding plans for a sewer project on Pipeline Road. A legislative advocate will be utilized to assist with securing funds from the state.
At the July meeting, the board will consider a third party partnership with the leadership team, to do whatever we can to support staff health, wellness, motivation and development. This work will begin with campus administrators in the month of July, and Dr. Granger expressed enthusiasm at the opportunity to partner with staff groups in this process.

  6. Action Items
A. High School Literacy Curriculum Adoption: myPerspectives
Dr. Granger reviewed the district's process for selecting this new literacy curriculum which will be used primarily at the 9-12 level, with one 7th grade teacher doing a pilot program. President Thomas asked about alignment with Fountas & Pinnell, and Dr. Granger explained that Fountas & Pinnell stops at 6th grade. The 7th and 8th grade literacy curriculum is yet to be determined. Director Gibson thanked Director Leu for his participation in the work of the Instructional Materials Review Committee (IMRC). Director Leu shared positive comments on the proposed curriculum, and then explained his intent to abstain from voting on its adoption to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. The district's legal counsel has indicated that there is no conflict and Director Leu would not benefit in any way from this adoption. However, because Director Leu had author status on a prior version of curriculum for Pearson which has been purchased by this publisher, he would prefer to abstain from voting for the sake of complete transparency. President Thomas commented on the number of people involved in reviewing the curriculum, and discussion continued.

The board approved adoption of the myPerspectives literacy curriculum for Blaine High School.
President Thomas declared the 4-0 vote with one abstention.
Motion by Charles E Gibson, second by Dougal Thomas
Final Resolution: Motion Carries 4-0, 1 abstaining
Yea: Todd Nunamaker, Dougal Thomas, Erika Creydt, Charles E Gibson
Abstain: Don Leu

Final Resolution: Motion Carries 5-0
Yea: Todd Nunamaker, Dougal Thomas, Erika Creydt, Charles E Gibson, Don Leu
  C. Discussion Regarding Future Board Meeting Format
The directors discussed the format for future board meetings. Dr. Granger shared information from his research. Ferndale School District will continue to provide a virtual option utilizing a third party host as well as a designated staff member. The other Whatcom County school districts have transitioned to in-person only meetings. Dr. Granger described the quote he received from Swagit Productions which is the vendor used in Ferndale. The up-front cost would be roughly equivalent to a teacher's salary, with a $1,600 monthly fee for ongoing service. Director Creydt shared information that she received from a Swagit sales representative which included cheaper options.
  Discussion continued. Director Creydt gave multiple examples of how the virtual option would provide parents with easier access to school board meetings. She commented on the district's obligation to operate with transparency.  Dr. Granger commented that the board would be deviating from past practice by incurring significant expense on a service that does not directly impact students. Director Leu expressed concerns related to online security, as well as to the cost when compared to the number of virtual participants. He mentioned alternative ways for parents to be informed, and he expressed a preference to prioritize spending on student needs. President Thomas questioned how the virtual option would benefit students, and he expressed concern about using a cheap service.
  During this discussion, internet service in the boardroom was temporarily unavailable which caused an interruption in the access for those watching the meeting virtually.

Director Leu made a motion to return to board meeting policies that encourage in-person attendance and participation by citizens and ending makeshift streaming of board meetings. Discussion continued. Director Gibson called a point of order because there was no second to the motion. He then seconded the motion, and more discussion followed. Director Nunamaker shared comments related to his attendance at the Lynden School Board meeting where they have returned to a pre-COVID in-person format. He remains open to considering a virtual option, but does not see a need to rush into it.
  The board voted 4-1 in favor of a return to board meeting policies that encourage in-person attendance and participation by citizens and ending makeshift streaming of board meetings.
Motion by Don Leu, second by Charles E Gibson
Final Resolution: Motion Carries 4-1
Yea: Todd Nunamaker, Dougal Thomas, Charles E Gibson, Don Leu
Nay: Erika Creydt
  7. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)
A. General Comments

Director Creydt stated that she strongly disagrees and discussion continued. Director Leu expressed concern about the board becoming divided. President Thomas reminded the directors that individuals who need a modification to participate in a board meeting can contact the District Office in advance to make special arrangements.
  There was additional discussion regarding the directors' format preferences for receiving public comments.

Director Nunamaker commented on the benefit of seeing someone's body language and hearing their tone of voice in oral comments.
