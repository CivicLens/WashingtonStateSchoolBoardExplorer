POLICY GOVERNANCE REVIEW
Ends Monitoring Reports 2.0 and 2.1
Dr. Baker introduced Department of Teaching and Learning (DTL) team members Mike
Copland, Deputy Superintendent; Amy Carder, Director-English Language Learners
(ELL); Justin May, Doctoral Resident; and Brian Rick, Director, Research and
Assessment.
Dr. Copland discussed the purpose of monitoring reports, which are a requirement of
Policy Governance policies. The reports are used as a tool by the board to help determine
the superintendent’s progress toward the mission, vision and outcomes defined within the
district’s strategic plan, The Bellingham Promise.
The Board viewed a PowerPoint Presentation relating to Ends Monitoring Reports 2.0 and
2.1. Team members highlighted key points of the monitoring reports, including:
 The Evidence and Artifacts Matrix, noting it is a framework to connect the high
level, global outcomes from End 2.0 with the more specific, targeted achievement
measures included in End 2.1
 Methodology for Identifying Comparable High Performing Districts
 Data Set, Analysis of Progress and Summary Statements
The team also summarized its analysis of achievement trends for Hispanic students,
students in Special Education, participation in post-secondary and career-ready courses,
and graduation rates.
Following is a summary of comments from board members:
 It would be helpful to measure achievement based on comparable districts.
 Trends as presented are useful in comparing changes in assessment; however,
specific goals and benchmarks should also be established.
 In discussing changing assessment methodology, the question “what is doable?”
must be considered.

Year-to-year trends in specific subject areas (i.e., music, physical education, and
social studies) would be helpful.
Do we see trends among our own students? Specific data on achievement trends
within each group is needed; i.e., in what direction are Level 1, 2, 3, and 4 students
moving?
Specific data regarding trends in achievement for Highly Capable Learners (HCL)
is needed.
The district’s overall placement – 7th of 32 comparable districts – is a positive
indicator.
Can proficiency levels be broken into sub-groups (i.e, low income, ELL, etc.)?
Can Advanced Placement scores be broken into sub-groups (i.e., low income,
ELL, etc.)?
What is the methodology for identifying high-performing districts?
Why is the determination of comparable districts limited by size? Why not
compare Bellingham to districts such as Bellevue or Federal Way or Mercer
Island? If we are trying to determine how to make our district better, we cannot
ignore those districts.
Need to define the “gold standard” that we want to be measured against.
We want to show we are making progress with all students. Individual student
growth measurement will allow that.
Should we start to focus on measurements in early education? Elementary teachers
have expressed that it would be helpful to have test information on students in
preschool and early grades.

held Oct. 12 to benefit the Bellingham Public Schools Foundation and
Communities in Schools.

Board Assessment of Meeting

Session.

STUDY SESSION
Understanding the Promise Project
The study session began at 7:55 p.m. In addition to the Board of Directors, district staff
included: Deputy Superintendent Mike Copland, Assistant Superintendent Ron Cowan,
Assistant Superintendent Steve Clarke, Assistant Superintendent Bob Kuehl; Executive
Administrator Rob McElroy, Executive Director of Communication and Community
Relations Tanya Rowe, and Department of Teaching and Learning Directors Amy Carder
and Brian Rick.
Dr. Copland explained the purpose of the study session, noting it was to continue the
dialogue with the board concerning the direction of the Ends reporting. He added that the
term Metrics Project has been changed to Understanding the Promise Project (UPP).
Board members reviewed handouts, including drafts of the Beta Scorecard, Ends-3.0
indicators, and the Social-Emotional Learning chart.
Study session participants broke into sub-groups to engage in a more in-depth discussion
of how the district could measure Ends-3.0 indicators. Spokespersons for each group then
shared the results of these discussions.
Comments relating to possible measurements that might be considered as indicators
relevant to Ends-3.0 included the following:
 What is the number of students who participate in science fairs?
 How many seniors feel confident that they will be successful in the future?
(possible measurement of optimism)
 If you can define an attribute, you can measure it (i.e., “grit”).
 What percentages of students’ families have health insurance?
 What is the percentage of students who have traveled outside of the country?
 What percentage of students have not told a lie in the fifth grade? (possible
measurement of honest and ethical citizens who act with integrity)
 What percentage of students have not been arrested in the five years following
their graduation? (possible measurement of honest and ethical citizens who act
with integrity)
A discussion with board members ensued. Summary of comments:
 Goals must be broken down into different levels within the district. Buy-in is
important. These must be actionable, “real” goals that are understandable and
appreciated.
 It is important to be mindful of how this relates to the teacher evaluation system.

8.1

An agreed-upon end product, and how to measure it, is an important aspect of this
work.
Efforts must begin at the pre-school level or before.
What does teaching look like? The message must be that teachers are everywhere;
for example, they include bus drivers, custodians, etc.
Meaningful parent engagement is an important aspect. Parent-Teacher
Associations need resources to offer parent education.
The district should consider creating a scorecard that goes from pre-natal classes to
“x” number of years after graduation. This is exciting and valuable work, and it
would be great 25 years from now to see what such a scorecard would look like.
Question regarding scale: even if we consider using five indicators, the process of
implementation can be daunting. We have to be thoughtful about the process;
going slowly and doing it well.
The International Baccalaureate program addresses many of these attributes.
Role modeling is important; teaching students to “dream big.”
