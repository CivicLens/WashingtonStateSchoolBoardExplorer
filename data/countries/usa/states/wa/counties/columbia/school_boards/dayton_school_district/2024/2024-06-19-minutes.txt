Business manager Eaton reviewed the ASB packet given to coaches and advisors, a handout on ASB Policy & Procedures which includes information from the WASBO ASB manual on student involvement and a sample budget planning document.

Board member Griffen would like to move forward with Rick Maloney due to his experience with the program. Board member Paulson asked if incoming Superintendent Wheatley was on board with the program. Mr. Stewart indicated he is and Mr. Wheatley has checked in with other districts to get more information on policy governance. The board is interested in moving forward and would like to discuss this in depth with Mr. Wheatley.

Middle school football practice will start on August 29th with the option to attend starting the 21st. Middle school volleyball is pending but will likely start the first week of school. Athletic director Korslund submitted his recommendation for renewal of coaching staff as presented in the consent agenda.
  D. Administrator Reports - Elementary & Secondary Principals
Elementary principal Amy Cox submitted her report electronically. Principal Cox reported on field trips, testing, academic achievements, and staff training. In May, at an elementary assembly, Reagyn Fabian was selected by Walla Walla Crime Watch as Superintendent of the Day for the penitentiary. Representatives from Crime Watch and the penitentiary superintendent were on site to present the award. Elementary staff recognized retiring teacher Polla Laib for her 38 years of service to the Dayton School District. Polla's family were in attendance as staff and students presented Mrs. Laib with a poem, gifts, books, singing and flowers.
  Secondary principal Joyce submitted her report electronically. Principal Joyce reported on school climate, communications, academic excellence and class, classroom and club celebrations. Ms. Joyce reported attendance was a focus this year.  Secondary staff decided on a goal of 35% improvement of 90% attendance comparing semester 1 to semester 2. The high school did meet the goal by the end of the year with 45.4% of the students attaining 90% or better all year. There were some initial problems with the data that included students being marked absent for school sponsored events such as sports and club activities. Most of the data was corrected however there still may be some areas needing corrected. On the last full day of school, most of our 8-11 grade students participated in an outdoor hike event. Students reported they loved the time to connect with other students and 8th grade students enjoyed their first high school event. 8th grade students came back to school a little early so they could participate in their 8th grade promotion celebration. 6th grade outdoor environmental camp at Camp Wooten was amazing for our students. They learned a lot about the outdoors through mini sessions held during the week. A big highlight was the use of the pool which has been closed for the past two years during our week at camp.
