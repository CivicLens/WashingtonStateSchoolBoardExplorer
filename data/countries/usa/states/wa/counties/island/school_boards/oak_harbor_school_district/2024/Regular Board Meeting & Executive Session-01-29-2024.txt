Public Content
Building Commissioning (Cx) is a systematic process of coordination and testing to ensure that a building performs in
accordance with the design. The process helps to ensure that the building operates initially as the owner intends and that staff
are prepared to operate and maintain the buildings systems. A well-commissioned building will have fewer problems, require less
maintenance and operate more cost-effectively. Because it has been such a long time since the District has had a new building,
including the enhanced Cx tasks is a sound investment.

Cx is a requirement for all OSPI School Construction Assistance Program (SCAP) funded projects over 15,000 square feet and
is also requirement for LEED Green Building Certification. Although these projects do not fall under the same requirements, it is
a demonstration of how important the Cx process is to a successful school construction project.

Additional information about Cx can be found in this NW Energy Efficiency Council fact sheet:https://www.waenergycodes.com/
