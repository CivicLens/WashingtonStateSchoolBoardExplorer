REGULAR MEETING AGENDA

The Eastmont School District is governed by a board of five directors. The Eastmont Board of Directors sets the
direction of the District by establishing goals, objectives, and policies to guide the superintendent who supervises all
programs and staff. The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that the Eastmont School District is adequately
financed to meet those goals, objectives, and policies; for monitoring the progress of the District; and for evaluating the
performance of the superintendent. Each board member has a fiduciary role to the District and, as such is responsible
for using his or her best judgment in conducting the affairs of the District.
The Board generally meets at 5:30 p.m. on the second and fourth Monday of each month at either a school site or the
Administration Office Board Room at 800 Eastmont Avenue, East Wenatchee. On holidays, or when a conflict occurs,
a meeting may be held at an alternate time and/or date with proper notification given to the media.
