Superintendent, Director of Finance, Human Resources, and Operations David Cram presented a high-level PPT on the upcoming EPO replacement levy that would begin in 2026. The PPT is available in BoardDocs. Superintendent Cram explained the funding difference between an EPO levy, the bond debt on the construction of the new middle school, and levy caps. He also, highly suggests the board consider asking the voters to support a tech/capital levy in addition to the EPO replacement levy.
EPO Levy:  EPO funds enable the District to support educational programs and operations, including teaching, school supplies, technology, athletics, building maintenance, transportation, and other educational needs. School district enrichment levies are limited to the lesser of $2,500 per pupil($3,149.69 current), as increased by inflation, or $2.50 per $1,000 assessed property valuation. Currently, LCSD collects the lowest taxation amount from any district in the county, except Anacortes because they receive a lot of funding from the refineries.
Bonds:  Bonds are used for new construction and large renovations of existing buildings.
The proposed schedule of the next steps is as follows:
September – October:  Draft and adopt a resolution for Levy.  Reconvene Levy committee.
November – December:  File with county for February ballot.   Start disbursing the Levy information.
January – February:  Hold community engagement meetings.
