  3. Reports
A. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided a final report on enrollment for the 2020-2021 school year which ended approximately 74 FTE below the original budgeted level. The impact of this year's low enrollment was reviewed in the Financial Report.
  B. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of May. Revenue received earlier in the year was lower than normal, but spending was also much lower than a typical year. Although the general fund has followed similar patterns to prior years, reduced expenditures has allowed the district to end this year with more cash on hand. Ms. Porter feels confident in the district's financial position moving into the next budget year, despite many uncertainties. A public hearing will take place during the board's regular meeting in August, giving patrons the opportunity to raise concerns or objections. In that same meeting, the board will be asked to adopt the proposed budget for the 2021-22 fiscal year. President Gibson asked about expectations for trends in future years, and discussion followed regarding the impact of temporary revenue sources following the pandemic.
  C. Borderite Athletics Report
Athletics Director Sean Linville provided the board with a Borderite Athletics report. This year's short seasons have now finished up, and being able to provide students with the opportunity to play sports during the pandemic felt like a huge victory. Just being able to play was a win! Blaine sports teams operated safely and without the significant cancellations experienced by other schools. Protocols for operating athletics during the COVID pandemic were reviewed and included COVID testing for wrestlers. Use of the Final Forms online platform was successful for registering student athletes, as well as for communication. Loss of the NWC Athletics website platform added another challenge, but the new website (www.goborderites.com) has been successful. The old concession stand building has been converted into a locker room for visiting teams. Mr. Linville explained the focus to be placed on improved communication with parents next year in hopes of avoiding unnecessary challenges. Plans have resumed to bring in Clint Rutledge for a workshop with coaches. Other plans for next year include development of a handbook for parents, coaches, and players as well as the Friday Greeter program.

Director Nunamaker shared his thoughts about the Borderite cheerleading team and ways that the district could support them in their representation of our school as the "face" of our athletic teams. Director Thomas asked why the NWC website was no longer available and discussion followed. There was also discussion regarding the development of new handbooks.

Director Thomas publicly shared comments of appreciation for how hard Sean Linville worked to make athletics possible for students this spring.
  D. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Summer 2021: Access to the DreamBox Math program will be available for K-8 students. Letters with information about the program were mailed to families on June 25. A summer workout program is being provided for student athletes, and access to the stadium and track is being made available to the community during specific hours. A meeting with community groups is scheduled on August 2 at 6:00 p.m. for the purpose of scheduling facility use.
Staffing: Dr. Granger described support that will be provided to families by the Student Deans in the areas of SEL and attendance/engagement. By increasing the high school's AVID teacher position to full time, additional electives will be made available to students. In addition, a high school science teaching position will also be increased to full time to include hands-on instruction in geology. New K-5 teacher positions will also support early literacy and K-5 math intervention.
Budget Planning: Considerations include determination of a projected enrollment. Tentative agreements have now been reached with both SEIU and BEA. Dr. Granger expressed appreciation for the collaborative work with both groups in getting these negotiations completed. A draft budget will be made available for review by the July 10 deadline. The board's regular meeting in August will include a public hearing and consideration of budget adoption for the 2021-2022 fiscal year.
2021-2022: New guidance for schools is expected in the coming weeks, but Dr. Granger does not anticipate any significant changes. We continue to look forward to having students attend in person full time every day.
HB 2022: Dr. Granger provided an explanation regarding the state's new mandate for board member training in cultural competency, equity, diversity, and inclusion. This training requirement is for school board directors and is not a curriculum or instructional requirement for students. Dr. Granger expects this to be addressed at WSSDA's annual conference in November.
Board Meeting Discussion: At the July meeting, the board will be asked to approve adjustments to the 2021-2022 board meeting calendar. Presentation of prior year progress reports and coming year goals will be combined in the August work session. The work session for mid-year updates will be moved to February.
Discussion continued regarding the completion of BEA negotiations which resulted in a wage increase of just over 4%. Dr. Granger again commented on the collaborative nature of both the SEIU and BEA bargaining teams which speaks to their commitment to students and community.
  There was further discussion on the new requirement for board member training.

Director Thomas asked about the impact of enrollment on budget planning and discussion continued regarding how projected enrollment is determined. Amber Porter provided detail regarding her method of calculating projected enrollment based upon spring enrollment and student advancement. Ms. Porter does not believe the district needs to rely on increased enrollment in order to create a balanced budget for 2021-22. Director Nunamaker asked about tracking students who have withdrawn and Dr. Granger explained efforts by school administrators to connect with those families.

  5. Action Items
A. Directors and Executive Directors 2021-2022 Contracts
Dr. Granger explained adjustments to the district's leadership structure. There will now be two executive directors instead of three, with two directors in the Teaching & Learning Department. President Gibson asked about their wage increase and Dr. Granger explained that all the district's employee groups have received a wage increase of approximately 4%. He further explained that the cost of one of the director positions is effectively absorbed by eliminating the shared middle/high school assistant principal position. Discussion continued regarding the contracts' wages. Director Thomas acknowledged that it's a lot of money, but the increase is commensurate with the increase given to other administrator and employee groups. Dr. Granger added comments on the importance of these positions in support of the work of teachers and campus employees. He acknowledged the work of former Superintendent Spanjer in bringing the district's administrative positions up to a level that encourages staff growth and stays competitive with other districts in the region. Director Thomas commented on the importance of having a strong leadership team, and Director Nunamaker expressed appreciation for this clarification.
  The board approved the 2021-2022 contracts for all Directors and Executive Directors.
