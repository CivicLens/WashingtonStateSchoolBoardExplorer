The Board of Directors conducted a Work Session on April 22, 2024, primarily focused on the 2024-2025 budget discussion. Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson provided detailed insights into budget allocations, including a forecasted need to access approximately $4 million from the Fund Balance for the 2023/24 school year and an estimated $1.8 million for 2024/25, which includes $574,000 earmarked for Nutrition Services. The board discussed the implications of staffing needs for Special Education, noting that enhanced staffing will be required for the upcoming year, although exact figures are still under review. Additionally, there was a consensus to maintain the current practice of providing basic school supplies for elementary students.

Ellingson also presented various financial charts, including cash flow projections and staffing distributions, highlighting that salaries and benefits account for 82% of the district's overall budget. The board addressed requests for increased staffing from various departments while emphasizing the importance of evaluating these requests from a risk-based perspective.
