Regular Board Meeting-7:00 a.m.
The February 5, 2024, AM Regular Board Meeting was called to order by Vice Chair David Barnes at
7:04 a.m. Others present included Board members Lupita Flores, Carlos López, and Cindy Reed,
Superintendent Mark Anderson, Director of Business & Operations Francis Badu, Director of Student
Success Mindy Schultz, and Recording Secretary Julie Notman. Board member Nikki Keller was absent.
1. Swearing-In of Re-elected Board Member: Superintendent Mark Anderson administered the Oath
of Office to returning board member Carlos López. His term runs until December 2027. No need for
board action (as noted on agenda).
2. Communication Check-In: The new district website is being loaded with info from the current
website, the go-live date may be pushed back to mid-March. The building secretaries will have the
responsibility to maintain their building’s page. In the process of looking at areas in which to make cuts,
ParentSquare will be kept as it has shown to be a successful method of communication between staff
and families. The app can be used for field trip permission forms, intersession applications, progress and
report cards, thus saving the need to print on paper. FinalForms is also under scrutiny and Skyward is
being considered as a possible replacement. The school zone warning lights by the high school are not
working properly. The county is responsible for them, is aware of the issue and is awaiting the
appropriate parts to repair them.
3. Migrant STEM Camp: This is the second year that students in the Migrant program have an
opportunity to attend a STEM camp. The purpose is to give these students access to STEM activities
that they might not get otherwise. The camp takes place during Spring Break and students in the
program are invited to attend. Cindy moved and Carlos 2nd to approve the Migrant STEM Camp request
as presented; motion carried.
4. 2024-2025 Instructional Calendar Discussion: Conversations have begun with admin and the HEA
calendar committee about intersessions and dates, and school start and end dates. Discussed intersession
value: HS likes winter and spring dates as HS students can make up credits. Grade school teachers like
the fall and spring: fall for bringing students up to par that assessed as being a bit behind after summer
break, and spring is helpful for orientation to the next grade level and/or building. The Board would like
to keep intersession for many reasons: we advocated for it, we were/are a model district for the state, we
have parental support, and now other districts are following a similar model/schedule (despite the lack
of [earmarked] funding). Basic Ed funds transportation and secretarial staff only. Discussed parental
awareness of high school credits needed for graduation and will ask to have more communication to
parents about this.
5. 2024-2025 Budget Discussion: Francis: We’ve talked for years about how the [budget] cliff was
coming and now it is here. Shared a budget status report showing revenue and expense amounts over the
past five school years (including 2023-24) and the amended projected budget status for the 2024-2025
school year. This next year’s enrollment is projected to be significantly lower as kindergarten
enrollment is down and class sizes moving up a grade are lower, the graduating class is larger. The
resulting reduced [basic ed] state funding and reduced federal funding [ESSER related] plus increased
costs add up to a significant shortfall and making up the difference from the fund balance could
potentially reduce it to 5.5%. Another chart shared showed the projected student enrollment numbers for
the next school year and teacher and para staffing options at each grade level and department were
discussed. We have 14 teachers that are provisional or in non-continuing positions. Adjusting staffing
positions and reducing staff will help close the budget shortfall but not eliminate it completely. A couple
of other specific cost-cutting areas are a freeze on new curriculum purchases and reducing extra trips.
The Board understands the situation and directed Mark and Francis to work on the budget cuts in the

areas that were discussed. A Special Meeting for further discussion, decision-making, and board
approval was set for Monday, Feb. 12.
6. Capital Projects Update: We will start the completion of the HHS/HMS HVAC system upgrade in
May-June which will mean no heat or cooling during that time but also means the system will be ready
for the 2024-2025 school year. Still looking at when to start an upgrade to the track and field.
7. Healthy Kids Grant: Francis received the good news on Friday that HSD was awarded a Healthy
Kids Grant for $190K. It will be divided between Food Service, $85K and the MWC playground
$105K.
8. Intersession Update: All is ready and on track for next week’s session. Have very engaged teachers
ready to go.
Francis and Mindy left the meeting at 9:12 a.m.
9. Superintendent Evaluation & Contract Review: The Board discussed each evaluation line item and
reviewed them with Mark. Final copy to be typed and signed at next meeting.
Adjournment: There being no further items to discuss, Vice Chair David Barnes adjourned the
February 5, 2024 AM Board Meeting at 9:40 a.m.
