Recognition

Public Content
Background Information:
We honor the first people of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of the Suquamish
Tribe of Indians.
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its Indigenous
People, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or under-served.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history, and can
demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all. It is only one small part of
supporting Indigenous communities.
The following Land Acknowledgement has been approved by the Suquamish Tribe:
We would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is within the ancestral territory of the suqabs People of
Clear Salt Water (Suquamish People). Expert fisherman, canoe builders and basket weavers, the suqabs live in harmony with the
lands and waterways along Washingtons Central Salish Sea as they have for thousands of years. Here, the suqabs live and protect
the land and waters of their ancestors for future generations as promised by the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855.

Gov. Inslee Proclaims January as School Board Recognition Month
Governor Jay Inslee has proclaimed January as School Board Recognition Month. This annual observance was initiated by the National
School Boards Association in 1995.
Its a great time to recognize our elected community members who selflessly give their time and energy in support of high-quality public
schooling for our youth. School board members in Bremerton are entrusted with the responsibility for our annual budget, our students, as
well as the more than 700 employees and 12 buildings within the District.
School boards are charged with making decisions that can sometimes be quite difficult, or require sifting through a great deal of information.
They also bear responsibility for developing a vision that will guide the school district for years to come. Through collaboration as a team,
and with school district staff, their governance and advocacy are building the future of education in Washington state.
