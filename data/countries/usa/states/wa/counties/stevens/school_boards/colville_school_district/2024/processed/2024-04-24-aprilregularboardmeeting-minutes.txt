Washington State History Field Trip
○

On April 17th, Mrs. Whitney's WA State History class took a field trip to the Steven's County
Historical Society "Keller Heritage Center." The trip aligned perfectly with the lessons in the WA
State History curriculum. The tour started with exhibits of Indigenous people of WA or Native
American artifacts and moved on to the Hudson's Bay Company and fur trappers and traders. It
also covered WWI and WWII in Stevens County. Outside, our tour guide showed us around the
mining, homestead, school house, blacksmith shop, and trappers cabin exhibits. Students
especially loved, or hated, the opportunity to go up inside the Graves Mountain Lookout Tower
which used to stand on Graves Mt. between Colville and Republic. Katie Tullen, the museum
curator, and her other volunteers were wonderful tour guides; it was very generous of them to

open the museum, especially for our class. We also had an excellent bus driver who joined right in
with our tour!

Facilities
During the first week of April (Spring Break), we rented a parking lot sweeper and cleaned all district parking lots.
Northwest Installation performed the annual inspection and service of all backboards, hoops, and bleachers. We
painted over the Indians logo on the varsity baseball concession with a base coat. The final coat of paint will be
applied when time allows. We also painted new four square courts on the Fort Colville playground.
The second week in April the Maintenance crew assisted the IT department with installing a new camera in the Aster
gym. While the lift was in the gym we ran new cable to the existing speaker in the gym, allowing communication if
needed to the class in the gym.
The third week of April we repaired parking lot lights at the Jhigh, and plan to have a new speaker system installed
in room 4 by the weeks end.
The Grounds crew are busy, as we have all of the mowers out. We have been painting, mowing, weed eating,
trimming trees and cleaning up all entry ways to all of our buildings. If the forecast holds true then we will be
turning on outside water/irrigation Monday, April 22nd.
As usual, I would like to thank the Maintenance crew for all of their work. If anyone has any questions, please feel
free to call me at 509-680-4001.
