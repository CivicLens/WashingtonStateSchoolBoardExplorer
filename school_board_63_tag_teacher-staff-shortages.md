The Blaine School District held a special board meeting on August 5, 2020 to discuss the reopening plan for the upcoming school year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger recommended a phased-in approach to returning students to classrooms, starting with remote learning and gradually introducing in-person instruction based on case statistics and community health guidelines. This recommendation was met with discussion from board members regarding concerns for student safety, equitable access to education, and the needs of families. Ultimately, the board decided to table the decision and hold another meeting on August 8th to allow for further community input and consideration.

The superintendent acknowledged that staff concerns about returning in-person had increased as the first day of school approached.  He also noted that a recent survey indicated insufficient certificated staff willing to work on campus to support the previously planned hybrid model. The board expressed a desire to balance student safety with the need for academic progress and sought to ensure families felt confident in the district's decision.
