Land Acknowledgement
We acknowledge the land we are gathering on is the traditional land of the Chemakum, and S'Klallam people. They have lived
and convened here, and taken care of the land, the water, the wildlife, and the soil since time immemorial. Many Indigenous
people still live in this place, thriving and proud.
We acknowledge that each of us has a story of our lineage and our culture. It is part of our shared humanity to be seen and
acknowledged for our stories. We are especially mindful of how the stories of the people of this place weave together and that
we lift each other up to see and be seen.

Public Content
Executive Director of Business and Finance, Kelly Liske, will join to discuss options for the upcoming 2025 EP&O Levy.
The choice may be determined by what the board thinks is most important to our community:
Overall dollar figure if this is too far off of what we have asked for in the past will that create confusion or concern with our
constituents?
$X.XX per $1,000 Are constituents focused on what it will cost them personally? They approved $0.88 per $1,000 last
time. If we ask for this, it will give us capacity for increased enrollment, but we will likely have a rollback. Would that
create confusion or are our constituentshappy we collected less than we promised?
What are we spending this money on? What are our communication challenges?
