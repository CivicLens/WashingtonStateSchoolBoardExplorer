o an overview of how counselors strive to encourage “grit” in students along
with personality traits such as persistence, determination and resilience.
During follow-up discussion, Dr. Gass referred to Derek Peterson’s presentation
at the recent NSBA (National School Board Association) annual conference in
which he discussed the importance of connectedness; i.e., a child must have a
sense that at least five adults in his life truly care about his well-being. Dr. Gass
also referred to Stanford University’s research on anti-bullying and victimization
at the high school level.
In response to an inquiry from Dr. Gass, the counselors briefly discussed the
impact of the “summer slide,” which they said could be corrected in part by
encouraging increased involvement in summer programs and appropriate
monitoring and support by adults.


Energy Efficiency Grant: Dr. Baker introduced Mike Anderson, Buildings and
Grounds Director, who discussed plans for the use of a $310,000 Energy
Efficiency Grant recently awarded by the Office of the Superintendent of Public
Instruction (OSPI).



2014-15 Budget: Dr. Baker highlighted recent developments in the budget
development process, which has involved administrators, building leadership,
staff, and labor groups. Communications and Community Relations Executive
Director Tanya Rowe and her team are preparing a springboard document and
survey that will be sent in early May to staff and families. Survey feedback will
help inform the budget process. The final draft budget will be presented to the
board for formal adoption in June.



Promise K Program: Alderwood, Carl Cozier, Happy Valley, and Roosevelt are
participating in the Promise K Program, which began April 10. Currently over 50
students are enrolled.



Administrative Hiring: Curtis Lawyer has been hired as Capital Projects
Manager. Selection of new principals at Geneva and Sunnyland elementary
schools will be announced soon. Interviews of Squalicum High School assistant
principal candidates will take place next week.



Math Curriculum: Dr. Baker updated the board on the work of the PreK-12
Math Committee. He said the committee’s work includes review and
recommendations relating to new math standards and instructional materials.
Similar work is being done around the country as districts prepare to implement
new standards.



Junior/Senior Class meetings: Meetings with high school juniors and seniors
have been scheduled in April and May, during which Dr. Baker is updating
students and requesting feedback on a variety of topics, including:
o The impact of legislative proposals relating to 1080 instructional hours
o Changes to number of days seniors attend school, so their last day of
school is consistent with the rest of the student body.
o New graduation requirements; pros and cons of moving to a seven-hour
day.

an ongoing process involving a variety of stakeholders. Discussions continue on

made.



Facilities Projects: Assistant Superintendent Ron Cowan updated the board on
the Birchwood, Happy Valley, and Lowell construction projects.

GP-6, Board Advisory Committees, and GP-6.1, Advisory Committee Structure: It
was agreed no changes are needed for these policies.
GP-10, Board Compensation and Expenses, Revised (First Reading):
 General discussion included the following comments:
o Dr. Smith referenced RCW 28A.343.400. He said consideration of this item
will follow Roberts Rules of Order and will include a first reading (this
meeting); second reading (May 8); and a third reading and vote (June 12).
o The intent of compensation is to acknowledge the costs in both time and
money of board service.
o Board members elected or reelected in 2014 or after would be eligible for
compensation.
o Board members may opt out of receiving compensation. Those requesting
compensation will submit written requests, to be approved by the board
president. Dr. Smith will create a standardized form for this purpose.
o The compensation amount would conform to RCW 28A.343.400 and would
not exceed the annual amount specified in the RCW.
o Dr. Smith said he would revise wording in the draft GP-10 to reflect
comments made at this board meeting.
o In response to a suggestion from Dr. Stockburger that the board consider
moving from the current policy of at large positions (candidates may live
anywhere in the district) to ward positions (candidates must live in designated
wards), Dr. Smith asked that proposals of this type be submitted to him in
writing for board consideration.

Ends-1 Monitoring Report, Strategic Vision and Mission
 General discussion included the following comments:
o The report shows the superintendent is effectively carrying out the district’s
vision and mission. The challenge is: how will we measure the impact? For
example, how do we determine the district’s success in empowering every
child to discover and develop a passion?
o It is commendable that everyone is speaking a common language, in terms of
The Bellingham Promise. Although families are connected to the schools at
different levels, they all hear the same message.
Board Response to the Ends-1 monitoring report will occur at the May 8, 2014
regular meeting.

BOARD RESPONSE TO MONITORING
Board Response to Monitoring Report EL-6, Academic Standards and Practices,
submitted on March 13, 2014:
 During general discussion, board members and Dr. Baker considered ways in which
direct tie-ins can be demonstrated between implementation methods described in
EL-6 and outcomes described in reports such as Ends 2, Ends 2.1, and Ends 3. It was
suggested that one or more programs might be selected (for example, Promise K,
all-day Kindergarten, or current work in reducing suspensions and expulsions) with a
description of the initial investment in relation to the outcome, which would be
measured over a period of several years. Dr. Baker suggested that selection of
specific programs to be measured could be part of the annual planning discussion at a
future board retreat.
 Following discussion, Ms. Bashaw made a motion, seconded by Dr. Gass, confirming
the following:
o The Superintendent has reasonably interpreted the provisions of EL-6; and
o there is sufficient evidence to determine whether the District is in compliance
or not; and
o the District is in compliance with the policy’s executive limitations; and
o the following comments shall be included in the Board Response to EL-6
summary sheet:

The Superintendent does a great job keeping us informed.
It has been helpful to hear more detail on what is going on
with stakeholder groups during the Superintendent’s Report at
monthly board meetings. An annual report could never capture
all the elements of what goes on during the year.

With little additional support from the State, this District is making
good headway in the Teacher and Principal Evaluation Project
(TPEP) process; Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol
(SIOP) for English Language Learner (ELL) students; Highly
Capable Learner (HCL) program; and in the curriculum areas of
math, literacy, and writing.
Motion carried unanimously.

Board Response to Monitoring Report EL-8, District Calendar
 During general discussion, board members commented on ways in which the calendar
section of the district website can be revised to enhance ease-of-use among
non-English speaking users.
 Following discussion, Ms. Hackler made a motion, seconded by Dr. Gass, that:
o The Superintendent has reasonably interpreted the provisions of EL-6; and
o there is sufficient evidence to determine whether the District is in compliance
or not; and
o the District is in compliance with the policy’s executive limitations; and
o the following comments shall be included in the Board Response to EL-8
summary sheet:
 Although the district is in compliance with our policy, it would be
beneficial to have a link on the district’s home page to a calendar in
Spanish with wording also in Spanish.
 I appreciated Dr. Baker’s comments on some of the best practices that
exist, the existing constraints to achieving them, and the thoughts
about moving forward. As the board’s expert in the field of education,
I appreciate Dr. Baker’s candor in what are existing best practices,
even if we aren’t currently practicing all of them.
Motion carried unanimously.
