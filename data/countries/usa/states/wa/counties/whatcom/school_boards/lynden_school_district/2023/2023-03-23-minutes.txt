A Bond Planning Task Force (BPTF) is being created. We sent out an invitation to the community
for applicants, and currently have 19 applicants. The deadline to apply is tomorrow at which
point the member roster will be finalized. The meeting schedule has been set with Ashley
McClaran with OAC. Timeline is with a May 3rd recommendation to the board on whether to
proceed with a bond on the ballot. Would like a student representative on the bond planning
task force as well. We are currently working with Strategies 360 to finalize a community survey.
We anticipate a that survey to go out the week of April 3rd.

The second meeting of the BPTF will be in conjunction with the LRFP. The groups will be working
