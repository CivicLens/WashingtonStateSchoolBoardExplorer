## 2024-05-02 - CHIMACUM_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The special joint board meeting of the Port Townsend School District No. 50 and Chimacum School District No. 49 on May 2, 2024, included discussions on transportation and athletic programs. Notably, the Transportation Director, Monica Mulligan, recommended a change in the bell schedule for Port Townsend schools for the 2025-26 school year to improve efficiency and reduce ride times for younger students. The proposal involves reversing the afternoon pick-up order, which would require further consideration by students, staff, and families before a decision is made. Additionally, the boards approved the Athletic Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for both districts, emphasizing a purpose-based athletic program aimed at developing better human qualities in athletes rather than solely focusing on winning. The meeting also addressed the ongoing challenges of transportation recruitment and the need for improved collaboration between the two districts' Athletic and Student Body Associations (ASBs).
