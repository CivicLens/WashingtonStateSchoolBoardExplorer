Public Content
Information:
Dedication of Right of Way along both property frontages on Oak Road and 18th Avenue West to
Snohomish County for Oak Heights Elementary School Replacement Project shall provide adequate
width for 1-ft clearance behind the proposed sidewalk.
Background:
As part of the permitting for the Oak Heights Elementary Replacement project, Snohomish County is
requiring the School District construct a new concrete sidewalk, curb and gutter along the West side of
its entire 18th Ave. W. and North side of its entire Oak Road frontages. In conjunction with these
frontage improvement requirements, County staff is requesting that the School District dedicate a
narrow strip of property along both property frontages. This strip of property extends approximately
635.70 feet from the northern end of the Oak Heights Elementary School property to the southern edge
of the curved intersection with Oak Road, 39.77 feet along the curve, then from the intersection west
along Oak Road to the western end of the Oak Heights Property approximately 454.50 feet. The
requested dedication would total 3,379 square feet. For comparison, the Oak Heights Elementary
School site is approximately 381,907 square feet. (See attached graphic).
The purpose of this dedication would be to locate the new sidewalk entirely within the public right of way.
This arrangement would reduce the School Districts liability. The amount of property dedicated varies
because Oak Road does not have a uniform width and contains a curve.
The CPO staff believe that the requested dedication is in the best interest of all parties. CPO staff have
reviewed this matter with legal counsel, who advises that this dedication is appropriate.

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the
attached Easement Agreement for pole relocation onto
school property (CPE), on the east side of the sidewalk
along 76th Ave. W.

Public Content
Information:
Per City of Lynnwood requirements, the Ziply Fiber pole must be relocated onto school property at
College Place Elementary.
Background:
At its August 29, 2023 regular meeting, the School Board approved the Temporary Construction
Easement Agreement with City of Lynnwood for the 204th Street SW Right-of-Way improvements. As
part of their project, the City of Lynnwood will be upgrading sidewalks and curb cuts. The existing Ziply
Fiber pole sits within the sidewalk close to the curb, and City standards require poles to be placed outside
of sidewalks for pedestrian safety.
Ziply Fiber contacted the Capital Projects office to request the attached easement for the relocated pole.
The easement allows Ziply to enter District property to maintain their pole that is shared with our network
carrier, Astound. This relocation is consistent with City of Lynnwood standards and will not diminish
College Place Elementary Schools use of the school site, and preserves District trees along 76th Ave. W.
