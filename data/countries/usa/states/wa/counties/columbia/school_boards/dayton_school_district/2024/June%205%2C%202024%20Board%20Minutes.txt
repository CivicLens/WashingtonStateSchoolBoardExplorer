3. Discussion Items
A. Topic 1 - Budget Hearing
Business Manager Jana Eaton shared a power-point presentation giving an overview of the 2024-2025 budget. The overview
included descriptions of each of the funds, the expected revenue and expenditures for each of the funds and the MSOC
disclosure information as required by OSPI. The official budget adoption will be on June 19th.
B. Topic 2 - Facilities Plan
Superintendent Stewart gave an overview of the projects planned over the next four years with the capital levy funds.
Maintenance supervisor John Delp has been working on getting bids for the projects. This summer the district plans to move
forward with the fencing, some of the concrete work and possibly the underground sprinklers. Pruitt Flooring walked through
the gym today and has some ideas for fixing the dead spots to be able to get the current floor to last for a few more years.
We also need to add more door security, cameras and add security at the athletic complex. We also need to fix the ventilation
system in the high school building. All of the ventilators on the roof have failed. Board member Griffen asked for a priority list
and for quotes and project proposals before the projects begin. Mr. Griffen also would like to see updates on the projects at
each of the work sessions and would like to make sure there are not too many projects going at the same time which could
lead to running out of funds if there are overages in one of the project areas. Mr. Delp stated he is working on getting at least
three quotes for each of the proposed projects. Robust discussion ensued on projects and how they will be carried out, the
bidding process, and making sure the board is well informed on what the district is doing with the levy funds.
Superintendent Stewart shared the fall and spring scores in math and reading which show an increased growth between fall
and spring scores. We have focused on reading this year and have seen a lot of improvement with the intensive supports
offered this year in the elementary.
4. Adjournment
Board Chair McCowen adjourned the meeting at 8:15 p.m. The next meeting will be on June 19, 2024 at 6:30 p.m. in the high
school media center.
Respectfully submitted,

Rich Stewart, Secretary to the Board of Directors
