Recommended Action :

By motion, ratify Amendment No. 2 to a Water Quality
Combined Financial Assistance Agreement between the
City of Pullman and the Washington State Department of
Ecology for the Decant Facility Project.

Public Content
The City Council previously authorized the execution of a Washington State
Department of Ecology (DOE) agreement via Resolution R-20-20 for the design and
construction of a Decant Facility. Last December, via R-71-22, the City Council
authorized an amendment to the agreement titled Amendment No. 1. Said
amendment converted the agreement to design only, so that staff could apply for a
new grant to fund construction of the Decant Facility using current cost estimates, as
the original agreement did not have sufficient construction dollars for the project to
move forward.
Amendment No. 1 modified the grant by adding a new task and funds to complete an
Enhanced Maintenance Plan submittal to DOE as part of the agreement. This new
deliverable is necessary for the City to be eligible for a separate construction grant to
fund construction of the project.
The current DOE agreement has an expiration date of December 31, 2023. During
development of the Enhanced Maintenance Plan, it became apparent that additional
time would be needed to complete this deliverable. This was based primarily on
communication with DOE staff in November. As a result, staff sent the attached
request to DOE to extend the grant expiration date from December 31, 2023 to June
30, 2024. DOE agreed to this request. Amendment No. 2 was subsequently prepared
by DOE and sent to City staff on December 26, 2023for execution. Given the
impeding agreement deadline, and in the interest of time, the Mayor executed the
Amendment on December 26, 2023. Staff is seeking Council ratification of the
execution of said Amendment No. 2, which is attached for your reference.
In summary, Amendment No. 2 only changed the deadline of the agreement, and
there were no other changes.

Public Content

Council authorized applications for two capital grants (one via resolution R-63-22 on October 18,
2022 and the other via consent agenda motion on January 10, 2023) in which staff requested
state and federal assistance to purchase three electric buses. The buses were intended to be
shorter, more suited to neighborhood travel and future airport service. Both grants were based
on a price quote from Schetky Bus & Van Sales, for a View coach-style bus by Hometown
Coach.Staff received notice from WSDOT of award for both capital grants in spring 2023.
However, the vendornotified staff that there were significant pricing increases over our quotes
last year, as well as a loss of interest on the part of Hometown to have their electric buses
Altoona tested, a requirement for state and federal grant funding.Staff consulted with the City
Attorney, and determined that the October 2022 quote was unenforceable, and the
unwillingness of the manufacturer to accomplish required Altoona testing has removed the bus
from consideration for grant funding.
Staff made contact with four vendors in summer 2023 to determine what products they offer as
electric coach-style buses, less than 30 feet in length, and available on Washington state
purchasing contract 06719. Staff quickly learned that electric coach-style buses under 30 feet
were generally unavailable. Staff then revised the request to include buses up to 30 feet in
length. Our longtime bus vendor, Gillig, does not produce electric vehicles under 35-feet in
length. Products available from these vendors were mostly gas, diesel, or not qualified for
eligibility via the state's purchasing contract. However,BYD Coach & Bus offers a 30-foot coach
bus that is on the Washington state purchasing contract as electric, and has been successfully
Altoona-tested. This model is part of the fleet at nearby Link Transit in Wenatchee. The vendor
arranged to bring one of the buses from Wenatchee to Pullman in October 2023 for inspection
and road testing. Staff requested a quote from BYD (Exhibit A), which includes thecharger and
both the video and AVL/GPS systems.
Although more expensive than the original Schetky quotes, staff find the bus and options offered
by BYD Coach & Bus as the best and only path forward in using available grant-funds to assist
with the purchase of three electric buses. Transit does not use the amortization approach for
capital replacement, but rather builds a cash reserve fund primarily for grant matching. The
reserve fund is currently around $6.48M. Transit staff adjust the ongoing capital replacement
approach via the ongoing CIP process, updating the frequency and volume of buses based on
available grant and reserve funding. The pending spring Transit CIP will include these buses for
early 2025 delivery.
The request is to approve the motion, authorizing purchase of three electric buses from BYD
Coach and Bus, via state purchasing contract 06719, with both grant assistance and Transit
reserve cash funds.

Recommended Action :

A motion to authorize the amendment of the existing
contract by one year, including a Maintenance Service
Plan, to continue support of Pullman Transit's CAD/AVL
system.

Public Content
Pullman Transit has had a fixed route CAD/AVL/GPS and passenger counting system
on its buses since at least 2011. This system allows staff to schedule routes on set
frequencies, see the bus locations on screen, and automatically count passengers at
the door.As a result, the public can also track their bus locations and next stop times,
as well as see how full the approaching bus is.
The contract for the associated current hardware, software, and annual fees was
awarded via an RFP process to Syncromatics (now GMV Innovating Solutions) in
2017. Because the system continues to work well, and the City now owns the
hardware, staff prefers to continue the contract via annually paid service fees only,
with an annual maintenance service plan.
The proposed contract amendment, and associated annual quote, are attached as
Exhibit A. Staff requests approval to continue the service through 2024.

Recommended Action :

By motion, adopt the North Arterial Technical
Memorandum and providing for other matters properly
related thereto.

Public Content
In the early 1970s the Washington State Highway Commission, now known as the
Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) acquired right-of-way (r/w)
and access control for a North Bypass, designated as State Route (SR) 276. This
route was envisioned as a divided limited access highway,proposed primarily to
relieve congestion in the downtown business district where two state highways, SR
27 and SR 270, intersect. This route begins at U.S. Route 195, north of Pullman, and
terminates at SR 270, east of Pullman. When WSDOT purchased the right of way,
they also purchased these limited access rights. The purchase was done with Federal
and State motor vehicle funds; therefore, the r/w can only be used for road and street
purposes.

In 2016, Senate Bill 6607 was introduced in the Washington State Legislature to
decommission the unbuilt highway by removing its designation from the Revised
Code of Washington, thereby ending the states plan to one day construct the North
Bypass. In addition, the portion of r/w between Airport Road and SR 270, was
modified and sold to the Pullman Moscow Regional Airport (PMRA) to facilitate their
runway expansion project.
Later in 2016, WSDOT contacted both the City and Whitman County, indicating that
they would like to transfer the r/w to the City/County at no cost, with the caveat that
the r/w must be used for road and street purposes only. At that point, the City and
County agreed that the best course of action was to first hire a Consultant to study
and determine what a City/County arterial street (North Arterial) would look like within
this corridor and determine what else should be considered if the r/w was to be
acquired. At their November 22, 2016 meeting, City Council authorized City staff to
take the lead on this effort by authorizing an Engineering Services Agreement with
Parametrix, Inc. to perform the engineering study. The final draft of that study was
presented to City Council on November 28, 2023 in the form of a North Arterial
Technical Memorandum. A presentation was also made to Whitman County on
November 20th, 2023.
No changes were requested to the study by either the City Council or by Whitman
County at said meetings. Therefore, the study is now being brought to Council for
formal adoption.
The study determined that the right-of-way is acceptable for a City/County arterial
street and recommends that both the City and County move forward with acquiring
the right-of-way from WSDOT. Prior to right-of-way acquisition, the study also
recommends that WSDOT releases the existing limited access rights, as they are no
longer applicable to a City/County street. The study identified some areas where
additional r/w and construction easements will be necessary. These areas shall be
preserved for the purpose of the eventual North Arterial construction.
Staff recommends that Council adopt the North Arterial Technical Memorandum and
also authorize staff to begin working with WSDOT to acquire the right-of-way. Any
subsequent right-of-way agreements with WSDOT will be brought to Council for their
acceptance.

The construction of the Sunnyside Heights Subdivision No. 13 required construction
of a public stormwater detention and treatment facility and appurtenances which are
located outside the limits of the platted subdivision. Therefore an easement was
required of the property owner for the ongoing maintenance and operation of this
public utility. The easement has been prepared and executed by the property owner,
Itani Land Company, LLC, and is offered for Council acceptance. The easement will
then be recorded with Whitman County.

If the Council believes more input from the Planning Commission is warranted,
remand the case to the Commission. If the case is remanded, the Council must
specify the time within which the Commission shall report back its findings and
recommendations to the Council.
If the Council wishes to consider any change to the Planning Commission
recommendation and does not wish to remand the case, revise the proposed
Council accordingly.
If the Council decides to accept the Planning Commission recommendation,
approve the attached Council ordinance.

Recommended Action :

By motion, adopt the attached resolution approving the final
plat of Sunnyside Heights Subdivision No. 13 and
authorizing the Mayor, and Finance and Administrative
Services Director to sign the final plat.

Public Content
The preliminary plat for Sunnyside Height Subdivision No. 13 was for the division
of approximately 10.8 acres into 35 lots and public streets. This subdivision is
located southwest of Sunnyside Park, north of Center Street and east of Windy
Point Court. Please see the attached Exhibit 1 for the location map of this
preliminary plat. The preliminary plat for this property was approved with sixteen
(16) conditions by Council Resolution, R-28-21, on April 29, 2021. All applicable
construction and design conditions are being satisfied with this plat and the
construction of related improvements. Condition No. 16, a new and unique plat
name and number, was not enforced due to the preliminary plat being approved as
Sunnyside Heights No. 13.
The developer is choosing to final plat this property in phases. This, the first
phase, Sunnyside Heights Subdivision No. 13, includes 6.4 acres with twenty (20)
building lots, one (1) non-buildable lot dedicated to the City of Pullman for
stormwater utilities, and a continuation of Panorama Drive. The future second
phase, presumed to be Sunnyside Heights Subdivision No. 14, shall include 4.4
acres with fifteen (15) building lots, and the continuation of Panorama Drive to its
point of connection with the existing Panorama Drive being a part of Whispering
Hills Subdivision No. 8.
To guarantee the construction of improvements for Sunnyside Heights Subdivision
No. 13 and to appropriately warrant the maintenance of improvements, the
developer has been notified of the security that will be required. A copy of that
Letter of Direction is attached for reference. This Subdivision was vested in 2021
at the time of the preliminary plat and therefore the developer falls under the 2018

Pullman design standards which change the time limit to construct all subdivision
sidewalks from three years to one year.
This Council item aligns with the Councils adopted Goals and Priorities, and with
the 2021 Comprehensive Plan.

Through WaterSMART (Sustain and Manage Americas Resources for Tomorrow),
the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation provides financial assistance for projects that
conserve and use water more efficiently, implement renewable energy, investigate
and develop water marketing strategies, mitigate risk of future water conflict, and
accomplish other benefits that contribute to sustainability in the western United
States. WaterSMART Water and Energy Efficiency Grants focus on projects that
result in quantifiable and sustained water savings, and replacing existing meters with
Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) technology is one of the eligible water-saving
project types.

The City has been planning a citywide upgrade to AMI technology, and the project is
in the Capital Improvement Program (CIP), planned to be partially grant-funded.
Advanced Metering Infrastructure provides a fully interconnected system giving realtime water usage data to staff and customers, as opposed to once-a-month readings.
This will lead to more accurate water billing and significant water conservation
through timely leak detection as well as customer awareness. This is an essential
part of the City's efforts to stabilize the regions precious water supply from the
Grande Ronde Aquifer, and will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle
miles driven for meter reads and by increasing energy efficiency of the water system.
The Notice of Funding Opportunity for the latest cycle of the WaterSMART grant was
posted on November 14, 2023, and the closing date for Fiscal Year 2024 applications
is February 22, 2024. The grant requires a 50% cost share of the total project cost.
Selections are expected to be announced this summer, followed by an anticipated
award date of December 31, 2024. The Bureau of Reclamation expects to choose
approximately 40-50 projects for grant awards for this application period. The grant
has different funding levels, with a maximum award ceiling of $5,000,000 per
agreement for projects that may take up to 3 years to complete.
At the time of the City's last grant application in July 2022, the total project cost was
estimated at $3.5 million dollars. Staff feels that this opportunity is worth pursuing to
leverage existing CIP funds and share half of this planned projects cost with federal
funds. Grant funding will allow the City to hire a contractor to install the devices to
complete the project in a much timelier manner than using in-house resources that
are experiencing capacity issues.
Staff is currently planning to pursue this grant opportunity, and proposes to bring forth
the draft application to City Council for authorization on the Consent Agenda at their
February 13thCouncil meeting, ahead of the grant submission deadline of February 22
ndif so directed. Staff has unsuccessfully applied for this grant twice before, but
received valuable feedback and reinforced the project with lots of attention and work
being contributed by Public Works Director Sean Wells, Maintenance & Operations
Supervisor Art Garro, Deputy Public Works Director Clayton Forsmann, Development
Engineer Scott Palmer, and Grants & Special Projects Manager Valerie Weaver.
Staff is requesting input and direction from City Council regarding staffs proposed
plan to apply for the WaterSMART Water and Energy Efficiency (FY 2024) grant.

In 2021, aCity Council goal was to modernize boards, commissions, and committees.
From that original goal-setting meeting, the discussion included the order of the City
Council agenda.
Emails to City Council were sent on:
October 15, 2021
January 20, 2022
April 28, 2023
January 3, 2024
These emails included sample agendas from eight different cities to demonstrate a
variety of meeting structures.
There has been renewed interest over the last couple of months on this matter. This
agenda item has been created for City Council discussion around this topic.
