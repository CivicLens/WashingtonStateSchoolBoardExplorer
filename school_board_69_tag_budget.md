# Meeting Summaries for HIGHLAND_SCHOOL_DISTRICT with Tag: budget

## 2024-02-12 - HIGHLAND_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Highland School District #203 convened a Special Board Meeting on February 12, 2024, to discuss significant changes to the 2024-2025 instructional calendar and budget. The proposed instructional calendar includes a reduction of the winter intersession to one day for high school credit retrieval, while the spring intersession is scheduled for May 5-9, contingent on snow make-up days. The last day of school is set for June 18, 2024, with the Juneteenth holiday following. The board supports this calendar draft, which will be reviewed by administration and the calendar committee before seeking final approval in March.

In terms of budgeting, the district is facing declining enrollment, with a projected loss of 80 Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) by 2025-2026. This has necessitated staffing cuts, including the elimination of a certificated position at HHS and a reduction in classified staff, specifically a RIF of one position and two para positions. The budget projections indicate a net gain of $346K after proposed cuts, but the fund balance will remain below desired levels. The board supports the proposed budget and staffing changes, acknowledging the need to address financial challenges amid declining enrollment and reduced state funding.
