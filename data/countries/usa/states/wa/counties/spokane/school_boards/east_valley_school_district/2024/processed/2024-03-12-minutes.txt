6.1 Superintendent Report
Mr. Talbott discussed the potential use of the Mountainview Middle School quadplex ballfields to be used by the Spokane Valley/Liberty Lake Little League (SV/LLLL). Though Brian still needs to speak with the neighbors around Mountainview, he and the team will begin discussions to determine the next steps between the district and SV/LLLL. Mr. Talbott also discussed the Highly Capable program. In year's past OSPI required approval of the Board to be reflected in the minutes. Though, this was not a requirement this year, Brian informed the Board that the Highly Capable program is identical to that which was approved in the previous year.
