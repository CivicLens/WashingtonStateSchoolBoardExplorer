Explanation of Issue:
Bellingham Public Schools uses Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), Long Distance, and larger
capacity services (ISDN) to provide inbound and outbound phone and fax services to school and
administrative sites. These services have been provided under a multi-year contract. New
proposals were solicited this year to renew services, ensure qualification for potential discounting
through E-rate, and validate best pricing.
Three responding carriers (Century Link, Integra Telecom [Electric Lightwave], and Wave Cable)
were evaluated. The lowest priced responsive proposal was received from the incumbent vendor,
Integra Telecom. Their proposal value ($3,133.46 per month) excluded state, local and federal
taxes, fees, variable long distance billing, or other surcharges. Inclusive of mandatory taxes, fees
and long distance services, a total average monthly billing of $8,324.76 is typical for services
under this agreement.
