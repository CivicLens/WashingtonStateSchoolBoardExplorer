A. Review of WSSDA Board Self Assessment Survey with WSSDA Facilitator Mary Fertakis
Superintendent Wheatley introduced Mary Fertakis and Heather Curl from WSSDA to go over the school board self-assessment survey results. Board members completed a self assessment survey last month. Previous board members have taken this same survey which gives Dayton some baseline data. Board members have copies of the survey and the scoring tool. Ms. Fertakis opened with an ice-breaker exercise asking board members for one word or phrase to describe their motivation for being here and serving students and what they would like to accomplish this year for students.  Over the two hour session the board worked on different goals and focus areas by breaking into small groups and working on specific topics. Ms. Fertakis will send the document with the completed comments for the board review in a future workshop. In closing, the board summed up their feelings on the workshop with very positive and inspirational comments.
  4. Adjournment
Board member McCowen adjourned the meeting at 8:34 p.m. The next meeting will be a regular board meeting on November 20, 2024 at 6:30 p.m. in the high school media center and via Zoom.
