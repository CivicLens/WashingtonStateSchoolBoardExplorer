Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors to approve the contract for the
district stadium scoreboard replacement utilizing the
KCDA Purchasing Cooperative.

Public Content
Presenter:
Kevin Jolma
Executive Director of Facilities
Background:
This KCDA/ Daktronics contract of $213,789.96 (including sales tax) is for the replacement of the existing scoreboard. This new
video display scoreboard will replace the existing scoreboard that was installed in 2009. The existing scoreboard is a very simple
electronic sign that has been rebuilt in the past and has served its useful life.
The new scoreboard will be a video display model that is far more advanced than the older standard electronic signs which
simply show digital numbers. This scoreboard will allow for video display during events and it is fundamentally a 12 feet by 18
feet video screen akin to a high resolution flat screen television.
The new scoreboard is a modular based design and waterproof. The 12 x 18 screen is made up of smaller individual LED
modules. If an individual module fails it can be easily replaced by spares that we will keep on hand. The new board will allow for
greater flexibility at any event. For example, it could be used for hosting movie nights or during graduations the screen could be
used to project names and faces.

This contract includes: demolition and disposal of the existing board; modifications to the existing support structure to mount the
new board; cleaning and painting the support structure; as well as the labor and material to install the new board. The sign was
sized so as to allow the reuse of the existing foundations and supports thereby saving many thousands of dollars.
This project is levy funded.
