Guideline for Public Comment:
The White Salmon Valley School District Board of Directors requests comments be limited to four (4)
minutes per speaker. Speakers will state their name and county of residence for the record. The Board
appreciates community members sharing information during public comments. While the Board does not
respond to public comment, following the meeting, the Chair, Vice Chair, and Superintendent will together
determine the appropriate level response. Speakers may offer objective criticism of district operations or
programs but the Board will not hear complaints concerning specific district personnel. If public comment
exceeds 20 minutes, and speakers are unable to make public comments to the Board, please submit
your public comment by email to wsvsd.board@whitesalmonschools.org and it will be reviewed by the
Board Chair and Superintendent.
