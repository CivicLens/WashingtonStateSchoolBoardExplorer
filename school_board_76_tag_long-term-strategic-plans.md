The Special Work Session Meeting held on July 18, 2024, focused on significant policy changes and long-term strategic planning for the district.

To address this financial shortfall, Lewis is coordinating with Trisha Schock, NCESD Assistant Superintendent, and Mitchell Thompson, MLSD Executive Director of Finance and Operations, in upcoming meetings with the MLEA bargaining team scheduled for late July and early August.
