INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
Annual Affirmative Action Progress Report – general review.
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Mason shared that today was her last day as the parent of an elementary student,
as her daughter will be moving on to middle school in the fall. She commended the
district’s communications team for their coordination of graduation and the retirement
dinner. At the board’s visit to Wade King Elementary, she enjoyed hearing about the
Roots of Empathy program. She appreciates the level of inclusion offered that the
district offers students.
• Mr. Ritchey noted that a theme he’s seen over the last month is community as action.
At the community linkage at the Bellingham Family Partnership Program (BFPP), he
saw how intentional the program has been to create community within a community.
At the Wade King Elementary visit, it was powerful to watch and exciting to learn
about the Roots of Empathy program. Last week’s attack on a student demonstrates
how important it is for a community to define acceptable versus unacceptable
behavior. He was grateful for the opportunity to participate as a school board
representative in a graduation ceremony over the weekend.
• Ms. Rose shared that she and Mr. Ritchey, as a board sub-committee, have been
looking at the board’s self-assessment structure. They have identified four
dimensions: planning and preparation, meeting conduct (inclusive and effective),

transparency and consistency with policy governance. They will do some additional
research so the topic can be discussed at the board’s summer retreat. During the visit
to the BFPP, she appreciated hearing that the program offers opportunities for
students as well as teachers who have found it to be challenging to work within the
guidelines of a typical school’s structure. She was encouraged that the middle school
student who was attacked last week felt safe enough to return to school the following
day.
Ms. Diaz Hackler remarked that the retirement dinner is one of her favorite events
each year. She was sorry to miss the visit to Wade King Elementary. She attended the
fifth-grade track meet and the Community Transitions graduation, which was a
beautiful event.
Mr. Benjamin shared that he loves hearing the reflections of the board members each
month. He recently spent a day in Spokane at a WSSDA directors’ meeting, which
was attended by the president of the National School Board Association (NSBA).
There appears to be solid support for WSSDA to continue its affiliation with the
NSBA. He enjoyed seeing how the BFPP has matured over the past several years.
The retirement dinner was great. He attended the final IB interview for Roosevelt
Elementary School a couple weeks ago. There were a lot of questions from the IB
evaluators, and they were surprised that the board had learned about the IB program
from visiting schools. The graduation ceremonies were impressive.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The report shows active progress in developing academic practices and standards that meet policy
expectations, as the Board has come to expect from this superintendent and his team. Some
notable examples of commendable efforts include, but are not limited to: expanded inclusionary
efforts, more focus on behaviorally dysregulated students and mental health supports, use of AI
tools, new math curriculums, alignment with Board ends, STI integration, expanding IB schools
and broad stakeholder involvement. The board is impressed with the work done on coming up
with a new inclusion definition. It seems like a lot of work went into it. The board is also
impressed with the professional development on artificial intelligence. It’s a new and growing
field and staying on top of current trends is very smart. More impressive work has been done
towards improving the Since Time Immemorial standards. Getting the outdoor learning grant to
expand the salmon release, the storytelling pathway and Treaty Day are all very important things.
The new definition of inclusion is an excellent framework for fully realizing the value of
inclusion for all students and the community at large. This definition really underscores the
positive network effects of inclusion and is commendable as an expression of equity and impact
for all students. The thoughtful alignment of professional learning and district-wide goals, as well
as the significant variety of professional learning course offerings, is a commendable
demonstration of the district’s commitment to ongoing improvement in instructional innovation.
The report demonstrates clear alignment with board ends, in addition to meeting other criteria and
needs.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The report shows that the superintendent has developed a robust process over the years to build
the district calendar consistent with policy. This year is no exception with broad involvement of
stakeholders, attention to evolving holidays, bargaining changes, enhanced professional
development, family engagement and broad communication strategies. The district calendar is
important to so many people. The board feels that Dr. Baker always does such a thorough job in
involving many groups, as requested by the board. Good job keeping the calendar (and families)
up to date when it changes, like after inclement weather. The district’s important commitment to
professional learning is reflected in the adjusted calendar dates for early dismissal. Developing
these opportunities for collaboration and growth are valuable as schools continue to respond to
changes in education, society and technology. Many families are understandably challenged by
the need for these early releases, but the district’s work to develop and communicate the
calendars proactively and effectively is commendable. The district calendar is a key example of
the many needs and priorities of the myriad stakeholders the district serves. Creating a calendar
designed to thoughtfully meet such a range of almost contradictory needs is commendable,
particularly as it also so clearly reflects the values of The Bellingham Promise. Appreciate the
continued support of multiple channels of communication and opportunities for families to
engage. The snow day approach is a perfect example of the thoughtful intention behind
scheduling and communications and demonstrates the district/superintendent’s understanding of
the role the district plays in the community at large.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
There is evidence of modest gap closure with Hispanic/Latinx and low-income groups. There
have been significant increases in dual credit and CTE participation, particularly among female
students. The growth particularly in CTE participation and offerings is impressive. Despite the
difficulties students had during the pandemic, it seems hopeful that dropout rates seem similar to
pre-pandemic. Our overall district graduation rates have improved over the past 10 years beyond
state averages and made important progress towards the rates reflected from the high bar peer
districts. This progress is commendable. Bellingham’s very strong graduation rates for students
with disabilities at seven years reflects the values of The Bellingham Promise and illustrates our
district’s impressive commitment to transitioning students effectively to life after public schools.
The 90% graduation rate is especially commendable. Our progress in closing the gap for lowincome vs. non-low-income students’ five-year graduation rates are evident from the data
provided; the progress is commendable. The notable increase in CTE dual credit is an impressive
reflection of the district’s investment in and dedication to the CTE programs and is a
commendable outcome. The breadth of programs offered is impressive and will directly help
support engaging student interest and belonging with applied knowledge and learning
opportunities.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
The graduation gap with multilingual learners increased, though it is recognized these numbers
fluctuate significantly. The report indicates that income is perhaps the most significant contributor
to graduation rate gaps. Our interpretation of the testing impacts to grade 10 students is that these
anomalous scores may be the result of COVID era effects due to reduced student familiarity with
the standardized tests and a lack of understanding for the use of these standardized test scores
specific to this cycle of measurement. We were glad to learn that we will likely see improvement
in this area in future cycles. Our district stands out for our strong focus on proficiency gaps and
the district team’s efforts to close these gaps. We would anticipate continued progress in this area
as we see reduced COVID era effects and with the efforts already underway and would like to
voice support for the importance of these continued efforts.
4. Comments on the report itself.
Appreciate blending the data sets with the report narrative, makes for a much smoother read.
Great report, as always. This is an exceptionally rich and transparent report on key outcomes
related to The Bellingham Promise. The integrated data set makes it much easier to see. This
report is always great – thorough and clear.

Great to see Latinos in Action leading assemblies at all high schools and how that class is so
successful in its work.
Heartwarming stories of being principled at Northern Heights (and across the district).
The explicit teaching of pro-social thought and self regulation is a commendable example of
the tactical efforts required to advance the broader goals of the Promise.
The tremendous commitment to improving educational equity is evident in the Columbia
elementary example provided and other district activities where teaching staff have committed
to improving differentiation and redesigning their practices to be more effective for all
students. These efforts are commendable for their creativity and drive towards continuous
improvement.
District growth in reading, based on the i-ready report shows commendable growth and
achievement broadly.
The option for middle school compacted math is a good example of providing additional
challenge to students interested and motivated to do so. The use of online tools is a
commendable creative complement to in-class instruction within the budget constraints of the
system.
The district commitment to helping students engage through inquiry complex topics with
multiple developing skills is outstanding and the work on identity, compassion, and historical
understanding of tribal sovereignty is commendable.
The 5th grade strings program is an example of Bellingham leadership in music education and
a commendable commitment of the district and community to outstanding depth in this effort.
Overall, it’s inspiring and humbling to see The Bellingham Promise at the core of the
Bellingham Public Schools at seemingly every level – from the day-to-day, to leadership,
curriculum, etc.
Appreciate strength of seven year graduation rate.

• While an issue across the State as a result of COVID, will be interested to see how attendance
rates can be improved over the coming years.
SR:
• While real challenges exist and efforts have been made to facilitate continuity in music
education through middle school, the district has opportunity to continue consideration of
creative approaches that support students with simultaneous interests in topics currently
covered by electives.

• While there are obvious broader issues at play, would like to see attendance rates reflect at
least the state average.

Would love to see the music and arts bottleneck that happens in middle school shift. While
there are known challenges in making this happen, the current structure disincentivizes
participation in the arts at that level – a time that’s so crucial for developing a lifelong
appreciation for the experience of creativity.

• Appreciate focusing on a single school (Columbia) as an example, as well as a plethora of
other specific examples, particularly regarding knowledge and character outcomes. This helps
get a sense of the broad scope of the work.

• Great report, as always!
JM:
• There’s truly too much in this report to highlight all of the ways that the goals are being met
(this is a good thing!).
