before the start of school in August.

b. 2024-2025 Produce Recommendation: Francis: We are part of the West Valley co-op but also
because of the amount we spend we must advertise for bids if we want to have the option of purchasing

submission was scored and we recommend awarding them a contract. Lupita moved to award a Produce
contract to Waldman’s, Cindy 2nd; motion carried.

c. Budget Status /Enrollment and Operations Report: Francis: We have had several budget
discussions throughout the past year. There are still some things we need to replenish, such as laptops,
which is why we were conserving so we could buy what we need. At the end of June the GF was $1.39M
compared to $1.16M a year ago. Mark: We will track enrollment again this coming year and if we keep
our spending down and follow through with year two cuts as planned it should get us to where we need to
be. It was a challenging year but we were able to reach our objective and we feel good about that.
i. Personnel Report: Mark: You can see we have some new hires and most [certificated] positions are
filled. We will hold interviews in early August for the open para positions. The [certificated] position
we’re still hoping to fill is the SLP but it will be a challenge to find someone so it will probably be
covered by a remote provider. We are glad to have an on-site psych. The recommendations to fill the new
director positions created to consolidate staff/positions will be ready next month. Lupita moved with 2nd
by Carlos to approve the July Personnel Report as presented; motion carried.
f. Legislative Report: Cindy: Not a report but an FYI: Initiative 2081, known as the Parents’ Bill of
Rights, was passed by the legislature, but on June 21, a preliminary injunction against it was allowed by a
Seattle Superior Court Judge, so it is on hold.
g. Payment of Bills-General, ASB, Capital Projects, and Payroll: Cindy moved to pay the General
Fund, ASB, Capital Projects, and Payroll as presented, Carlos 2nd; motion passed.
• General Fund bills for $226,560.46 with warrants 78481 through 78567.
