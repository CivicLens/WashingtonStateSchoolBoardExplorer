3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E--> Please consider keeping the high school pool out of the budget cuts. It does so much good for the
community. The swim team provides kids with a healthy outlet, swimming lessons help our kids in a town where the lake is a main hub of
activity, it provides high-school students with lifeguard training and jobs, and opportunities for the community to have a safe and less
strenuous way to exercise. I feel cutting their portion of the budget will only be a disadvantage to our schools, students, and community.
Devin Deitrick--<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23cccccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%
3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E--> Dear Members of the MLSD School Board and Administration,
I hope this message finds you well. As a concerned member of the community, I feel compelled to express my unwavering support for
Christine Armstrong, Director of CBTECH, amidst recent developments.
Christine's dedication to her students and staff at CBTECH has been nothing short of exemplary. Her tireless efforts to foster a nurturing
learning environment and advocate for the well-being of all involved reflect her profound commitment to educational excellence.
The decision to place Christine on administrative leave solely due to her remarks, which were both professional and respectful, is deeply
troubling. It is disheartening to witness punitive actions taken against an individual who dared to voice legitimate concerns within the
confines of decorum and professionalism.
Furthermore, the exorbitant expenditure of $450 per hour to engage Richard Keiser, an external legal counsel from Bellevue, WA, for the
investigation at hand raises serious questions about fiscal responsibility and prudent resource allocation. At a time when educational budgets
are already under strain, such lavish spending on legal fees is simply unjustifiable.
It is imperative that the School Board and Administration reassess their approach to addressing dissenting voices within the district. Instead of
punitive measures, constructive dialogue and collaboration should be embraced as the cornerstone of fostering a harmonious and inclusive
educational community.
In conclusion, I urge the School Board and Administration to reconsider their actions and reinstate Christine Armstrong, recognizing her
invaluable contributions to CBTECH and the broader educational landscape. Let us uphold the principles of fairness, accountability, and
respect for diverse perspectives as we collectively strive towards a brighter future for all stakeholders.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,Devin Deitrick

3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E--> Why don't you ask classified staff who wouldn't mind being let go to receive unemployment. Who
wouldn't mind having hours cut, who wouldn't mind retiring early. Then once that information is collected, using that to calculating the rest of
staff that has to be riffed.
These are families, people who have children. Medical problems, cancer.. human beings. How would you feel if this was you?
Todd Hoffer--<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23cccccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%
3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E--> The district has done the absolute opposite of what they said in board meetings for RIF notices.
Monty can not be trusted and needs terminated immediately on ground of poor management, lack of financial oversight, and withholding
information from the board about the actual financial situation, by over staffing for so many years and using reserve funds to cover those
overages. Terminate now! Or better, let the district go into bankruptcy and let the state come in and handle this mess.

3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->I have been very vocal that Super and COO should be held accountable for their significant and
serious financial mismanagement of the school district. I would also like to call HR professionals into this discussion that they have been able
to hire incompetent professionals over and over again. They should be held just as accountable as Super and COO for hiring these people. We
have better individuals within our own community that could be doing better jobs in all of these positions. It is time to make significant
personnel changes.

3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->I have heard multiple meetings where our professionals are searching for their spreadsheet of
information. Why are we using spreadsheets to track vital information about our district? All of the details asked should have been easy to

gather from an information system. If this is not the case, then we have a serious deficiency in either skills, training, or information systems
overall. I suspect we waste a lot of money on time for individuals to gather details into spreadsheets and have multiple un-related systems that
are costing us a lot of money to maintain and to license. We need to dive into all of "IT" to include all software packages, and not just device
and security management.

reconciliation and closing was not properly done, and when was the last period that was properly reconciled to show accurate bank balances
and financial statements. Lastly who was responsible for ensuring accuracy of financial statements and reports during this time period (all the
way to the C level, as that is how leadership works) and are they still currently active in their role?
Abigail McKenzie--What is going to happen to the pre school programme? Families with low income or children with special needs rely on
this programme and it would be a shame to see it and the wonderful teachers who help our children be let go.
Anna Lucero--<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23cccccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-dataplacement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->I come to you as a parent and community member to express my concerns with the
direction in which our District is heading. We as a community are failing our kids, current and future. The impact this levy failing will have
on our district will be for years to come, but we as a community can bounce back from this. How do we bounce back? We must all come
together and start following our Mission statement at the Moses Lake School District. We are community members, parents, teachers,
administration, Grandparents, EVERYONE. We must all believe it or we have no direction to follow. Our board is designed to hear out the
community and help us by being the voice. Which the board has been trying to do. I feel the board should also be educating themself on the
downfalls of our Administration and taking notes so this doesn't happen for another year. I appreciate all the volunteer hours the board puts in
for this district, I too volunteer in many places across the district. This also goes for our community, get involved, follow along, we as a
community are just as much to blame for all this as anyone else. We elected the board, and we also fail to come forth unless we see a problem
arise. We are the voices for our children, and any future kids that come through this district. I sit and wonder, could these issues have been
prevented, could we have doubled checked where we have become complacent, the answer is most likely yes, but that does not solve the issue
we have at hand. Constant complaining and pointing fingers will not get this community or district out of this. How do we move forward, I
personally do not have the answers, But I do want to point out that our community has complained about the past 3 superintendent's and
pointed out all their issues or downfalls, maybe there is a common denominator that no one is looking at. I challenge the board and any
community members to put their heads together and maybe we can get our district on the right side of wrong for the years to come. I
personally am willing to help in anyway possible to better our community and district, our kids deserve it. Like our mission statement says
MISSION: We are dedicated to ensuring the success and well-being of all. How can we ensure success when we are laying off teachers?

kids worship concert. As any parent would be I was concerned I contacted the district and report the event. I was told that it was within
policy. I will NOT have someone elses religion advertised to my son. This is HIGHLY inappropriate. Policy should not allow any religious
content.
Bill Studebaker--<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23cccccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-dataplacement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Today, I wish to underscore the vital importance of sports in our beloved community
of Moses Lake, Washington, and the potential ramifications should these programs face elimination.
In Moses Lake, sports in our schools are not merely extracurricular activities; they serve as a cornerstone of our efforts to nurture and
empower our youth. These programs offer invaluable opportunities for personal growth, skill development, and community engagement that
extend far beyond the confines of the playing field, pool or track.
One critical aspect to consider is the impact of sports involvement with at-risk youth. In our community, like many others, there are
individuals facing various challenges and vulnerabilities, including the lure of gangs. For these young people, participation in sports can be a
lifelinea constructive outlet for their energy, passion, and potential. By providing a sense of belonging, purpose, and mentorship, sports
programs offer an alternative path away from the dangers of gang involvement.
Eliminating school sports would not only deprive these vulnerable youth of a positive and structured environment but also potentially
exacerbate the risk factors that make them susceptible to gang recruitment. Without the support and guidance provided by coaches,
teammates, and the wider sports community, these individuals may find themselves more susceptible to negative influences and harmful
behaviors.
Moreover, school sports serve as a powerful tool for prevention and intervention in the fight against gang activity. By keeping students
actively engaged and invested in their education, sports programs help create a sense of ownership and pride in their school and community.
Through teamwork, discipline, and mentorship, students learn essential life skills that build resilience and equip them to resist the allure of

gangs and other destructive influences.
Furthermore, the elimination of school sports would have far-reaching consequences beyond the immediate impact on individual students. It
would diminish the sense of camaraderie, school spirit, and community pride that these programs foster. Our Friday night football games,
basketball tournaments, track and swim meets are more than just sporting eventsthey are opportunities for our community to come together,
celebrate our shared values, and support our youth in their endeavors.
As we consider the future of school sports in Moses Lake, let us not underestimate their profound significance in safeguarding the well-being
and resilience of our community, particularly our at-risk youth. Now more than ever, it is essential that we rally together to ensure that every
child has access to the transformative power of sports, regardless of their background or circumstances.
Thank you for your attention to this critical issue, for your ongoing commitment to the welfare of our community, and the future well-being of
our kids.- Bill Studebaker (Parent)

shouldn't cut him because he showed me and told me how i could improve in swimming.

time to look at Vanguard Academy, its effectiveness, staff to student ratio and whether it would benefit the district more if it
was turned into a freshman campus and relieve some of the crowdedness of the high school. Has this evaluation taken place? If
so, what are the findings.
Jason Koziol--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Hello, my name is Jason Koziol. Im born and
raised member in this community. I was a graduate in the class of 1994. Currently, I am a Lieutenant Firefighter with the City of Moses Lake
Fire Department for almost 18 years. Im also parent and a very supportive and loving father of 3 amazing and talented children that have
grown and enjoyed the benefits of school athletics here in Moses Lake. Im writing to request the school board to consider heavily the
ramifications for removing middle and high school athletics and to keep them in our schools. There are so many benefits that students learn
from having and maintaining school athletics in this community. Here are a few to consider like leadership, teamwork, academic
performance, discipline, social skills, time management, mental with emotional health and obviously physical fitness. I feel if you consider
removing any or all school athletics it will create a significant drop in academic performance and success that will hurt our community and
our children. Please think about this if you are considering cutting any athletics from our schools.
Kelsie Wilson--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->I am grateful that my daughter had the
opportunity to be part of the Swim/Dive club for the last two years. This has been a life changing experience for her (in such a positive way). I
think taking this opportunity from all the kids would be so detrimental to their physical and mental health. Thank you for your time.
Nicole Anderson--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->We moved to Moses Lake 11 years ago.
We knew no one and had 3 small boys at the time. One of the first Friday nights we were here we took the boys to a home Varsity football
game. We were in disbelief at the school participation in the football team, cheer and band. The town we came from did not have near the
involvement. The stands here were also so full. We felt that we had made a good choice for our children in terms of moving because Moses
Lake could be a place where they could be part of an amazing community. We immersed our boys in the sports community in Moses Lake
and our entire family has benefited from the relationships that we have formed. We refer to both our football and wrestling teammates and
parents as "family". Sports were our way to meet people and form connections. If the school board makes the decision to not have sports next
year, that may force us to look to other communities to call home since now my older two are in high school and are very involved in both
football and wrestling. I have faith that this community can come together to make sports work this next year. We can get creative and do
more fundraising. Please do not take it away all together.
Brodie Michael Holland--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Hello there. I am currently a
Senior at Moses Lake Highschool this year and would like to inform you about the dangers of affecting sport program funding. If you do not
know, I was a homeschooled student for many years (which also involved the first 2 years of my highschool education). There was no sense
of community in my education, for most of my learning was just on the computer or alone in a room with a book. Fortunately, I was invited
by a sports program which was through the school. It involved summer running and an autumn season involving several meets. This sports
program was none other than cross country. This was the only way I was able to find new friends and a community while in high school.
Even when I joined the Running Start program, the only people that I could have an actual conversation with was the team. That is why I'm
writing this to the school board. Some students have no ability to be involved with other students, especially people who are either not at the

highschool full time or considered "not popular" in the high school. It would be unfair and unjust to affect students who want to seek out a
healthy and engaging community that the highschool contains. Isn't sports suppose to make sure that they contain such a thing? To make this
even more important, some students (including myself) have gone through depression, anxiety, and other forms of pain. The only way we all
were helped while in high school was by the help of good and loyal coaches that took time to know us. I already understand that people in the
high school should already do this, but unfortunately this isn't true. Defunding this program would make a negative impact in not just athletes,
but the entirety and purpose of the highschool student community.
Lillyanne Kappel-Baker--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->This year I joined swim for the
first time and I joined late but all of the girls and the coaches were so kind and supportive, it was some of my favorite timed this year it was
fun and beneficial to my health, at my very first swim meet I swam the 100 yard backstroke all of the girls from my team were on one side
and my coach was on the other everybody was cheering me on and it turns out I got first place and I only got faster from then at the end of the
year the last meet I cut my time by 7 seconds! Which is really good it was one of the most fun sports I have ever done and I would hate for
that to be taken not only from me but from the rest of the girls and the boys team. So please dont cut the sports I look forward to doing swim
next year, hopefully.
Brynn Bond--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Hello, I'm Brynn Bond currently attending
Columbia Middle School as an 8th grader, and next year will be going to Moses Lake High School. I understand the budget cut has put a lot
of stress on teachers, students, admin and more. I think I would definitely keep sports in the district. I started playing sports last year during
spring during my 7th grade year. I was in the middle school swim team run by Jason Hart. He was an amazing coach and showed me the love
one coach would have for a teammate. Jason is one of the main reasons I'm doing other activities and still plan on swimming today. During
8th grade I played volleyball during the fall, basketball during the winter, and joined the swim team for another year in spring. I love
volleyball and plan on taking it to college with me, the game and being on the court. Playing the game has shown me how much I truly love
the game. I'm going to volleyball camps over the summer, the summer practices, and plan on trying to get on the team. I understand the need
to cut a budget from something, but so many people love sports and really care about being on the team. I would love you to take the time to
consider keeping the sports we all love playing. Thank you for your time reading this, have a wonderful day.
Sophia Villalpando--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Dear Board of Directors,I have some
concerns in regards to next years activities at the high school. As a student who intends to apply for ivy league colleges, it is very concerning
to hear that the District may cut AP and accelerated classes to help with the budget issues. This affects not only my high school plans, but my
college and future plans as well. An important thing that colleges look for when reviewing applications is AP classes and scores, looking to
see not only that the student understands the material but also that the student is willing to challenge themselves by taking difficult courses.
Without the opportunity to take these classes, colleges will likely see a student who is not willing to push themselves, rather than a failed
Levy.
Besides academics and coursework, colleges also look for extra-curricular activities. This year many members of the speech and debate team
qualified for State, and one even placed 1st. The team was looking forward to a bright next season led by our amazing coach Mr. Chollman,
but to our disappointment we heard news of the budget cuts likely canceling next year's season. I know for a fact that many of my teammates
have a bright future in this club and are being robbed of the opportunity to pursue them.
Personally, sports are not my strength though I enjoy participating in them. I also have many friends who are relying on scholarship
opportunities from sports to go to college. By taking away sports, you take away their opportunities to pursue a higher education.
Additionally, students such as myself, enjoy coming together to participate in creative activities such as drama and choir. Again, these are on
the list of possible removal for next year. Without these classes students will not have a gathered activity to grow in and learn how to be
members of a team, a life skill that is an important part of society while also getting to express their creative outlet.
I write to you as a concerned student who values her education and looks forward to a bright future. The decisions being made are not as
simple as making a budget to get us through the next few years. These decisions affect and impact my future. I understand running a school
district is expensive and challenging. I too understand that the Levy failed due to our community. But, I also understand that we as students
could not do anything to change either of those things. Yet we are the ones who are being punished and losing opportunities for our futures
based on decisions that are not ours to make.
I ask you to think very long and hard about the choices you are making as they directly impact the future of all Moses Lake students as they
leave the high school and start to be productive members of society.
Mark Ward--<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23cccccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-dataplacement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->I was originally scheduled to speak in person, but I will be at the State Track Meet,
so instead, I'm submitting a written comment.
As an educator with 33 years of experience, I was shocked that following the the first levy failure there was no plan in place moving forward.
Every school district I have been a part of, as either a student, parent, or staff member has published SPECIFIC cuts that would be made if a
levy was not passed. Instead, a blanket statement that "Co-Curriculars are funded by levy dollars..." was used. Why wasn't it spelled out with

specific cuts that the public and staff needed to see PRIOR to a 2nd vote?
Next, why did it take a 2nd failure before the Board, District, and Unions started to look at cuts. You had roughly two months to work through
possible RIFS, Cuts, Transfers...instead you worked at panic mode and lost even more trust from voters and employees.
Third, changing topics slightly, I heard at a previous meeting, discussion on the number of "incoming" Freshmen to Vanguard vs. the number
of Freshmen from last year. What I didn't hear was the retention rate of those freshmen to sophomores. Is the Vanguard student-body staying
put, or are they trying to leave? And if they are leaving, where are they going? Are they moving back to MLHS? Are they being allowed to go
back to MLHS? I've heard from multiple sources that students are being forced into the "online school" if they choose to leave Vanguard. Is
Vanguard a sustainable model or an albatross around the necks of the entire school district?
Fourth, I hope that moving forward the new financial "expert" will look at past expenditures, budgets, and actions taken before moving
forward. Following an attitude of "This is the way it's always been done." is a recipe for further failure. I know I only work in thousands of
dollars as a coach, but in every position I've taken on, my first order of business was to request and look at five to ten years of budgets,
expenditures, and my inventory to make sure I knew where I stood and to see if there were any discrepancies.
Finally, I hope the board is bringing Olympia into the mix? How did we pass ANY of our yearly audits if this much money was double
counted or missing? While there is plenty of blame to go around, our State Auditor cannot be left off the hook. There is a reason we are
required to have yearly audits. Checks and balances are supposed to keep us all safe. This didn't happen at many levels from the top down.
Thank you for taking the time to read this. You all have a very hard job to do. I hope to receive a reply. Respectfully,Mark Ward
Kim Pope--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Dear School Board Members,On behalf of the
Boys & Girls Clubs of the Columbia Basin, thank you for your thoughtfulness as you work through the budget challenges following the recent
levy failure. We are aware of the challenges you face as you consider all alternatives and make difficult decisions.
We want to express my desire to partner with the school district to find solutions to the academic and social/emotional challenges our
community youth face. I began looking at funding options to keep the school-based locations in place as soon as I learned of the levy failure.
As we move forward with those options, it is important to continue to have a very strong partnership with the school district.
In order to assist in filling the needs gap, we would like the school district to assist with academic data collection to meet requirements of
grant funding, such as 21st Century Community Learning Center and the Office of Juvenile Justice Department grants. The school district and
a community-based organization must work in partnership to secure and operate these grants. Access to facilities, at no cost or low cost, could
make the school-based locations sustainable.
In 2023, the Boys & Girls Club served 1152 club members, 552 of whom were at school-based locations, and an average of 117 club
members utilized school district transportation to arrive at the McGraw Family Clubhouse every school day. Currently, the Boys & Girls Club
pays the school district $15,000 per year for transportation to the McGraw Family Clubhouse. Important pieces to the success of after-school
opportunities for our community youth are transportation and access.
We all have the same goals in mind, to provide the best education and a safe environment for our community youth, without barriers. Please
know that the Boys & Girls Club wants to help in any way possible, we are not just an extracurricular program, we are vital to support the
safety and well-being of the students in our community. We feel our programs are essential to the success of the kids we both serve. Feel free
to reach out at any time to discuss the best way for us to work together to achieve our common goals.
In service of youth,Kim Pope
Sydney Stevens--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->I have been part of the Manta Ray swim
team and I love all of the kids and coaches. We use the pool every weekday Monday-Friday. Swim is all year round, because we are losing
money from the Levy. Due to this we may not have the Manta Ray swim team any more. So all I ask is that you think about the pool. I know
many kids that love to swim and kids that need to know how to swim because we live next to a lake. That is why I think that the pool should
be thought about and how many kids need it and have fun swimming on the Manta Ray swim team.
Emma Thompson--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->First off, I appreciate the opportunity for
my words to be shared. My name is Emma Thompson, Im a freshman at Moses Lake High School. I am a 4.0 student who was just inducted
into Honor Society. This year I have lettered in 3 different sports while also being in the band. I share this information with you to help you
understand how academics are extremely important, but the opportunity to do these extracurricular activities have helped me to be more
emotionally and physically healthy. Im extremely saddened as I write this letter. Its disappointing that due to our circumstances you are forced
to choose between many really great things. Students should not suffer because of the failures of adults. The budgeting issues have brought
upon many new changes that affect students, staff and the community of Moses Lake. Throughout the district, numerous strong student
advocates and educators are being lost. However, there is a good possibility that we could be losing extracurricular activities as well. These
include our music programs, clubs, sports, and many other things throughout our schools that allow students to grow outside of the classroom
setting. Theres also a chance of losing many of our AP classes and weve already lost the AVID Program. These programs and clubs give way
for college scholarships and character building opportunities. They also give outlets for student passions and talents as well as encouraging
good grades and attendance. We can already see throughout the district that since these events have begun, morale has decreased. Students are
feeling less of a desire to participate in their programs through the school, as we dont know what will come of them next year. Through this

time of uncertainty, were losing some of our favorite staff members, coaches, classes, and extracurricular activities. I hope you all reflect on
how the shortcomings of the district and community have and will continue to impact the students of the Moses Lake School District. Thank
you again, for your time.

<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->May 22, 2024
Moses Lake School Board
As you look to make your decision regarding whether we will have extracurricular activities or not, we ask that you please consider the
following factors:
Sports, along with many other extracurricular activities are more than just a pass time for kids. These activities have become an escape, a
passion, something that they can set goals to achieve, and once achieved, set higher ones. Activities provide further incentive for these kids to
keep their grades up and strive for a brighter future than they might see without them. To many looking from the outside in, extracurricular
activities are just a hobby, without much learning involved. However, to these kids, it's their life, its their why to live, its the thing that keeps
them out of trouble, and where they actually learn and grow the most. Kids need extracurricular activities to continue building a better future.
Student-Athlete. The name speaks for itself in saying it is more than just a sport. GPA requirements are set by a school standard, and often
raised by individual coaches who take pride in watching the athletes succeed in the classroom. They are pushed by their coaches, to stay
eligible, they are pushed by their teachers, who require action in the classroom before they leave to the field, and finally, they are selfmotivated to push themselves to achieve the all-academic award postseason. Studies show that GPAs drop significantly for kids who do not
participate in extracurricular activities, compared to those who do. The overarching implication of this research is that there appears to be
benefits conferred upon middle and high school students who participate in some form of school athletics (Wretman, 2017). Many athletes
focus on schoolwork in order to play. The struggle shown in grades is much higher in the off-season when they do not have that incentive to
push them to achieve higher grades. We definitely see this personally in high school girls soccer. Taking away these extracurriculars for good
will surely see a significant drop in class participation, as well as overall GPA. And as high school soccer coaches, we sure do not want this
for our athletes.
Mental health crises are increasing everywhere, especially in young teenagers. Physical activity has shown to improve mental health, improve
sleep, decreases cortisol (stress hormone), increases dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin which all increase mood and attention function, and
increases physical health (Mahindru, 2023). Mental health is crucial in teenagers and impacts their future and current state of lives they are in.
Many of these kids have their happiest moments and find their escape through extracurricular activities. These activities allow them to express
themselves and feel included in something, which they might not get elsewhere. When they leave these activities, they may be going back to
an unstable household where they will not get the support and encouragement they need to be successful in school. The field, the team, the
coaches are their safe places to get away from all this and get the support they long for. Without these activities and allowing kids to gather
with their peers and escape the hardships in their lives, we may see them instead turn to drugs or alcohol as their next escape. They will no
longer have a busy schedule, which will allow them to have more time on their hands to get into these bad habits, rather than improving
themselves like they did in extracurricular activities. Without these activities, the mental health of our youth has a high chance of decreasing,
which then will tie back to their grades dropping, and potential poor habits, thus having a large impact on their growth, knowledge, and future.
Through extracurricular activities, kids can connect with other peers of similar interests. They gain communication skills, work ethic, and
build character (Panza, 2019). An important philosophy of coaching that many choose to run their activity by is teaching lifelong lessons
through sport. Shaping the mind and character of our youth happens both in and out of the classroom through these activities. These activities
bring not only kids together, but community, especially in a time where the community is at odds. Youth activity groups give back to the
community in a number of ways and seek their support to continue with the success of their team. Team building is a character trait that these
kids will learn and carry on to their future for years to come. There are several life lessons and tools that these students take away from
extracurricular activities. Without them, these tools may be lost, and the overall well-being and growth of our youth will decline.
The benefits of having extracurricular activities in school vastly outweighs any reason not to. The kids come first, and with the research and
studies explained above, it has been proven that the kids will be more at risk without them. There is much pride, passion, energy, and life that
is brought to these kids through extracurricular activities. For some, its their only escape, for others, its their future, and for all of them, its an
improvement in overall health, well-being, and education.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
On behalf of the Moses Lake High School Girls Soccer team, and with the best interest of all extracurricular activities,

Vickey Melcher-<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->My name is Vickey Melcher and I served on the MLSD board
2017-2021. In 2019 HB 1599 passed, which removed the testing requirements for graduation and replaced it with a set of graduation pathway
options. The SBE set the graduation pathway options beginning with the class of 2020. A couple questions we discussed were which of these
pathways are available to our students and how could pathways reach the needs of a wider range of students? Since one of our goals was to
increase our graduation rate, we felt this was an opportunity for us to add graduation pathways for our students. No longer were we limited to
just traditional pathways - we could now expand to honor and embrace that all kids learn in unique ways. With the visionary leadership of Dr.
Meek, the planning committee decided to build a school that used Project Based Learning school wide. This teaching pedagogy, along with
CBTech and MLHS, provides more students with opportunity for success and graduation. This was developed as a portfolio of learning
options. Everyone should want ALL students individual educational needs met no matter which school the student attends. Competition for
enrollment at these schools is not putting the student first! The bottom line - what is best for the student!!! Unfortunately the vision of
Vanguard and the school it was supposed to be has been lost in politics. I know without a doubt there are skilled teachers and staff facilitating
learning for students at Vanguard in new and creative ways, but the board and administration must stand behind them. Any non-traditional
teaching method takes time to work out the unknown challenges. This is only the second year of Vanguard and already jealous people are
trying hard to sabotage it and get it shut down. Vanguard is not the financial burden that has put the district in the situation it is in. If there was
another school across town, just like the present high school, expenses would be double for the district and NO increase in high school
graduation rates. We had to make the challenging choices to fix the wrongs of previous bond work which would have put the district in an
impossible state match situation for over three decades! Rather than blaming the past, you should be thankful of the work that was done.
Because, doing the same thing over and over, getting the same results, is not sound educational management. I implore you to experience
Vanguard personally. Attend the students passion project presentations. So much enthusiastic learning is taking place. Until you do, and not
just see it as a building with empty space, you are missing out.
<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Gerson Perez Guzman--<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}
br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->To whom it may concern, this letter is being made by a current enrolled Vanguard Academy
sophomore. This message is being sent to the school board hoping it would be read. In no way was this sent to administrators to demand a
change but instead to let them know how we feel about the current situation that has occurred within the school.
Mr. Yonko was assigned Vice Principal for the opening year of Vanguard Academy, currently he was assigned this important role until this
year due to the district having to make other principals leave their own school and having to replace them with other school personnel. Mr.
Yonko is truly one of the most important staff at Vanguard Academy. He has worked tirelessly to shape the school to how it is today. He truly
lego-pieced the way Vanguard Academy is running today. His father figure characteristics have made a family bond within the whole team of
staff and students that is cherished and praised by everyone. Mr Yonko has contributed significantly to Vanguard's growth and success. His
dedication to this school is acknowledged and utterly appreciated by many. A couple days ago the school district broke the news that Mr.
Yonko would be ripped away from the school he tirelessly worked on for so many months. This decision shattered many teachers and
students hearts to pieces because we all knew how much Yonko truly cares about this school and shows up everyday with a smile on his face.
Even if it cant be made possible Mr. Yonko should be kept in our school so he could direct us to keep Vanguard rising to the top day by day.
These decisions should be made with many precautions and SHOULD NOT BE taken lightly. We are losing a big part of Vanguard. A person
with more knowledge and experience within a school should be a top priority and should not be let go so easily. Please do better as a school
district.
Express hope for the future, and, if possible, an interest in solving the problem
Hunter Blackman--I've been a part of sports in Moses lake for as long as I can remember, whether it's been grid kids, club, or for the high
school. It's always been a passion for me and I know so many other kids who absolutely love them too. Sports i feel are an essential part of
growing up and maturing. They teach you important disciplines that you carry with you to workplaces and into relationships. The way you

strengthen relationships with your family is by doing things you enjoy with them. I don't have a lot of close friends, but I do have a very big
family. In football and track we like to break our practices on family to remind us that we aren't only a team, but that we ARE also a family,
sometimes we fight, we're competitive with each other, but ultimately we push each other to become better. Better as an athlete, but more
importantly, better as a person. Most of this growth comes from our coaches, because they really do love us and only want us to succeed.
They really are like our parents. What in trying to say is that sports are a beautiful thing, they give kids something to look forward to and
something to work for. I can say with absolutely no doubt in my mind that if I grew up without sports in my life, I wouldn't be even close to
the person that I am today. That Is why I think that we need sports to stay in Moses lake.

extracurricular activities and sports teams and levels that will exist next year? When will that be shared? Also, when will we
know how many school resource officers will be present at each school next school year? Thank you.

{border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Would it not be a better use of resources to
transition the Vanguard building to be a freshmen campus? There are already ample resources and opportunities available for
students to attend vocation/trade focused classes and alternative routes to obtain da high school diploma or GED through Big
Bend, the high school, and CB Tech. Is the ratio of students to teachers in that building less than that of kindergarten classes?
What is the approximate cost per student in that building for a school year compared to the high school? When looking at the
number of students served or affected by an available program, it would seem that it is time to alter the Vanguard experiment to
make more sense in a financial capacity to provide support to a larger student body with the facility and staff resources already
available. You have available capacity in that building while students and staff at the high school are having to share spaces to
find somewhere to hold a class.

your meeting yesterday that donations have to be local. What is considered local? Moses Lake, Grant County, Washington?

<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Tiffany Quilter--This message was
shared at the Choir concert 5/22/2024. I was given permission from Joanne to post it here as a public comment for the meeting.
Thank you Mr Holloway. We know you will not stand here and sing your own praise so I will. We all love working with you.
In the programs I have been involved in, you and these other parents and the purpose of your program has become one of my
favorite places to serve. It is an absolute honor so thank you. I personally have been around choir for more than my childs years
here but through family friends and family members, and I can not say enough about what choir/and david has done for not
only our children but our community. I know from experiencing these amazing concerts, and events, meetings and group texts
that he pours hrs and days (patty confirms) stressing over EACH number, EACH student and this is not only his profession but
clearly a beautiful talent and passion that he (David Holloway) shares and teaches our young student musicians. For the time
commitment we also want to thank Patty Holloway.
At this time especially I find it fitting to ask you all to stand and applaud Mr Holloway
Its also fitting that we as a choir community and all the other communities that serve us and OUR children that we get involved
the best we can. More than ever our children need us to come together as ADULTS, PARENTS and LEADERS with ideas,
respect and open minds. At this point the hate and finger pointing is of absolute no benefit. We are HERE , whatever HERE
looks like. I would invite all to get involved as you can to keep not only this program going but all the others that benefit your
and collectively OUR children. We MUST move forward.
I asked a few students for quick comments on choir and Mr Holloway and here are a few:Gracie: Second family safe space
grown as a musician.Rianne: Family friends safe place Mr Holloway has pushed me musically that I wouldnt have done myself
Ellie: Holloway has been the best mentor. Always looking out for me and making us laugh and have fun Its like a second family.
Alli: Makes every student in choir feel the most important. He has not just taught choir but life lessons that can be carried
throughout my life and others. He is an ABSOLUTE light to me and makes me want to be more well rounded. Trenton: I love
choir for the opportunities and joy it brings to me. Mr Holloway threatens me to be better. I tried to get the wording softened but
that was the quote Take a look at the white paper with the senior tributes. It will take only a few to realize the reach and impact of
choir, Mr David Holloway and this one program to see the lasting effects we must preserve. JoAnne Hines Vice President of choir
and active parent in Band and many sports and activities including nova, swimming, football, basketball and baseball. Im also an
avid supporter of all teachers!
