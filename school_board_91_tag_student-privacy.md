The special council meeting of the Pullman City Council on February 6, 2024, focused on the approval of the Downtown Pullman Improvement Project, specifically the resolution R-08-24, which accepted the bid from Apollo, Inc. for the project. The project aims to enhance East Main Street, including infrastructure improvements such as water, sewer, and storm mains, as well as road and sidewalk construction. Despite opposition from some residents and business owners, the council ultimately voted in favor of the project, emphasizing the necessity of addressing aging infrastructure to prevent future emergencies. Several council members, including Pat Wright and Megan Guido, expressed support for the project, highlighting the importance of maintaining a viable downtown area and the need for timely upgrades. The council also discussed the financial implications, with a significant portion of the funding sourced from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and the necessity of additional funding for the project's completion. The resolution allows for flexibility in awarding bid additives related to the project, which includes enhancements such as benches and landscaping. The meeting concluded with a call for collaboration and communication to support downtown businesses during construction.
