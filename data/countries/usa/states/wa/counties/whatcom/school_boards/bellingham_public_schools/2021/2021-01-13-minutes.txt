OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
January 13, 2021 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Mason called the meeting to order at 6 p.m. She acknowledged that this meeting,
while attended from various locations, is being held on the ancestral homelands of the
Coast Salish people. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz
Hackler, Jenn Mason (President), Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri
O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
Ms. Mason noted that, because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19, public
participation is limited to written submissions only, and all written comments received
will be shared with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all messages
received.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
Second grade students are scheduled to start in-person learning tomorrow, joining
students in PreK-1, special programs, internet cafes and some high school athletics. Dr.
Baker reviewed the health guidelines districts are using when deciding which students to
bring back to in-person learning. In comparison to some smaller districts, we have been
taking a slow approach. Larger districts, such as Seattle and Spokane, are taking an even
slower approach. Dr. Baker responded to questions from board members.
Vaccines for health care workers are being received across the state, and our school
nurses have appointments for their vaccinations. The current vaccine schedule would
likely mean that educators above 50 years of age will be eligible to receive the vaccine in
Feb., with other employees likely not being vaccinated until sometime in April. There is
strong advocacy for all educators to move up on the schedule so they can be vaccinated
sooner. To accelerate the vaccination schedule, federal recommendations now advise that
states not hold back second vaccine doses. There is a possibility that the district will work
with the county to provide district space for vaccinations to occur.
Grade 3 students could possibly begin in-person learning at the end of January. Because
class sizes are larger in grades 4 and 5, it is more complicated to bring them back than for
those in grades K-3. Elementary principals would like all students to be back in the
classroom four days per week, although space may limit grade 4 and 5 students to two
days per week. The district is looking at alternative locations that may allow the students
to attend four days per week. Middle school students may not return until after all

elementary students are back, although there is a possibility, due to space constraints, that
students in grade 6 would come back prior to grades 4 and 5. The most challenging level
to bring back will be high school due to the number of students. Dr. Baker recently met
with staff members from Bellingham High and Kulshan Middle schools to process what
it will look like to begin bringing middle and high school students back. Dr. Baker
responded to questions from board members.
Dr. Baker reviewed sample modified hybrid schedules (two days per week) for high
school and middle school. Assistant Superintendent of Teaching and Learning Jay Jordan
provided additional information about the schedules and the timing of bringing students
back.
The state legislature is now in session, so it’s likely we will begin to get some indications
about state funding. We have been conservative with spending, and some legislators may
wonder why Bellingham and some other districts have higher fund balances than other
districts. Staffing decisions will begin to be made in the spring. The state superintendent
has shared out some of his recommendations for the education budget.
Following the sharing of photos of students and district staff who are now receiving inperson instruction in our schools, Dr. Baker noted that January is school board
recognition month. He shared a presentation in honor of the school board directors.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The Superintendent highly excels in this area and does an exceptional job of keeping the board
apprised of high-level activities as well as his schedule. Communication through email updates
and other channels is timely, articulate, transparent, and appropriately thorough. During the
pandemic, the Board was kept well-informed through a sizable increase in communications, even
when the context was rapidly changing. The Superintendent’s willingness to engage in in-depth,
sometimes challenging conversations is very much appreciated by the Board, as are community
linkages and study sessions that allow the board the chance to dive deeper into issues and
experiences.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
No areas identified.
4. Comments on the report itself.
The Board appreciates the thoroughness of this report.

5. Possible changes to the policy.
The Board has made a suggestion to potentially change the wording regarding “The
superintendent shall not fail to: a. timely inform the board of circumstances of interest, which
includes items that will reasonably be reported to the press or of a concern to a majority of the
community.” A Board committee will do more research into this possible change.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• Superintendent appointed Krisi Dominguez to work to strengthen relationships with
community partners. BSD rose to the challenge when faced with the pandemic in working
closely with community partners. BSD worked with the City and County and the Lighthouse
Mission to open the doors of Bellingham High School to provide shelter to our homeless
community. The Central Kitchen and many staff stepped up and continue to provide food
boxes to our families in the community. All of these efforts have happened and are continuing
based on staff coming together to come up with solutions to problems. It should be noted that
while last year was a challenging time for a different reason no one could have ever predicted
that this year would be even more difficult. The Board knows that these are challenging times
and appreciates all that staff have done to continue to figure out ways in how to serve our
students and budget is an important part of that.
DB:
• The District has dedicated resources and participated on State-level workgroups to provide
leadership and recommendations to the legislature on funding formulas.
• Strong alignment with GFOA best practices.
• As required by policy the District has received a clean audit most recently and has for the past
consecutive 16 years.

The District’s work to build relationships and partnerships with local partners over the years
was hugely critical during the pandemic. Through this excellent work, many services and
programs were able to be developed, maintained, and/or adapted for our students in the 20192020 school year. Much appreciation for the work of the Superintendent, Executive Team,
and staff who were able to serve our students and community members in this way.
-Despite uncertainty in projections due to changing formulas/funding levels, a coherent,
carefully developed budget was developed that helped to offer confidence, even during a time
with many unknowns.
The report shows a tremendous increase in grants worked on this year (63 compared to 37)—
the effort it takes to seek out new funding sources, explore viability, and prepare a proposal
shows a commitment to seeking new funding and innovation. The year also highlights the
importance of community partnerships—appreciate that partnerships not only help meet
student needs, but also show the role of the district as a broader public structure.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Excellent. Appreciative of the many hours of work that goes into these reports especially
when there are so many other things that staff is continuing to work on during this time.
Thank you for the timelines and highlights provided in the report.
DB:
• Thank you for the italicized highlights.
JM:
• None
KR:
• The budget report is referred to by several different names in the report and on the website
(budget report, budget book, 2020 Budget Book Final by Communications, Final Budget
Fiscal Year 2020-21) being consistent with the name and moving away from jargon like
“budget book” would be helpful for accessibility.

KB:
• Elimination of toxic chemicals. Replacement of 42 buses. Carpentry staff altering spaces at
our schools due to COVID protocols. Replacing fluorescent lights with LED at several of our
schools. Food to Flowers Program impressive in being able to divert food from our landfill.
Solar ready roofs to be able to accommodate solar panels. Continued appreciation for our
staff. This has been a challenging time and this department has been tasked with doing things
that they have not had to do in the past. this report highlights the many things that our
community has done to improve our schools
DB:
• Busses received ‘excellence’ ratings in the bi-annual Washington State Patrol inspections and
‘100% Transportation Efficiency Ratings’ from the Office of Superintendent of Public
Instruction.
• Nice to see an obvious emphasis on energy savings, such as retrofitting light and sustainable
practices, PSE recognition, lower energy costs, sustainable food practices etc.
• An impressive list of completed facilities and projects.
JM:
• The Food Share Shelves Program is a great idea and sounds like a win-win, in terms of
eliminating food waste and helping provide extra food for kids.
• Great to see all of the efforts made to conserve energy across sites, including sizable savings
through the PSE grant and food waste programs.

KR:
•

Impressive outcomes in a wild year—appreciate the flexible staff focused on preventative
maintenance while also finding innovative ways to adapt spaces for improved safety upon
reopening. Especially impressive in the face of staffing reductions and general mayhem of the
Covid-19 pandemic.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
JM:
• Not really for improvement, but will be interested to see outcomes of changes made to lower
the EUI at Options and Sehome.
4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• The Board appreciates all of the data required.
DB:
• Thank you for the bold highlights.
JM:
• Very thorough, particularly appreciate the outline depth of information about sustainability
efforts, as we know this is an important shared District and community value.
KR:
• Overall, very clear and comprehensive report, and I appreciate the bolded areas highlighting
key points. Possible areas for improvement: given that this report covers topics outside the
purview of the average member of the public (and at least one current board member), it
would be helpful to keep the language about data consistent with the included data set
(example: data set refers to employee injuries, but in the report they’re referred to as staff
accidents). Additionally, as there are well-documented societal systemic bias issues in the
medical field, it may be useful to include data or other evidence for assertions about changes
to L&I just to avoid the potential appearance of bias in district assessment.
5. Possible changes to the policy.
