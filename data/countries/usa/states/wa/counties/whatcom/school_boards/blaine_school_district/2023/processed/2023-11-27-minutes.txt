  Regular Board Meeting

  Minutes
  1. Regular Board Meeting
A. Call to Order
President Thomas called the meeting to order, in the district's boardroom, at 7:00 p.m.

All directors were in attendance.
     Kimberly Akre, Dougal Thomas, Erika Creydt, Charles E Gibson, Don Leu
  B. Pledge of Allegiance
President Thomas led in the Pledge of Allegiance.
  C. Board Comments on the Agenda
Director Creydt moved to table the board's action to extend the superintendent's contract, stating that the new board would be in office during the time of that extension. There was no second to the motion. President Thomas declared that the motion died on the floor for lack of a second. Director Creydt asked why the board was in a hurry to take this action. President Thomas reminded Director Credyt that this action was part of the board's routine annual procedure of evaluating the superintendent's performance. This procedure included extensive discussion which took place at the November 16 special meeting, while in attendance at the annual WSSDA Conference, which Director Creydt missed for the second year in a row. There was discussion clarifying that the current board is approving their own evaluation of the superintendent and extension of the contract's end date. However, the other terms of the contract will be negotiated by the board president and vice president who will be elected at the December meeting, and the new board taking office at that meeting will consider approval of those contract terms. President Thomas clarified that this procedure aligns with the practice of school boards across the state. Director Leu suggested that the new board can set their own evaluation criteria for the superintendent which would inform this process when it is repeated next year. He added that the current board is appropriately acting on their evaluation of how the superintendent has performed in the past year based upon the criteria that the current board set for him.
    2. Good News
A. Thank You Kimberly Akre, Dougal Thomas, and Charles Gibson!
Outgoing Directors Kimberly Akre, Dougal Thomas, and Charles Gibson were recognized for their dedication and commitment while serving on the school board. Kimberly Akre has served since February 2023, Dougal Thomas since December 2019, and Charles Gibson since September 2006. Dr. Granger shared personal comments about each of these directors, and they were each presented with a recognition plaque.
  B. High School Student Report
Blaine High School students Sabrina Boczek and Jonathan Morris attended the meeting to share information about the high school's Technology Students Association whose primary purpose is to introduce students to STEM careers. Their annual events were reviewed, including Cancer Awareness Week during which they raise funds for the American Cancer Society. Other fundraising done throughout the year supports TSA students' participation in state competition, as well as the national competition when qualified. Director Gibson asked if there are any famous BHS TSA alumni, Director Creydt asked if recruiters attend the state and national competitions, President Thomas asked if the group's advisor, Mike Dahl, was part of TSA in school, and discussion followed each question. Director Akre commented on fundraising she has observed at sporting events, and Director Leu congratulated the group for their impressive reputation in the community and for all that they do.

Sabrina and Jonathan then distributed handouts of information on the topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI). They shared an additional report on their experience with the use of AI, as well as ethical, educational, and governance considerations. Director Creydt asked if colleges are polarizing in terms of allowing AI, and Sabrina shared comments about how the use of AI is evolving in colleges. At the end of their report, Sabrina revealed that the handout was created with an AI tool called Google Bard. Director Akre expressed appreciation for this information. President Thomas asked about the prompts used to create the report. Director Gibson asked how long it took for the tool to generate the report. Director Leu shared comments about his professor colleagues who are having a hard time managing the use of AI in their college classrooms. He acknowledged that this will be one of the more important challenges that the district will have to face in coming years, and we will all need to work together to address it. Sabrina thanked the board for bringing this topic up for discussion.
  3. Public Comment
A. Public Comment
The following individuals addressed the board regarding topics of concern:
Natalie Chavez complimented the high school students on their AI presentation. Their mention of AI bias reminded her of the bias shown by manufacturers of the COVID vaccine. Ms. Chavez proceeded to share multiple examples of people whose deaths could be tied to having received the COVID vaccine, including her daughter's professor who died over the recent holiday weekend.
Kerry Nanninga expressed a desire for broader staff and community involvement in the superintendent's evaluation which she believes would be an equitable method similar to how teachers are evaluated in the PLC environment.
  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Monthly Reports
Each school administrator reviewed their monthly report to the board. They each also expressed appreciation to the outgoing board members.
Blaine Primary School: Director Leu asked about the school's library services, and Principal Michelle McKeown explained the ways that students are given access to books even though library services have been suspended due to staffing reductions.
Blaine Elementary School: Director Creydt asked what barriers have been identified regarding student attendance, and Principal Jordan Radke described how increased and improved communication with families has had a positive impact. Director Leu congratulated the school on its improved attendance rates, and he asked for clarification regarding how 90% attendance equates to days missed. He also asked about the most common reasons that students miss school. Mr. Radke indicated that family vacations, illness, and home or financial constraints are most common.
Blaine Middle School: Principal Darren Benson additionally provided detail regarding how attendance expectations have evolved over the past several years. Director Akre asked for clarification about how teachers "pace out" their lessons, and discussion followed.
Blaine High School: Director Leu commended the school's math team and discussion followed. Principal Scott Ellis shared special appreciation for Director Gibson's long-time interest in AVID.
  B. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reviewed enrollment for the month of November which declined again by 4 FTE. The grand total for K-12 enrollment is within one FTE of the budgeted amount, although not all grade levels are at par. The Transition to Kindergarten program is very popular and is now distinctly recognized by the state as separate from basic education. When planning the next budget year, the district will need to consider the impact of smaller kindergarten sizes coming in and larger graduating classes exiting out.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of October which included strong tax collection revenue. President Thomas asked about the timing of that revenue, and Ms. Porter reviewed the property tax due dates which fall at the end of April and October. Director Creydt asked how much more will be collected. Ms. Porter indicated that 8% of the district's capital levy is yet to be collected, however that collection can continue to trickle in over the coming years. Ms. Porter also shared that this level was 15% in 2010. Year-to-year comparisons were reviewed, and it was noted that expenditures are tracking similar to past years. Factors causing lower revenue include lower enrollment and reduced LAP funding.

Ms. Porter explained that, in addition to the monthly Financial Report, directors will be provided with Budget Status Reports when they are available. The directors were encouraged to reach out to Ms. Porter outside of the meeting to discuss any questions.
  D. WSSDA Conference Review
The following individuals shared a summary of information learned at the WSSDA Annual Conference:
Dr. Granger thanked those directors who were able to attend. He appreciated the addition of an advocacy pre-conference. The WSSDA conference has been sold out for the past two years, and Dr. Granger explained the organization's plan to expand future conference capacity. Dr. Granger expressed his belief that attendance at the annual conference is a quality experience for both superintendents and board members.
Director Gibson summarized the information provided at the law conference which included race-based hiring, law suits regarding social media addiction, and districts currently in binding conditions. He expressed appreciation for Amber Porter's work in responsibly managing the district's finances to avoid the crisis of binding conditions. As his final term draws to a close, Director Gibson called for caution when inflammatory comments are made about the district as happened last spring. He encouraged trust in the the audited figures presented by the district's business office. Director Gibson shared additional comments about a conference session that addressed the importance of practicing the Golden Rule and recognizing each others' dignity when having difficult conversations. Director Gibson also shared his rationale for being part of this year's annual conference in support of his involvement in launching a local education foundation to benefit students in the Blaine School District community.
Director Leu shared information provided in the Strategic Advocacy Academy. A new state capital gains tax was passed this past year, with funds earmarked for education. Director Leu encouraged others to pay attention to how this funding ends up being divided, and he cautioned that there will be competing interests trying to get their hands on that money. OSPI has also been advocating for an increase in the prototypical school funding model for para-ed wages, as well as for an increase to state funding for new school construction.
Director Akre echoed the comments made by Directors Gibson and Leu, and added her appreciation for being able to participate in this valuable learning experience.
  E. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
There was a good turnout of participation in family conferences at the beginning of November.
The district's first levy/bond information session for the community will take place at the Blaine Senior Center on November 28 at 6:00 p.m.
Dr. Granger described his efforts to investigate a virtual option for secondary instruction. For the purpose of learning about their preferences, he has reached out to and met with several families who withdrew from Blaine to attend an online school.
PLC Leads are being discussed for the future.
The calendar committee will be reviewing three options for the 2024-2025 school year. One option is a balanced calendar and the other two are traditional calendars. Dr. Granger reminded the board that the school year calendar is chosen by a vote of the teacher's union members and not by the district administration. He hopes to bring the teachers' recommendation to the board for approval at the January meeting.
The Supper with the Superintendent on November 20 was again well attended and there were good discussions with families.
Dr. Granger explained that guidance will be coming soon from OSPI on the topic of using Artificial Intelligence in schools. Because AI is evolving so quickly, it is not feasible to implement a formal policy at this time. This topic is also being reviewed in Dr. Granger's advisory committees with staff, parents, and students. It will also be addressed with staff on the May 9 teacher work day. He further commented that OSPI intends to lead the country in developing guidelines for the use of AI in schools, emphasizing the importance of human interaction with the new technology.
