A RESOLUTION FOR THE

WHEREAS, the Secretary to the Board is required to sign all warrants

A RESOLUTION REQUESTING A WAIVER
OF THE MINIMUM 180-DAY SCHOOL YEAR FOR GRADES K-12 (WAC 180-18-040)
WHEREAS, the state legislature requires that the school year consist of 180 school days,
and the Eastmont School District No. 206 is requesting a waiver of the minimum 180 day school
year for the 2025-26 school years for grades K-12; and
WHEREAS, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) is authorized to approve
a waiver of this requirement, conditional upon the district’s providing adequate evidence that it is
improving student learning through increased parental involvement and parent teacher communication
by attending parent teacher conferences; and
WHEREAS, the Eastmont School District has tracked attendance for parent teacher conferences
and when half day conferences were held, attendance dropped throughout the District. All parties stated
lack of time as being the major detractor. Our educators shared the exhausting effect of preparing and
conducting both student instruction and parent conferences on the same day. Using all-day conferences
has resulted in increased satisfaction from both parents and educators; and
WHEREAS, the Eastmont School District will continue to meet the minimum instructional hour
offerings in grades kindergarten through twelve per RCW 28A.150.220(2)(a) under the waiver plan.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT, the Board of Directors of the Eastmont School
District No. 206 approves the request for a waiver from the OSPI to move from 180 school days to 177
school days for the 2025-26 school year.

K-2 students are served through in-class
differentiation. The HiCap Coordinator/Teacher
served all 3rd-6th grade students. Schools could
choose the service model to best suit their
building/grade. 1) Serve students through a
pull-out program at individual schools for 30-60
minutes every week during Tier 3 intervention
time. Additional students, needing extension
services, are added to the roster. 2) Some
classes opted for a push-in model with
extension academies/walk-to-read/success time.
276 students served in the Elementary Schools
23-24.
As of October 2024, HiCap is serving 317
students.

In 2nd grade, students are given the universal CogAT
screener for HiCap. For the first time, all 5th-grade students
were screened at building data meetings for referral for full
CogAT testing to ensure equitable identification. (This aligns
with the new legislation that makes this mandatory in the
2023-24 school year.)
Used multiple language options for the CogAT screener and
CogAT 7 test to ensure that language was not a barrier to
qualification.
HiCap Coordinator worked with ML teachers to identify
students who demonstrated major growth in WIDA scores in
at least two domains. Placed students on a watch-list to
consider nomination.
