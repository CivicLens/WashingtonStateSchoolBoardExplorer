Action

Recommended Action :

Motion to approve.

Public Content
MIDAS works with non-profit organizations (specifically in this case with InvestEd, a private donor for student access to
financial assistance to address barriers to education).
1. MIDAS Education is a FERPA compliant organization and will be responsible for protecting the data.
2. No personal identifying information will be sent to InvestED. There will be a built in firewall, so we have no
access to that information. What this agreement will allow InvestED to do is look at the broad data of the
students we impact in your district. This will allow us to secure more money for schools, as we have better data
backing up our program.
3. MIDAS at some point will be a statewide education data company, but because of COVID those plans have
been put on hold
Points one (1) to three (3) come from David Hartness with InvestEd.
