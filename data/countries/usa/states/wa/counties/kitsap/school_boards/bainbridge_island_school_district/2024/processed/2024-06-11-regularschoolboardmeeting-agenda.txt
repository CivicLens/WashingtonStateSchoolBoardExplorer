RE: Instructional Materials Committee recommendation for approval of Amplify curriculum for 6th grade Language Arts
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
At the May 2nd quarterly meeting, the BISD Instructional Materials Committee voted unanimously to support the approval of
Amplify curriculum for use in 6th grade Language Arts classes.
The attached presentation provides background information about the Language Arts curriculum review and adoption process
and provides an overview of the Amplify curriculum. This presentation was prepared by the Sakai 6th grade Language Arts
teaching team, and presented at the May 2nd IMC meeting. IMC members had a chance to preview the curriculum during the
2022-2023 school year during the initial single-unit pilot, and again during this school year as part of a full pilot (three units).
Teachers were available to answer questions about the curriculum at the March 21st IMC meeting and the May 2nd IMC
meeting, IMC members were provided with online access to the materials and hard copies of the texts used for each unit.
Recommended action:
School board approval for the adoption of Amplify as core curriculum for 6th grade Language Arts instruction in the Bainbridge
Island School District.

RE: Instructional Materials Committee recommendation for approval of The Book Thief
____________________________________________________________________
At the March 21st quarterly meeting, the BISD Instructional Materials Committee voted unanimously to support the approval of
The Book Thief for use in 8th grade Language Arts classrooms.

The 8th grade Language Arts teachers at Woodward Middle School piloted the text during the 2023-2024 school year. The IMC
members also read The Book Thief during the 2023-2024 school year, and spent time during the March 21st IMC meeting
discussing the text, asking questions about the context for the use of the text in the broader curriculum, and sharing thoughts
and reflections for future consideration. The IMC voted unanimously to recommend the BISD School Board approve The Book
Thief for adoption as a core instructional material in 8th grade. As follow up to the questions and reflections shared by the IMC, I
arranged for a full release day for 8th grade Language Arts teachers and 10th grade English teachers to facilitate the articulation
of curriculum specific to The Holocaust. Additionally, Paul Regelbrugge from the Holocaust Center of Seattle came to work with
teachers for the day, and provide professional learning and resources to complement the lessons and units previously developed
and taught by our teachers.
Recommended action:
School board approval for the adoption of The Book Thief as core curriculum for 8th grade Language Arts instruction in the
Bainbridge Island School District.

To: Bainbridge Island School District Board of Directors & Superintendent Amii Thompson
From: Maria Kuffel, Director of Student Services
Re: Policy 2163 Multi-Tiered Systems of Support/Response to Intervention Second Reading
_____________________________________________________________________
I am bringing forward the second reading of a new policy, policy 2163: Multi-Tiered Systems of Support/Response to
Intervention. While the district has been building our Multi-Tiered Systems of Support for the last few years, we have not yet
adopted a policy or procedure that describes the Response to Intervention Process. Policy 2163 describes the process by which
the district will identify students challenges early and intervene when necessary by implementing scientific, research-based
interventions in the general education setting, measuring students response to intervention, and using data about response to
intervention in order to inform instruction and intervention. A committee of educators will work on creating the procedure for this
policy so that there are clear and explicit instructions for how to implement Response to Intervention practices with the intent to
identify Specific Learning Disabilities in the area of Reading through the RTI process in the 2024-2025 school year. Identification
of SLD in Reading will be the first step toward identifying all Specific Learning Disabilities through an RTI process by 2028.
Procedure 2162 will also be modified to reflect the change in procedure of identifying Specific Learning Disability in Reading
through the RTI process for school year 2024-2025.
I request the approval of Policy 2163 Multi-Tiered Systems of Support/Response to Intervention second reading.
