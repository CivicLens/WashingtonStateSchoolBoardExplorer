## 2016-10-20 - BELLINGHAM_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS (Minutes)

The Bellingham School District Board of Directors held a regular meeting on October 20, 2016.  The Superintendent's report focused on the implementation of a Social/Emotional Learning program and provided updates on a 1:1 technology initiative. During discussions about Social/Emotional Learning, directors asked questions regarding its connection to The Bellingham Promise, strategies for encouraging empathy and resilience in students, addressing student anxiety, and the overlap with parent engagement. Concerns about ethical and responsible use of technology by students were raised during the discussion on the 1:1 technology program.  The board approved several consent agenda items, including minutes from a previous meeting, investments, and various contracts and agreements. The board also discussed school visits and linkages, briefly touching upon political endorsement protocol.

Policy changes mentioned include the rollout of a 1:1 technology initiative with plans for professional development for staff at pilot schools (Squalicum, Options, and Kulshan) in the 2016-2017 academic year. Students at these pilot schools would receive devices in the 2017-2018 school year. The process would be repeated annually with additional schools added.  The board discussed ethical and responsible use of technology by students as part of this initiative.  No specific policy changes were explicitly mentioned regarding Social/Emotional Learning beyond its implementation and ongoing development.
