----- Written Comment(s) -----

1. Esther Pigg:*Hello School Board, I would like to address section 3000- Students in the policy manual Code 3130 and Code
3131P. From experience with my own kids and from attending the district meetings I have learned that it is common/normal in this
district to force students to transfer to another school if their residential school is at capacity. We were told a few days before
school started, after we registered and bought school supplies, that the 5th grade was too full and that one of my 3 kids was not
allowed to attend our assigned school (the other 2 were welcome to attend our residential school). This went against part A and B
of Code 3130. Code 3131P allows students to apply to transfer to another school but only if there were at least 2 open seats in each
classroom of that grade level. But, once transferred they can stay there without reapplying until their tenure is done in that school.
It does not say that current transfer students can be denied if a residential student needs their spot. I would like to see an
amendment to Code 3131P that requires elementary transfer students to have to reapply each year and let the parents know that the
transfer can even be revoked up until the new school year. (Elementary only because of the smaller class sizes). I am for school
choice and allowing students to transfer but they shouldn't take priority over residential students and if a school is at capacity then
the transfer students should be first to be required to move. Not a residential student Thank you
