  3. Reports
A. School Administrator Reports
Brief reports were provided by administrators from the following schools:
Blaine Primary School: Mr. Jordan Radke shared the school's enthusiasm about welcoming 20 students back into the building for Life Skills and preschool programming. He shared information about a parent survey done recently which resulted in positive feedback for virtual learning, as well as suggestions for improvement resulting in adjustments. The school's goal-oriented work includes building routines to support social emotional and academic development as well as gathering assessment data.
  Blaine Elementary School: The PTO assisted with purchasing t-shirts for P-5 staff members which are worn with pride on Tuesdays. These are a great way to demonstrate unity. Dr. Craig Baldwin described the new year assembly which took place virtually during classroom time last week and included a video which is accessible from the school's website. This annual event introduces students to school staff as well as character attributes and the 4 B’s of B.E.S. He shared enthusiasm at seeing a limited number of students in the building for Life Skills programming, and he commented on staff members' excitement about bringing students back.

Director McKinney asked about the current response of K-5 teachers to the return of students in the building and discussion continued. Both Mr. Radke and Dr. Baldwin reported a positive response from teachers. The schools are making every effort to balance safety with serving children.
  Blaine Middle School: Training on the new Fountas & Pinnell curriculum was provided on two Fridays in September for 6th grade teachers. CEL Math training and other professional development was also provided this month. Mr. Darren Benson described the use of a lesson launch in kicking off new topics for instruction. School goals in September focused on establishing predictable routines and building classroom culture. There has been a lot of evident growth since March in the online instruction provided to students, and parents who call the school are providing positive feedback and encouragement.
  Blaine High School: Mr. Scott Ellis explained the midterm review process for the high school's 6-year accreditation through AESD. College in the High School registration is beginning this week and Mr. Ellis thanked the board for their support in lowing the cost to $15 per class. A virtual open house will be held for families on September 30. Senior parents are encouraged to participate in a virtual FAFSA overview which takes place on October 8, followed by an online filing event on October 13. Graduation for the Class of 2021 has been scheduled for June 11 at 6:00 p.m.
B. Teaching & Learning Report: 2020-2021 Highly Capable Program Plan
Highly Capable Program (HCP) Coordinator Dawn Cottnair presented the board with the district's HCP plan for the 2020-21 program year. She described the program's vision and efforts to ensure teachers have the necessary resources to deliver a quality program in a virtual environment. Training for both teachers and parents will be provided this year. Ms. Cottnair reviewed the identification process which took place in the spring with notification to families in June. Focus areas for 2020-21 will include improvement of both rigor and communication. Plans at the K-5 level were reviewed and will include weekly skill building work for students as well as Flexible Math Concepts training for staff. At the 6-12 level, students will be supported in more individualized ways with the use of Cluster Grouping and specialized learning plans.

Director McKinney asked about highly capable students at the middle school level having access to accelerated class selections in order to advance ahead of their grade level. Ms. Cottnair explained that this is only offered in math at this time but expansion of offerings could be considered.

Pursuant to the requirement for HCP funding, the board took action later in the meeting to approve the plan.
  C. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment for the month of September which was lower than the budgeted FTE. She described OSPI's extension of September's count day and explained that the report attached to the meeting agenda was still preliminary. Ms. Porter has never seen enrollment drop so far below the budgeted FTE. The significant reduction is largely a result of families' reluctance to participate in the remote learning model. Therefore, once students are able to return to school, she expects the district's enrollment will return to a strong position. Once the decision was made to start school remotely, the district took initiative, in those two weeks prior to school, to restrict spending in anticipation of the significant financial impact of reduced enrollment. Running Start and Open Doors enrollment will not be available until October.
  D. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses for the month of August. The cash flow report is accurate, but additional 2019-20 payments will be counted in August which will cause those expenditure totals to increase before the year is fully closed out. A comparison to last year is difficult because many programs are not operating at all or are operating differently this year due to the current pandemic situation. The district is making efforts to track expenditures similarly as much as possible. Ms. Porter explained various ways that revenue will be negatively impacted by decreased enrollment as well as bus ridership and food service. She also explained how decreased revenue could impact special programs serving students (i.e. ELL, Sped, etc.).
  E. Legislative Update
A Legislative Update was provided by Director Laura McKinney. She described WSSDA's annual General Assembly which was held virtually on Friday, September 25th. Director McKinney learned a lot through the process, and she reviewed main points and common themes with the other directors. Director McKinney will draft a summary of Blaine School District's top 15 position proposals which she will provide to Dr. Granger and President Gibson for review prior to submitting to WSSDA's legislative committee.
  F. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update on current district activities.
OSPI Budget Requests have been submitted to the governor, and Dr. Granger reviewed items that were included.
The district is continuing to work with community partners on a plan for outdoor student activities on Fridays to be funded by the 21st Century grant.
Dr. Granger described the conflicting information that has been released regarding athletics. Although WIAA has indicated that practice could start this week, this goes against guidance from the Department of Health. The district has decided to wait for further guidance before proceeding with athletic practices.
The first week with Life Skills and preschool students on campus has gone well. Kindergartners will return to a hybrid model in the next phase, hopefully starting on October 12. Dr. Granger described plans for successive phases and cautioned that progress is dependent upon community case loads which are currently trending up again. The district is working on alternatives to accommodate staff members in high risk categories. There have been some staff members in close contact with positive cases (outside of school) and they have had to quarantine for the 14-day period. Those staffing variables cannot be predicted in planning for the return of students.
The district's financial situation is being continually monitored in order to identify the possible need for additional staffing reductions. In addition to last month's reduction of SEIU staffing, per diem days have now been reduced for all administrators and non-represented employees. Dr. Granger described the projected impact that reduced enrollment will have on levy revenue. He also addressed LAP funding which is based upon a school's percentage of students in the Free and Reduced Lunch program. F&RL applications are well below average this year which is likely because all students are being provided with free meals.
As allowed by Policy 6225, the use of electronic signatures will be expanded to include Special Education parent agreements. The US Department of Education has issued a letter acknowledging that electronic signatures would be acceptable for this purpose.
Last spring, 5th grade students were granted email accounts in order to prepare for their use in 6th grade. At the request of 5th grade teachers, this will become a regular practice each spring in order to help students experience a smooth transition from elementary to middle school. They have requested an earlier date this year, and 5th grade emails will be activated at the end of the first quarter.
The governor's current prohibition on in-person meetings is set to expire, but may be extended. An announcement is expected by the end of this week.

There was discussion regarding the possibility of all K-12 students being in the full hybrid model by the beginning of second semester at the end of January. Dr. Granger reiterated the importance of community case loads remaining low enough for this to happen. Health and safety protocols have been working well for buildings. Director McKinney also pointed out that the number of hospitalizations in Whatcom County has remained low.

Director McKinney asked for further explanation regarding increased funding for inclusionary practices and discussion followed regarding special education practices.

Options for outdoor activities on Fridays were also discussed in more detail.
