Public Content
The board values public input. The responsibility of the board is to listen and reflect on public comments
actively. The board may only discuss and act upon items included in the written agenda. For that reason,
board members cannot respond to any comments or questions during public comment but can ask the
Superintendent to follow up on issues raised during public testimony.
Guidelines for public input emphasize the respect and consideration of others. Boisterous conduct will not
be permitted at any meeting of the Board of Directors, nor will any harassing or threatening remarks be
tolerated. Complaints about individual employees should be directed to the superintendent's office as a

personnel matter. The board requests that anyone who has submitted written public comments refrain
from reading them during this portion of our meeting to allow other community members to share their
comments.
Each person providing public comment will have a total of 3 minutes. Once called upon, please step up to
the podium, face the board, and state your name for the record. The bell will ring at 3 minutes to remind
you that your time is up.
