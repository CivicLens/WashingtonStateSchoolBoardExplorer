Educational Specifications

Meeting :

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached resolution 25-18 which, as
superintendent, I have reviewed and approved.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
As part of the requirements for obtaining state construction funding assistance associated with the
replacement of Alderwood Elementary School, the school board must approve the Educational
Specifications associated with the new school.
During the spring of 2018 the 32 member Alderwood Elementary School Educational Specifications
/Design Advisory Committee comprised of staff members, parents, community members, and consultants
met to develop the educational specifications for our new Alderwood Elementary School. Micah Smith
and Ron Cowan led this effort with support from Kelli Smith and Zach Ham from Dykeman Architects.

The Educational Specifications (Ed. Specs.) are a compilation of written narratives intended to describe
the activities and physical/spatial requirements of the new school. Their purpose is to provide a written
document that communicates to the architects the goals and requirements of the new school. Further, the
Ed. Specs. define the functions, relationships, values, and goals that the design must respond to.
The process involves identifying and describing specific physical needs and other considerations for the
various programs which will take place in the school. These considerations include the number and type
of occupants, size, lighting, plumbing, HVAC, power, data/voice, finishes (floors, walls, ceiling), and
specialties such as casework, whiteboards, projection screens, the use of technology, and proximity
/adjacency requirements.
Attached for board approval is Resolution 25-18 which certifies the school boards approval of the
Alderwood Elementary School Educational Specifications.
A copy of the entire document is also attached.

2.7 Resolution 30-18, Certifying the District's Levy
Collections for 2019 Calendar Year

Meeting :

Nov 7, 2018 - Regular Board Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached resolution 30-18 which, as
superintendent, I have reviewed and approved.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
Resolution 30-18 certifies the districts levy collections for calendar year 2019 to Whatcom County. Recent changes in the law presented us
with a timing and calculation challenge for determining our local levy.The attached resolution reflects the amount approved bylocal voters
with the understandingthat the amount collectedwill ultimately be lower.
At the February 9, 2016 election, the voters of Bellingham Public Schools passed a General Fund Educational Support and Operations
Excess Levy in the amount of $34,900,000 for collection in calendar year 2019. Recent changes in the laws regarding imposition of local tax
levies and use of local revenues have limited the amount of money that may be collected by school districts in the form of local levies for
general operational purposes. For Bellingham Public Schools, the calculation of allowable local levy is based on the assessed value of
property in the district. Under law, the board of directors is required to certify the levy amount to the assessor by November 30.
Because the assessed value will not be known until the county assessor certifies the value in early 2019, we are unable to accurately
calculate the allowable local levy by November 30, 2018. As a result of this challenge, the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction
has advised that affected districts may certify with their county an amount in excess of their (calculation)... if they wish to ensure maximum
collections when final assessed valuations come in. The County Assessor will adjust the levy request to the allowable amount for collection
in 2019 once the assessed value is certified. Therefore, in the attached resolution the board certifies a General Fund Educational Support
and Operations Excess Levy that reflects the approval and request of our voters for $34,900,000.
