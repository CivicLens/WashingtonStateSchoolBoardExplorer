A. Public Comment
The following individuals addressed the board regarding topics of concern:
R. Wilson expressed concern that Blaine School District would continue to require students to wear masks after the statewide mandate is lifted. She described the impact of wearing a mask that she has observed in her own child, and she begged the district to remove the mask requirement.
L. Kloes described what she has witnessed over the past two years of the pandemic and the impact on students. She expressed concern that scientific truths about mask wearing and testing are being ignored. She criticized the school district for following the health authority's guidelines in order to maintain funding, and described it as exploitation of children for profit. She asked that the district lift the mask requirement.
Natalie Chavez voiced her dismay that students have been required to wear a medical device for many hours every day. She stated that the board failed to protect students in favor of funding.
  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Reports
Written reports from each school administrator were attached to the meeting agenda for board review and supplemented the verbal reports provided during the work session prior to this meeting.
  B. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment for the month of February. Overall enrollment remains below budgeted enrollment and below the level of enrollment in the spring of 2021. Ms. Porter explained factors that impact enrollment, including transfers at the second semester, as well as the Primary School's new Bright K program.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of January. Director Creydt asked for clarification about claiming ESSER funds and discussion followed. Ms. Porter explained that revenue appears, on the report, to be behind at this point in the year because ESSER funds are not yet received. She expects the district to be on solid financial footing at the start of next year. Ms. Porter invited anyone interested to make an appointment to come speak with her for a more detailed discussion about the district's finances.

  E. 1000 Series Policy Manual Update: First Reading
At the policy work session on February 9, the board directed Dr. Granger to provide the following information and adjustments which Dr. Granger addressed in this meeting.
After consulting with the director of WSSDA, it was confirmed that language was stricken from Policy 1220 in order to prevent secret discussions and straw polling. There is, however, nothing prohibiting board members from talking to each other.
Hyperlinks to Policy 4220 were added where the "Citizen Complaint policy" is referenced in Procedure 1620P. Director Creydt said she still thinks a form would be good to have. President Thomas respectfully disagreed and expressed concerns about the impersonal use of a form for addressing complaints. Discussion continued.
The language of Procedure 1820P has been updated where it references the board's five major functions to align with Policy 1005.

The board approved "First Reading" of these updates to the 1000 series of the Blaine School District's Policy Manual.

President Thomas said that both candidates were exceptional, and he looks forward to working with Mr. Leu.
  8. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)
A. General Comments
Director Creydt requested that the issue of note taking be added to a future meeting for discussion. Dr. Granger explained the statutory and policy requirement for the superintendent, as secretary of the board, to take meeting minutes, and he described his administrative assistant's role in helping with that process.
