4. Comments
A. Comments - Board of Directors
Cory Chase recognized Governor Inslee's announcement at his recent press conference regarding the lifting of the indoor
mask mandate on March 21st and expressed how happy he was to hear it. Cory explained that the Washougal School
District's plan is to continue to follow the law and Governor's orders until March 21st and we are waiting for the
Department of Health's updated guidance on other mitigating factors for transitioning to the lifting of the mandate.
Angela Hancock thanked Cory for clarifying points in the Governor's announcement and said we are all tired of it and look
forward to the local health department having control. Angela thanked the WLA team for their presentation and stated
that winter sports are wrapping up.

Jim Cooper said it is nice to see the state and country able to move forward in the pandemic and shared his concern
about the evolving situation with Russia and Ukraine. He also gave a shout-out to the Lady Panthers basketball team for
a very successful season and making it to state.
Chuck Carpenter mentioned that it's nice to see there are 32 people in attendance online and there were three written
comments submitted to the board and he appreciates all the feedback.
Sadie McKenzie said she was personally very impressed with the behavior of the high school students who peacefully
protested the mask mandate. She also said she is excited to see the end of masks in sight.
Angela Hancock said she forgot to mention that she had attended the Washougal High School play, Clue, and as always, it
was a great performance and she highly recommends attending.
B. Student Representatives
No students were in attendance.
C. Superintendentâ€™s Update
Superintendent Mary Templeton expressed the board's collective appreciation of Kori Kelly and Julie Ferguson for their
managing of the board meetings. She echoed Cory's enthusiasm about Governor Inslee's announcement of the upcoming
end of the mask mandate. She explained that masks will still be required on school busses because they fall under public
transportation, which is under a federal mandate. She stated that the Department of Health is scheduled to give updated
school guidance on March 7th. Mary shared some highlights of our Career and Technical Education department, while
reminding everyone that February is Career and Technical Education Month. A highlight of the program includes the
opening of the Panther Cafe in the Excelsior building, which is a breakfast bistro-style environment for students and staff
to enjoy breakfast. She gave kudos to Margaret Rice and her team for all their work in bringing exciting, innovative
opportunities to Washougal students. She also shared that Margaret was just nominated to be president of her
association as well as named the Southwest Washington CTE Administrator of the Year.
Mary went on to share memories of her sixth grade teacher, Mr. Reed and how he impacted not only her life, but the lives
of her siblings as well. It is a reminder of the "why" we do what we do.
D. Citizen Comments - General
Rebecca Keith, voter in the Washougal School District, thanked the board for enduring all that has gone on in the last year
and for paying attention to the science and following guidance given by professionals. She said there is a solid majority of
people who appreciate the work the board does.
Wendi Moose, parent of a Washougal student, thanked the board for following the Covid mandates to keep kids safe and
said she recognizes the sacrifices they make as volunteers. Wendi shared her concern about parents handing out items to
students outside of schools and hopes that parents know this is happening.
Melanie Wilson said she is speaking for Virginia Frederick, who could not be in attendance. She read Virginia's statement
which gave support of holding board meetings via Zoom due to a group of people who just wish to disrupt in-person
meetings. She asked the board to please consider making virtual meetings permanent.
Brandii Heaward, a Washougal resident, asked the board to make an official statement that the Washougal School District
will enforce optional mask wearing on March 21st. She also said she was shocked and appalled to see administrators
telling protesting students to go home when they refused to put on a mask and then, on a following day, they just locked
the students out which denied them of their free public education.
Friends of Washougal Moms Too & Skamania Defenders submitted written comment thanking the board for protecting
students and keeping them safe. They expressed concern that another group is taking up valuable time, impeding district
business and shutting down in-person meetings for their refusal to wear masks.
Mimi Latta submitted written public comment stating that Washougal's state-recognized board has been under attack for
requiring masks to be worn to protect our kids in accord with Washington State laws. She expressed her hope that our
newest board member will do her best to protect all our students' right to an excellent education and will diligently to
understand the curriculum.
Melanie Wilson of the East County Citizens' Alliance submitted written comment offering the group's continued support of
the Board and educators and staff within the district who have worked tirelessly to serve the community's children
throughout the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. She stated that the recent attempts to discredit school officials and
threatening individuals is unacceptable and incompatible with Washougal's traditional democratic and community values.
