YAKAMA LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Today, the schools of the Yakima School District rest on the ancestral lands of the fourteen
Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. The people of Yakama Nation inhabited
more than 12 million acres across Adams, Benton, Chelan, Douglas, Franklin, Grant, Kittitas,
Klickitat, and Yakima counties. Today, we honor those native peoples who are tied to the land
through history, legends, and culture. We acknowledge their descendants who live in the world
today.

We thank the caretakers of this land, who have lived here and continue to live here since time
immemorial. An acknowledgment is a simple, powerful way to show respect, and a step toward
correcting the stories and practices that erase indigenous peoples history and culture. It also
honors the truth. As a school district, we will continue to build upon our relations with the
Yakama Nation.

Legislative Update
MSOC:HB2494, the MSOC increase, passed the House on Saturday and is headed to the Senate for consideration. Under
the current version of the bill, the per pupil amounts defined in state prototypical formulas are updated in statute to the 202425 school year and include a $23 per pupil increase, from $1,519.04 to $1,542.04 per pupil.
Para staffing:SB5882, which increases staff allocations for paraeducators, office support staff, and non-instructional aides
in the prototypical school funding model, passed the full Senate 37-11 on Thursday and is awaiting action in the House
Appropriations Committee. This funds paras through the prototypical model and does not have a wage mandate as
proposed by Supt. Reykdal or Governor Inslee.
SpEd Cap:HB2180, which raises the special education enrollment cap from 15% to 17.25%, was pulled from the House
Rules Committee and is sitting on the House Floor Calendar awaiting a vote. Representative Travis Couture has posted a
striking amendment to the bill that would eventually eliminate the cap, and it is believedthat the majority party is seriously
considering the proposal.
Levy lift for regionalizeddistricts only:HB2215 and SB5956 did not advance out of committee and arelikelydead for the
session.
Inclusive Learning Standards:SB5462Promoting Inclusive Learning Standards and InstructionalMaterialisscheduled for
public hearing on 2/14 in House Education
Requires the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), in consultation with the Washington State
LGBTQ Commission, to review and update by December 1, 2024, relevant state learning standards at all grade
levels to include the histories, contributions, and perspectives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer
people.
Requires the Washington State School Directors' Association (WSSDA), with the assistance of the OSPI, to
review and update by June 1, 2025, a model policy and procedure that requires school district school boards to
adopt inclusive curricula and select diverse, equitable, inclusive, and age-appropriate instructional materials that
include the histories, contributions, and perspectives of historically marginalized and underrepresented groups.
