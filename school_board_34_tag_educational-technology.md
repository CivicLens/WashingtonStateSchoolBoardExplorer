The Kent School District No. 415 Board of Directors held a meeting on June 26, 2024, where they made several significant decisions. A key change was the removal of Item 7.02, which pertained to the acceptance of the City of Kent American Rescue Plan Act Federal Grant Fund for 2024-2026, due to pending updates in language and anticipated funding increases. This item is expected to be revisited in a future meeting. Additionally, the board approved a range of consent agenda items, including the Professional Services Agreement with Hazel Health and the Outdoor Schools Washington Grant Award. The meeting also featured a Child Nutrition Program update and a recognition of the 2023 National Board Certified Teachers, reflecting the district's commitment to community engagement and educational excellence.
