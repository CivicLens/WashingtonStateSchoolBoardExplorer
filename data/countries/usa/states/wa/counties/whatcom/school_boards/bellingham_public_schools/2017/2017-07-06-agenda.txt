Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director of Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
On June 27, 2013, the board adopted Resolution 14-13 which, among other things, specified the eligible capital improvements that
could be implemented using proceeds from the 2013 bond issue. The purpose of this evening's public hearing is to take public
testimony, both for and against a proposed amendment to Resolution 14-13 which will allow bond proceeds to be used to purchase an
existing building in lieu of constructing a new building.
The construction of a new central kitchen was always one of the specified projects in Resolution 14-13. At the time, we anticipated
constructing a new central kitchen and did not anticipate purchasing an existing building that would then be converted into a new central

kitchen. The proposed amendment to Resolution 14-13 will result in a minor wording change allowing bond proceeds to be used for the
purchase of an existing building in lieu of constructing a new building.
RCW 28A.530.020 requires a public hearing prior to amending the list of eligible projects associated with a bond issue.
This public hearing will be followed by a regular board meeting, beginning at 6:15, during which the board will take action on the
proposed amendment.
