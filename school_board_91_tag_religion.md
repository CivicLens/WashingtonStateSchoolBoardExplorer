The Pullman City Council held a regular meeting on February 27, 2024, where several key actions were taken. The Council extended the moratorium on enforcing electric scooters and bicycles until December 31, 2024, to facilitate mobility during the ongoing Project Downtown construction. This decision is linked to Resolution No. R-13-24, which amends the previous resolution regarding the moratorium's sunset date. Additionally, the Council authorized a contract with Spin for the provision of electric scooters and bicycles throughout the city, which will run until the end of 2024. The contract includes a provision for up to 100 electric scooters and 50 electric bicycles, with a fee structure involving a prorated annual fee and a per-ride fee. Concerns regarding helmet requirements and rider safety were discussed, with plans to enhance education and training on these issues. The meeting also featured a presentation on the Downtown Pullman Project, emphasizing community engagement and communication strategies during the construction phase.
