Audience:
• Michael Chrzastowski is a board member of the South Hill Neighborhood
Association and a South Hill representative to the Mayor’s Neighborhood Advisory
Commission. He spoke about the proposed ABC industrial metal shredder on Marine
Drive, near Alderwood Elementary School. He outlined concerns, including increased
truck traffic, noise and air-borne pollutants.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• It is the beginning of the official budget season for the state. The governor came out
with his priorities yesterday, and the legislature will begin its 60-day session in
January. It’s not expected that there will be any major changes in education funding.
Because of the budget work done last year, it’s not anticipated that there will be large
cuts in our district.
• Tomorrow is the last day before winter break. Dr. Baker shared photos from some
recent student performances in our schools and community. These events are
evidence of how our levies support the arts, clubs and student activities.
• The new district office construction project is going well. The drywall has been
installed, technology is beginning to go in, and it’s projected that the building will be
finished during second semester.
• Dr. Baker’s listening and learning tour has continued, with full days spent at Carl
Cozier and Columbia since the last board meeting.
• A gratitude meal has become a wonderful tradition at Options High School, giving
students an opportunity to share a turkey meal and time together. At the end of the
meal, leftovers are boxed up and sent home with students for the long weekend.
• The mayor’s holiday card featured artwork of two Lowell Elementary School
students.
• This will be the first year that Treaty Day, January 22, will be a non-school day.
Teachers have access to instructional materials to support learning about Treaty Day.
• Our first winter event for all students and families, Winter Blast, will be 5-8 p.m. on
Friday, Feb. 23, 2024 at the SportsPlex. This will be similar to the annual Block Party
that has been held in the summer.
• Levy elections will be in February, with all districts in Whatcom County running at
least one levy. We have two replacement levies on the ballot and they fund
approximately 25% of our budget. Dr. Baker gave a brief overview of what is covered
by our local levies. Informational videos will be going out after the first of the year,
highlighting how levies help to fund staff, programs and opportunities for our
students.
• Tonight’s consent agenda contains monitoring reports for EL-7 and EL-9, and Dr.
Baker shared some highlights from those reports.
Dr. Baker responded to questions from the board.

GP-7.2 – 2023-24 Annual Board Agenda, Revised – general review.
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Diaz Hackler noted that since the last meeting she attended the WSSDA
conference in Bellevue and attended the Bellingham High School board visit. She

attended a session at the WSSDA conference that was helpful to her in her personal
life. She loved visiting Bellingham High School. She also shared that she is registered
to attend the Legislative Conference/Day on the Hill in January.
Ms. Rose thought the WSSDA conference was great, and she values the unstructured
time spent with the other board members. She also enjoyed the Bellingham High
School visit and liked the variety of education sectors represented, including the arts,
the engineering classroom and the sports training program. She believes students feel
supported in their pursuits. She believes the school visits are the best part of serving
on the school board.
Mr. Ritchey found the WSSDA conference to be beneficial and well-executed. The
time with the other board members was very useful and he was grateful for the ideas
that were shared. He recently volunteered at Kulshan Middle School’s fall festival.
Middle school students have a lot of energy, and he thought the staff did a great job of
handling the borderline chaos. The students did a great job cleaning up after the
event, which is indicative of the great culture at the school.
Ms. Mason loved the Bellingham High School visit. It demonstrated that students
finding things they love helps them to feel connected in school. This is evidence of
how important the replacement levies are. The WSSDA conference was great, and it
was good to spend time together as a board. It was also good to hear what is going on
in other districts, and she is grateful to be in this district. She shared that her daughter
recently was able to have a friend ride home with her on the bus. It is evidence of the
incredible amount of work being done with inclusion, including specialized
transportation, which has benefited so many students.
Mr. Benjamin attended the strategic advocacy pre-conference at WSSDA, which was
the first time it has been offered. He would recommend it to the other board members
if it is offered in future years. During a recent WSSDA board meeting, each director
was asked to share something to be grateful for. Mr. Benjamin read a letter from an
Options High School parent. He agreed that school visits are always a favorite board
activity. He is nearly done reading Confessions of a School Reformer, which he
believes is an amazing history lesson, and he would recommend it.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The board is impressed with the work Happy Valley Elementary has made with the Since Time
Immemorial curricular resources.
The report we were given shows evidence that the superintendent has made progress over the past
year towards a culturally diverse workforce.
Notes are the expansion of EDI professional development and partnerships with outside
organizations to promote the intent of this policy.
We are also impressed with evidence of increased connection and services to diverse families and
students. We noticed the evidence during our site visits and by the hiring of bilingual front office
staff members.
Finally, we would also like to highlight the panel of multilingual students who presented to the
Department of Teaching and Learning. That provides evidence of continued efforts to improve
graduation rates and shows that our students are cared for and respected.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
Continue the great work. The superintendent has done an incredible job of putting EDI into action
at every level.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• 96 policies where no WSSDA model exists.

actively monitor required and best practices policies, updating policies actively as needed, and
communicating those to staff.

administrative policies and procedures.
JM:

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
DB:
• This is an area where the superintendent well exceeds expectations and has consistently done
so during his years with the district.
• The list of board updates is extensive.
• The frequency of reaching out to the board with important information is almost daily, and
often multiple times a day.
• The opportunities created for the board to receive input from students, our schools and the
greater community are consistently well planned and precisely meet the requests of the board.
CDH:
• The superintendent has continued to do an excellent job in keeping us informed and updated
through emails, in person meetings, roundtables, linkages and study sessions.
JM:
• Consistent communication to the board on a VERY wide range of topics (also, this report is a
good reminder of how many reminder-worthy things go on during the year!).
• Ample opportunities for education around specific topics and participation in events.
• This is an area done very well. Communication with the Board is quick and consistent but not
overwhelming. It does a great job in supporting our roles.
