Presenter:
Jackie Maddux
Board President
Background:
Since 2011, school boards across Washington State have participated in the Washington State School Directors' Association
(WSSDA) Board Self-Assessment, which is based on the five Washington School Board Standards. The report generated by the
survey questions is thorough and thought-provoking. Participating boards report that analyzing this data as a team leads to rich
and productive discussions.
The data is organized in a color-coded, horizontal-stacked bar chart that shows Battle Ground Public Schools Board of Directors
results at the level of the five standards. The explanation for the color code is just above the data chart. Subsequent pages show
the data from each question, withthe page header showing the standard and benchmark the question relates to.
