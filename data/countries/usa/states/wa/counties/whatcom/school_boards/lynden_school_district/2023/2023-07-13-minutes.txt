8. Information from Board Members
9. Board Workshop
The board discussed components of the School Board Handbook that could be considered for
change, elimination, as well as any potential additions. This is a working board document and its
intent for use is to provide a summary of the governing approach of the Lynden School Board. It
gives an overview of how the Board carries out its responsibilities and will also be used as part of
an onboarding process for future new board members.
Director Petersen expressed that the handbook is repetitive, cumbersome, and hard to follow,
and needs to be reformatted. She offered to work on the document to reduce redundancy, and
reformat and reorganize the content.
The group agreed to accept Cindy’s offer and were asked to email their suggestions to her, which
she can include in the revised version.
10. Adjourn Meeting to go into Work Session
David Vis motioned to adjourn the meeting at 8:13.
11. Work Session
A draft of the long range Capital Facilities Plan was presented to the board for discussion.
Members of the long range Capital Facilities Planning group were in attendance to answer
questions.
The discussion began with an explanation about the purpose and goals of the facilities planning
group, and their intention to remain student-focused during the process. Factors that were taken

into consideration and discussed during this process included enrollment projections and building
capacities, and the group worked with the City of Lynden regarding future development plans.
The intent of this document is to be able to provide clarity on current and future facility needs
and be able to plan ahead on the need for funding.
Tim Faber explained that their work was built off of the Study and Survey that was recently done.
This document is intended to be reviewed annually and adjusted as needed depending on what is
happening in development and enrollment. When needs of the district come up such as bonds or
levies, there is now a document that explains why and how it came about.
CJ Costanti asked if there were any surprises during this process. Kevin Burke explained the older
buildings were built for a different type of “business” and there are inadequacies in those
buildings because the nature of serving students has evolved and changed. Another challenge
was looking at capacity with regards to enrollment and the addition of portables at some of the
schools. We cannot continue to support students by adding more portables - the lack of central
services is a problem.
We will need a fourth elementary school. The presented plan recommends a fourth elementary
school once the elementary population reaches 1,600, which enrollment projections show may
be in 2035/2036. This number/ timeline will need to be flexible depending on enrollment,
funding, and other factors.
Lynden Academy is currently serving students in a leased building which expires in 2029. The
Board expressed the importance of Lynden Academy and ensuring facility needs are understood
and addressed.
A performing arts center is needed and proposed at the high school. This may result in
decommissioning Judson Hall, but this group is recommending that the board has further
discussion involving that decision as there may be community interest in keeping Judson Hall.
The high school is a big concern in the community as well. A recommendation involving the high
school is provided in the plan and includes a gym renovation and the building of a new high
school.
This group is hopeful that the recommended plan will help with short term planning as well,
specifically with regards to building new schools and the passing of bonds. We would like to be
proactive and transparent in our future planning so that the community is consistently aware of
next steps.
David Vis called the business meeting back to order at 9:17pm.

Superintendent Evaluation
Directors Owsley and Costanti presented the board members with a draft of Superintendent
VanderYacht’s annual evaluation. This draft is based on the WSSDA framework that was slightly
modified to align with the work at Lynden School District.
Director Petersen suggested that a superintendent self-assessment be part of the evaluation in
the future. In addition, all directors agreed that they would like to be able to provide input to the
evaluation committee in the future.
The Board unanimously agreed that the draft of the superintendent evaluation be accepted.
The Board then discussed the superintendent contract. A draft was presented which proposed
rolling forward the contract from last year with an added year of 2025/2026 and deferring the
$5,000 increase from 2024/2025 to 2025/2026. It also changed the requirement of a yearly
evaluation timeline to May 31st and renewal of contract decision done by June 15th of each year.
Tonya Hickman motioned to approve the extended contract as presented with an amended date
for devoting all or a portion of at least one meeting to discuss the superintendent’s evaluation on
Section 3, Page 3 to May 31st instead of June 15th. Cindy Petersen seconded. Motion carried by
voice vote.
Board Vote 5-0; Advisory Vote 1-0
David Vis adjourned the meeting at 9:51pm.
