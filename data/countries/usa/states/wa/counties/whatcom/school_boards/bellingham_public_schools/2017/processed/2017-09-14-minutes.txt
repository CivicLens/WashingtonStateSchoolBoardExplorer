DRAFT MINUTES OF THE REGULAR BOARD MEETING
WITH STUDY SESSION
BELLINGHAM SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF DIRECTORS
September 14, 2017
OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
6:15 p.m. – 1306 Dupont St., Bellingham, Washington
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Mr. Benjamin called the meeting to order at 6:15 p.m. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw,
Douglas Benjamin (President), Camille Diaz Hackler, Quenby Peterson, Steven Smith,
Superintendent Greg Baker, and recorder Ruth Rasmussen.
Audience – n/a
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
 Freeman High School: One student was killed and several wounded during this
week’s shooting incident at this Spokane high school. Dr. Baker sent a message to
families, staff and community regarding the incident and has reached out to the
school with offers of support.
 Enrollment: Our district’s enrollment is currently over original projections by
approximately 200 students.
 2017-18 Budget update: Dr. Baker met last week with State Superintendent Chris
Reykdal and a group of district superintendents to discuss the recently approved state
budget. Educators around the state continue to analyze the impact to their districts.
Interpretations of various key provisions of the state budget – for example, the
enrichment levy -- vary significantly.
 1:1 Technology: The rollout at the three pilot schools (Kulshan Middle School,
Options and Squalicum high schools) is going well, thanks in part to the district’s
investment in professional development, the hiring of tech coaches, scheduling of
family informational nights, and creation of a handbook for students and families
with common Q&As. Dr. Smith asked that Dr. Baker continue to keep the board
informed on this topic, either through periodic updates or a study session at the end of
the school year.
 Start/End Times: As evidenced by comments on Dr. Baker’s blog, the new high
school schedule has yielded positive comments in general; however, some families
are still challenged by the elementary start times, particularly if they have been
impacted by changed bus schedules. The district will continue to work on addressing
these concerns by analyzing and refining bus routes where possible.
 4x8 High School Schedule: Students and families are continuing to adjust to the new
schedule, but overall this initiative is going well.
 Drivers Education Course: The administrative team is exploring the possibility of
offering this to students beginning in the 2018-19 school year.
