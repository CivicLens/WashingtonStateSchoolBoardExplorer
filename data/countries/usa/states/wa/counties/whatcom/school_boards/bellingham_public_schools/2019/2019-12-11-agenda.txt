RMC Architects.
After interviews, the team deliberated over these two closely matched firms. One firm emerged as best qualified for this project RMC Architects. RMC has been deeply rooted in our community for over 30 years and proven themselves as a competent firm
with connections to known and well-established consultants. They have been instrumental in the development of the Barkley
area for the last 20 years. RMC is a Bellingham firm with long-standing positive relationships throughout the community. We are
pleased and excited to enter into a partnership with RMC for what will be our next great project.
Our recommendation is that the board approve the district entering into contract negotiations with RMC Architects for services
related to the New District Office project.
