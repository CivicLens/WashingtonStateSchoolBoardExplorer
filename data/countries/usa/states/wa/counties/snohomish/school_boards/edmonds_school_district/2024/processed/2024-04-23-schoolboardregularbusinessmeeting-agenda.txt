Budget Source :

2020 Capital/Technology Levy

Recommended Action :

That the board of directors approve a purchase of
Chromebooks to support the 2024-25 9th-grade, 5th-

grade, 1st-grade students, and edCAP as part of the 2020
Technology/Capital Levy.

Public Content
Information:
The 2020 Technology/Capital Levy allocates funds on an annual basis to ensure students at all schools
have access to a learning device, as part of the districts one-to-one initiative. In accordance with the
districts student technology replacement plan, this purchase will provide a new device to 2024-25s 1st
grade, 5th grade, 9th grade, and EdCAP students, which will be assigned to and retained by them for the
following four school years.
Background:
The student technology replacement plan provides for each student learning device to be replaced after
four school years of use. This ensures that each student has a functioning learning device. In addition, it
has afforded the district the ability to recoup some value from replaced technology, which has been used
to offset on-going hardware repair costs.
In anticipation of this purchase, the district requested evaluation hardware and pricing from several
manufacturers that offer Chromebooks which meet our specifications. Currently, the district has a
standard feature-set that includes both a touch-screen and a convertible form-factor. After conducting
benchmark testing, evaluating pricing and features, and considering the potential lead time on deliveries,
among other factors, it is recommended that we leverage Asus for district Chromebook purchases at this
time.
This purchase includes Chromebook devices for 2024-25s EdCAP, 1st grade, 5th grade, and 9th grade
students as well as the spare equipment needed to ensure each student has access to the device that
they need for learning, each day. This purchase will be made leveraging the Omnia contract, a
competitively bid purchasing contract that is compliant with Washington State bid guidelines.
This purchase also includes 4 years of warranty coverage and accidental damage support from the
manufacturer. Accidental damage support allows the district to send damaged devices to the
manufacturer for repair. This support, in partnership with the district's in-house repairs, increases the
availability of our fleet so that student devices are more readily available. It is also expected to reduce
ongoing general fund expenses related to Chromebook repairs.

payment of goods and contract services are approved by the auditing officer and then listed on voucher registers which
are presented to the board for approval at the next regular meeting. Board approval of district disbursements is
required by RCW 42.24.080. Vouchers audited and certified by the auditing office required by RCW 42.24.080, and
those expense reimbursement claims certified by RCW 42.24.090 have been recorded and the listing made available to
the Board.

Second Reading, Approve Resolution #24-09, 2024-2025 Reduced Educational Program
Background:
Due to a variety of factors the district is facing a budget shortfall for 2024-25. In order to reduce the district's expenditures to the level of
anticipated revenues, it is necessary for the district to make reductions in the educational program, including reductions of both certificated

and classified positions. Attached is the recommended reduced educational program reflecting identified reductions. This is a second
reading and recommendation for approval. It is necessary to have board approval of the Reduced Educational Program resolution in order to
notify affected certificated employees by May 15, 2024 as required by law. These numbers may change as we process additional resignation
and retirement requests. After the reduction, recall will be processed according to the applicable bargaining agreement.

Final decisions regarding the entire 2024-25 budget will be completed in time for the budget public
hearing in July. We are still processing the feedback we received from the Balancing Act survey as well
as the feedback submitted via the Google form on our district website. We are very grateful to those who
completed the survey and provided comments and feedback.

Information:
Approval of change order Authorization for the MTHS HVAC Replacement Project in the amount of
$799,439.71. The Capital Projects Office has determined that certain HVAC equipment requires
immediate procurement to ensure delivery for installation in the summer of 2024. The design of the
summer 2025 work also needs to be completed to establish the guaranteed maximum price for that work.
Background:
The MTHS HVAC Replacement project was identified in the 2021 Capital Levy approved by district voters
in April 2021. At its December 12, 2023, regular business meeting, the Board of Directors authorized the
Progressive Design-Build contract award to Hermanson Company, LLP of Kent, WA for $488,916 for
GMP Development Services.
The Capital Projects office recommends that the School Board authorize this Change Order to proceed
with the procurement of HVAC equipment for this project. If the Board of Directors approves this item, the
Capital Projects Office would immediately initiate the purchase of HVAC equipment and request the
commencement of Summer 2025 Design through the PDB Preconstruction contract with Hermanson
Company, LLP.
When the District and the Progressive Design team have negotiated a Guaranteed Maximum Price
Amendment for this Summer 2024 and Amendment for Summer 2025 projects, District staff would
recommend School Board approval at those times.
This project is funded by the 2021 Capital Levy.

from Oak Heights Elementary School.

Public Content
Information:
Approval of the contract to move the eight relocatable classrooms from Oak Heights to various locations
throughout the District for the demolition and construction commencement of Oak Heights Elementary in
July of 2024. These classrooms will be relocated to the following locations:
1 Sherwood Elementary
1 - Stadium

2 Hilltop Elementary
1 Woodway Center
1 Edmonds Woodway High School
2 Former Alderwood Middle School (one double portable)
Background:
With the success of the Bond vote in February of 2024 to replace Oak Heights Elementary School,
construction will commence in summer 2024. District Administrators have determined that the existing
portables at HTE and the Stadium are obsolete and in poor condition. These will be replaced by three
coming from Oak Heights. One portable going to Woodway Center will augment capacity at this interim
site. The remaining relocatable classrooms will address capacity needs at SWE, EWH and FAM.
If the Board of Directors approves this item, the Capital Projects Office will proceed with the planning to
move these relocatable classrooms during the summer of 2024. Use of the KCDA contract meets bid
regulations.
This project will be completed by August 31, 2024, and is funded by the 2021 Levy.
