The Bellingham School District Board of Directors met on July 6, 2017, to discuss various topics, including updates on the 2017-18 budget and compliance with academic standards. Superintendent Greg Baker reported that the analysis of the newly approved state budget is ongoing, with key implications for the districtâ€™s finances, particularly regarding the delay of the levy cliff until 2018, allowing for the collection of voter-approved Maintenance and Operations levy funds. 

The board reviewed and approved several consent agenda items, including minutes from previous meetings, investments, and expenditures. Notably, the board addressed the monitoring report on EL-6, Academic Standards and Practices, and made changes to the policy to emphasize the involvement of stakeholder groups and the review of academic content and curriculum. The revisions included a new monitoring frequency of annually in March and a motion to remove specific month references in monitoring frequencies across all EL policies. Additionally, board member Camille Diaz Hackler reported her observations of the free lunch distribution process at the Sportsplex, demonstrating community engagement in district programs.
