  3. Public Comment
A. Public Comment
The following individual addressed the board regarding topics of concern:
Natalie Chavez described examples of students becoming ill after receiving the COVID vaccine. She distributed an article on that topic to each director and expressed her hope that the district will provide teachers with resources to support students who experience a reaction to the COVID vaccine.
  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Monthly Reports
Each school administrator reviewed their monthly report to the board.
Blaine Primary School: Michelle McKeown reported and discussion followed regarding
the Book Fair and student attendance.
Blaine Elementary School: Jordan Radke reported and no discussion followed.
Blaine Middle School: Darren Benson reported and discussion followed regarding House
Olympics and this year's lip dub video.
Blaine High School: Scott Ellis reported and no discussion followed.

President Thomas shared comments commending the campus administrators for their efforts, in response to the recent staff survey, to build community with their staff through the activities that were described in their reports. He expressed his appreciation for their work, and the work of the district, in responding to suggestions that came out of the survey themes.
  B. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment through the month of November which has declined to September's level. It is not unusual for October's count to be higher, and the district's enrollment remains well below the budgeted level. The deficit of 52 FTE  is mostly due to low kindergarten enrollment. Planning for next year will be significantly more conservative, and new staff will only be added once the need is confirmed. Discussion followed regarding declining trends identified in the county's birth records that may result in continued low enrollment for future years. 
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of October which included large deposits from that month's property tax revenue collection. Ms. Porter described her intent to develop a dashboard format, as previously requested by Director Leu, for presentation of the district's financial data. There was discussion regarding Ms. Porter's anticipation that future expenditures, particularly in staffing, will accelerate faster than in prior years. She explained how the district's receipt of federal stimulus money resulted in a higher fund balance for this year. Higher rates of pay are a factor in the district's elevated staffing expense which is no longer sustainable. Discussion continued regarding the district's current level of staffing which can no longer be supported due to low enrollment. With the expectation that enrollment will continue to decline, it has become impossible to maintain the current staffing level.
  D. WSSDA Conference Review
Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger, President Thomas, and Directors Gibson and Leu recently attended the annual WSSDA conference in Spokane. They each shared a summary of the information learned. President Thomas described the law conference as engaging and informative. He also learned a lot about bonds and levies in the breakout sessions. Director Gibson appreciated the review of first amendment rights at the law conference. He also shared information from the suicide prevention breakout session. Director Leu was also struck by the first amendment presentation at the law conference. He attended breakout sessions on bonds and levies which provided insight on the importance of community engagement rather than simply putting out signs to vote which often reminds opposition voters to come out against a school initiative. President Thomas described how impressed he was with one attorney presenter who grew up in Whatcom County.
    E. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
WSSDA Conference: Dr. Granger expressed his appreciation for the board members who followed through on their commitment to take part in the annual conference where they were engaged with a broader learning community.
Equity Work: The district's leadership team has been working to hear student feedback. Student advisory panels have been held in grades 3-12 and a primary school panel will take place soon.
2023 Legislative Session: Despite news reports of large state revenues, the state's expenses have increased just like the district's have. Dr. Granger does not anticipate a big influx of additional state funding for K-12 schools. With the loss of federal stimulus funding, the need for reductions in school staffing must be addressed. Following a state-commissioned study of school staffing needs, the upcoming legislative session will include a review of how to fund schools in a way that supports proper staffing. McCleary salary compensation levels will also be revisited.
Student Absences: All schools have experienced significant absences recently due to weather and illness. The local hospital capacity is stretched with flu, RSV, and COVID. Families are being encouraged to keep students home when sick. Masks can be used, if desired, to help limit the spread of illness. Weather and road conditions are being actively monitored with snow in the forecast. President Thomas asked if the school calendar has built-in make-up days for school closure, and Dr. Granger explained that the option of including make-up days within the school year was rejected in the vote of certificated staff.
