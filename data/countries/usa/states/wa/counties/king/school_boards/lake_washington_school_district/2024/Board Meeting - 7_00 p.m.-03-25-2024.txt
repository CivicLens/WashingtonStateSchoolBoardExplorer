1. Redirecting 2022 Construction Levy Proceeds And
Matching Funds Resolution No. 2365

Meeting :

Mar 25, 2024 - Board Meeting - 7:00 p.m.

Type :

Discussion, Information

Public Content
SITUATION
In October of 2021, the board passed Resolution No. 2321 authorizing a special election on February 8, 2022 in order to propose
a $295 million six-year capital construction levy. The levy proceeds were to be used to complete the first phase of projects in the
districts Building Excellence Plan. The projects included additions to three middle schools; new elementary capacity on the
Redmond elementary campus, new high school capacity in the Lake Washington/ Redmond/Eastlake areas, acquiring property,
and other capital projects. The six- year levy election passed, and the district is currently collecting the proceeds in calendar
years 2023 through 2028.
In April of 2023, the board passed Resolution No. 2345 authorizing the repurposing of 2022 levy funds from Redmond
Elementary campus to rebuild/enlarge Rockwell Elementary and the 2019 and 2022 capital construction levy proceeds and
SCAP funds to be redirected so that they also may be used for capital construction projects to serve the districts aging facilities
and capacity needs. These include rebuild and enlarge projects for aging schools; facility additions; and other capacity projects
including portables, upgrades to classrooms, future bond and levy planning, internal building modifications and property
acquisition.
In October 2023, the board passed Resolution No. 2361 authorizing repurposed of 2022 levy funds to add a gymnasium facility
to the 600-student capacity High School Project in Sammamish (Site 59).
In late Fall district staff and City of Sammamish staff discussed evolving permitting requirements which would impact the
schedule resulting in a delay of construction by one year. Unanticipated right-of-way improvements were required resulting in
additional $14-$15 million in costs. In addition, the 5-month focus group work and community engagement provided no preferred
options for educational programing to meet desired capacity relief for recommendations that would relieve capacity at both
Redmond and Eastlake High School.
Therefore, the recommendation is to hold on Site 59 development and repurpose levy funds to provide classroom and core
space additions at Eastlake and Redmond High Schools. District staff shared information regarding the recommendation at the
February 5 and March 16 study session and will present information at this meeting.
The rationale for the recommendation is as follows:
Addresses individual capacity needs at both Eastlake and Redmond High School by providing each school with up to 300student permanent capacity additions to serve the current and projected student population at Eastlake and Redmond
High Schools
Provides funds for core space additions where feasible (overall capacity may be decreased due to core space
modifications)
Reduces the reliance on portables
Addresses capacity at the same or lower cost as the original Site 59 construction budget
Invests levy funds in permanent infrastructure that can be used in the short and long-terms
Completes projects by Fall 2026 in the same timeline as the revised Site 59 construction plan
While prior resolutions allowed funds to be used on any capital project, given the elimination of one project and replacing it with
another, this will be brought for board action. Resolution 2365 and Resolution 2366, redirecting construction levy funds, will be
placed on the April 15, 2024 agenda for board action. The proposed resolutions is attached.

Resolution 2365 authorizes the 2022 capital construction levy proceeds and SCAP funds to be redirected so that they can be
used for up to a 12-classroom additions and core space modifications at Eastlake High School (Site 86) and Redmond High
School (Site 85).
The resolution also directs the superintendent to do the following:
Prepare a study on the feasibility, engagement/community considerations, financing, and implementation plan for the
evaluation of a 5th Comprehensive High School by March 2025
Prepare a study on the alternatives to addressing high school enrollment such as (1) do nothing, (2) additional choice
school options and (3) district wide reboundary using current facilities by March 2025.
Previous resolutions continue to allow use for any capital construction projects to serve the districts aging facilities and capacity
needs. These include rebuild and enlarge projects for aging schools; facility additions; and other capacity projects including
portables, upgrades to classrooms, future bond and levy planning, internal building modifications and property acquisition.
RECOMMENDATION
The Board of Directors will take formal action on the recommendation regarding redirecting 2022 Construction Levy proceeds
and matching funds as outlined in Resolution No. 2365 at the April 15, 2024 board meeting.

Recommended Action :

The Board adopts the proposed WSSDA positions as
presented.

Public Content
Annually, the Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA) creates, revises, and confirms Permanent and
Legislative Positions. Permanent positions are those positions that "represent WSSDAs beliefs and values and indicate
WSSDAs stance on issues of widespread concern for its membership. The permanent positions are advisory to individual school
boards and the greater community." Legislative positions are those that are, "WSSDAs call to action directed at the state
Legislature. These member-ratified positions define and direct the work of WSSDAs staff as they engage with legislators in
Olympia to support public education."
The LWSD Board is recommending revision to current positions and the adoption of new positions.
Climate Impact Mitigation Assistance:
Revisions to existing legislative position to be more general about alternative fuels (rather than just specifying electric) and
encourage funding for non-vehicle related costs e.g. infrastructure.
Funding Safe, Healthy, Contemporary School Buildings:

Revisions to existing legislative position to add language supporting contracting indebtedness to construct new school buildings
(i.e. LGO bonds)
Literacy:
Two positions one permanent, one legislative affirming literacy as a civil right and encouraging funding for evidence-based
literacy practices.These positions are being worked on in collaboration with the Shoreline School District Board of Directors.
After adoption, these positions would be submitted on behalf of the Board for consideration by the WSSDA Membership at
General Assembly in September 2024.
