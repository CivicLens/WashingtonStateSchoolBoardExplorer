OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
6 p.m. – Feb. 7, 2018 - 1306 Dupont St., Bellingham, Washington
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Bashaw called the meeting to order at 6 p.m. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw
(President,) Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler, Jenn Mason, Quenby Peterson,
Superintendent Greg Baker, and Ruth Rasmussen (recorder)
Audience: Daniel Hagins: Referencing the superintendent’s recent message regarding a
new Traffic Safety and Financial Education course beginning in 2018-19, Mr. Hagins
said he wanted to encourage the district to address the cost of insurance in future
communications to families.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report:
 Traffic Safety course: Dr. Baker said this course is included in the 2018-19 High
School Course Catalog. Response to Dr. Baker’s recent message has generally
been positive. Administrators welcome opportunities to meet with families or
community members who have questions or wish to provide feedback.
 Promise K: The first day of school was Jan. 29. The program, offered at six sites,
has 100-plus students enrolled. Administrators from other districts interested in
starting similar programs are calling on a regular basis to learn more about our
district’s experience.
 School Board Special Meeting: Dr. Baker briefly reviewed the agenda for this
two-day meeting scheduled for Feb. 23 & 24 at North Cascades Institute.
 Despite the Best Intentions by Amanda Lewis and John Diamond: The entire
leadership team is reading this book and finding it highly relevant to the district’s
work on equity.
 2018-19 Bond: The Herald featured an article on the bond and Dr. Baker’s blog
has an updated message. Volunteers with Citizens for Bellingham Schools have
been engaged in a variety of tasks as Election Day approaches. Dr. Baker has
given informational presentations at staff meeting as well as to all PTA groups
and to many civic and community organizations. Mr. Benjamin reflected on the
process involved in placing a bond measure on the ballot, noting that the directors
carefully study the bond’s full impact before accepting the superintendent’s
recommendation to approve a bond resolution. He said it is important that this
process is emphasized when communicating to the public on future bonds and
levies.



Central Kitchen Work: The board heard an update from Ron Cowan, Executive
Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities; Patrick Durgan, Executive Chef
and Director of Food Services; and Jessica Sankey, Director, Teaching and
Learning – Wellness. The group summarized the work done to date on the Central
Kitchen and discussed how the Bellingham Good Food Promise informs that
work. The Bellingham Public Schools Foundation and community partners,
including Whatcom Community Foundation, have been key supporters of this
work.

Dr. Baker noted that minor revisions have been made to the attachments in Consent Agenda
Items No. 2.5 and 2.6.

POLICY GOVERNANCE REVIEW
Monitoring Report Ends 2.1 (part 2) – Student Competence
Dr. Mike Copland, Deputy Superintendent, and Brian Rick, Director of Research and
Assessment, discussed the report and data set and answered questions from the board.
The report focused on Student Advancement Toward On-Time or Extended Graduation
and Reduction in Drop-Out Rates. Dr. Copland and Mr. Rick noted that overall trends are
positive and affirm the efficacy of strategies that have been in place for several years.
These include the district’s investments in ELL instruction, hiring of success coordinators
in each of the schools, and the work of the family engagement team. The focus of the
leadership team on reducing suspensions, along with the “94 project” (engaging with
former students who did not complete high school) also contributed to positive trends.
Dr. Copland acknowledged Mr. Rick’s contributions to these reports and expressed
appreciation for the level of integrity he brings to the process.

Board Response to Monitoring – Ends 2.1 part 1:
 At the January 10, 2018 regular meeting, the board heard a monitoring report, which
included a data set, on Ends 2.1 (part 1) Student Competence. In accordance with
Policy Governance, the board discussed whether the superintendent has achieved the
goals established in the policy. (See Attachment A for a summary of comments.) The
directors agreed that at a future meeting, when revisions to the policy are considered,
they would explore further whether the wording relating to “comparable highperforming districts” should be clarified.
