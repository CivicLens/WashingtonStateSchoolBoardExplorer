3. Public Comment
A. Public Comment
Vice President Simpson called for Public Comment.
Kate Kruller - Community Member - Shared that someone had breached the fence at Cascade View over the weekend. Is the
Board informed or given a report when breaches happen? What are the next steps in the process for becoming a Board Director?
Currently District 2 has a community that is going unrepresented at this time.

4. Discussion Items
A. Budget
Amy Fleming, Chief Financial Officer shared the 24-25 budget presentation with the Board of Directors.
The presentation included the strategic plan, budget development timeline, fund balance projection, enrollment projections,
budget reduction recommendations, and next steps.
2024-2025 Budget Development
The strategic plan is our guide and what drives our work. One of our main focuses for budget development this year is to work
on bringing the district to a balanced budget and getting us to a zero-fund balance. A zero fund balance is a requirement to
remain in compliance with our binding conditions document with OSPI and PSESD. ESSER funding ends August 31, 2024,
totaling $5.9 million. Our estimated 23-24 fund balance is negative $3.5 million to negative $4.4 million.
Director Larson asked how much is our outstanding inter-fund loan. CFO Fleming shared that we currently have $4 million in an
inter-fund loan. This was cash borrowing from the capital projects fund to keep us afloat.
Director Larson asked if this amount
is included in the projected ending fund balance. Does this include paying off the inter-fund loan? CFO Fleming shared that the
inter-fund loan will be in addition to this. The zero fund balance is a long-range two (2) year plan, getting us to financial stability
and building our reserves to 4% which is required through binding conditions. This will then give us the capability to repay the
capital projects fund for the loan. Director Larson commented that the more accurate situation is at the end of 23-24 it's more
like a $7.5M to $8.4M deficit with the outstanding $4M inter-fund loan. CFO Fleming shared that the cash balance does not come
into play in your fund balance conversation. Essentially, to get us whole, we will need to work on the plan for those additional
reductions to get us back to stability.
Timeline
We have a requirement by state law to have a budget approved by the Board of Directors and submitted to OSPI by August 31.
As information came forth as to where we stood financially, Dr. Pedroza was out in the community, having conversations with the
Board, staff, PTA, etc. In previous budgets, there was community outreach, however, the community didn't really come to the
table, and therefore there wasn't a lot of input received. The slide shows the engagement that has happened, as well as future
engagements, including scheduling two (2) Zoom sessions, in May and June, so the public can provide input for our budget and
budget process.
The projected fund balance is in draft form. This has not yet been updated but will be updated for the April 23rd Board Meeting.
This slide was provided for context.
Budget Development Outlook - Roll Over Budget
If we assumed a 2% increase in Revenue and a 3% increase in expenditures, our ending fund balance next year, without making
any reductions, and with the loss of ESSER funding, would be negative $13.2M. This does not take into consideration the $4M
inter-fund loan.
Enrollment - Historical and Projected
We have seen a large increase due to the influx of asylum seekers coming to our community. Historically, enrollment has been
declining. Enrollment is one our our basic funding allocation methods from the state. If we project too high, and fund teachers
and other staff members off those high projections, we will be in the same situation we are in currently. Moving forward, our
enrollment projects will be conservative, and we will be monitoring throughout the summer to determine what the enrollment is
truly looking like. Currently, we are predicting an enrollment of 2,557 FTE students.
Proposed Budget Reductions
Budget reductions as we look to the 24-25 school year. With ESSER funding ending, as well as the 21st Century Grant, the
proposals for cuts are all across the board. There are also contract reductions.
Director Larson shared thoughts on "how we got here":
Loss of ESSER funding
BEA underfunded by state
State underfunding of Paid Family and Medical Leave Act (PFMLA)
Substitute costs not covered
Increased costs - insurance, MSOC
Some elements of the Bargaining Agreements that increase costs or reduce the opportunities for increased revenues.
Director Simpson shared that he would like the $4M inter-fund loan included on future reports.
Board Budget Priorities

Director Larson reviewed the communication from PSESD/OSPI regarding binding conditions. Director Larson shared that he met
with John Welch, PSESD to get clarification on ranked budget priorities. The priorities do not need to be ranked in numerical
order.
Make meaningful PD available for staff to increase their understanding and accountability of SEL practices
Maintain/Increase students' connectedness to school through identity and interest-based enrichment programs. Specifically for
socially and systemically marginalized students
Recruit and retain diverse staff that represent the varying identities of our student population
Increase training and accountability around racial and gender-based bias for staff
Focus on students two or more grade levels behind, MLL students
Financial stability
Physical safety of our students.
Changes to Budget Priorities Document:
Add accountability after the word "practices"
Add - Ensure Financial Stability
Add Physical to the beginning of the "well-being of our student population..." statement
Add as the first statement of the document: "All of our scholars receive the highest quality of instruction to succeed while
in our school community and beyond high school".
Add "Ensure that staff are equipped with the tools and resources they need".
The Board Philosophy is fine at this time. The Board will get more focused on each statement at future meetings.
B. Strategic Plan - Engaged Learners
Scott Whitbeck, Chief Academic Officer, and Dr. Allison Deno, Executive Director of Multilingual Services & PK-12 Education,
presented the Strategic Plan - Engaged Learners to the Board.
Engaged Learners
Desired Outcome:
Student learning increases as a result of students taking an active role in their own goal-setting and progress monitoring.
Goal: Percentage of students setting personal academic growth goals - 100% of students in grades K-8 will set student growth
goals in reading and math after they have taken the iReady diagnostic in the fall.
Mid-Year progress:
Tukwila Elementary nearly met the goal of 100% participation, while Cascade View and Thorndyke made some progress
toward the goal. Showalter was farthest from meeting the goal.
For all schools, these percentages were impacted by the fact that numerous families have enrolled after the fall
conference window had closed.
Desired Outcome:
Students feel safe and supported at school and have positive relationships with peers and teachers.
Goal: Percentage of positive scores on Educational Effectiveness Survey (EES). - the percentage of 4th-12th students
responding positively on the EES student survey in the area of Collaboration and INterpersonal Skills will improve from 65% to
more than 78%.
Mid-Year Progress:
Students will take the CEE survey later this spring, providing us the opportunity to update the progress towards this goal
at that time.
Professional learning that centers on focal students, a street-level data source, has been utilized in all school sites in
a variety of ways to support a deeper understanding of student strengths and “can dos” for the purpose of
increasing collaboration and interpersonal skills. Examples of this professional learning taking place are our monthly
principal/assistant principal learning sessions, as well as staff meetings and Professional Learning Community
(PLC) meetings self-directed by teacher teams.
Desired Outcome:
Students feel safe and supported at school and have positive relationships with peers and teachers.
Goal: Documented Student Discipline - The number of documented student discipline reports will be reduced in all five schools
by 3% in the 2023-2024 school year. The focus area is the Inappropriate Behavior category. The number of documented
student discipline reports for Inappropriate Behavior will be reduced from 74 in 2022-2023 to 69 in 2023-2024 and at least a
1.0% reduction each following year.
Mid-Year progress:
The number of student discipline reports for the focus area of Inappropriate Behavior (a subset of “Overall
Student Discipline Reports” data displayed to the right) dropped from 45 in the first half of the 2022-2023 school year to

25 in the first half of the 23-24 school year. Our schools are on track to be within our end-of-year goal of a maximum of
60 such reports.
The increases at Thorndyke, Showalter, and Foster are partly due to increased use of the district discipline report form.
Thorndyke shows a small increase, but also had a very small number of reports both last year and this year.
Affecting data at both Foster and Showalter is the increase in total student enrollment compared to last year and
a handful of incidents that involved multiple students.
Next steps:
Schools will engage site staff teams and seek student and parent input as they review individual and school-level data
through an equity lens. The priority is to look for patterns such as disproportionate referrals in race, multilingual
learners, and students with IEPs. Their findings will inform how they adjust their programs for enhancing their positive
school climate for all students.
Desired Outcome:
Students consistently attend their classes and are actively engaged with learning by planning for their futures.
Goal: Percentage of students regularly attending school - The percentage of students regularly attending school will increase
from 63% in 2022=2023 to 73% in 2023-2-24 and will increase by 5% every year after.
Goal: Percentage of 11th-grade students who have completed their High School and Beyond Plan - 90% of 11th-grade students
will complete their High School & Beyond Plan during the 2023-2024 school year. This will increase to 95% during the 20242025 school year and 100% during the 2025-2026 school year.
Mid-Year progress:
Attendance
As of 3/29/2024 (129 school days), the percentage of all TSD students regularly attending school is 85%, averaging all
five (5) schools, as a grand total and disaggregated by race. This exceeds our goal of 73%. "Regularly attending" means
fewer than 18 absences during the school year, no matter how many days the student has been enrolled in the school
year.
High School and Beyond Plan
As of 4/2/24, 42% of 11th graders have completed their High School and Beyond Plan. The end-of-year goal is 90%.
Next Steps:
Attendance
Engage with students who identify as American Indian/Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander to learn their
barriers to more regular attendance, and take steps to minimize or remove those barriers. The other reported racial
groups have very similar rates of regular attendance, ranging from 86%-92%.
High School and Beyond Plan
Foster is working to reach the 90% goal by the end of the 23/24 school year. This involves close communications with
the specific students and parents, as well as teachers and related support professionals including our Stay in School
Coordinator, our Quality Engagement Specialists, and our Community and Family Liaisons. Special focus will be given to
our historically underserved students.
Director Simpson requested that future reports include the data brokedown racially by school, each incident, student, and grade.
Director Proctor shared that we need to ask for this data at the micro level.
President Hoover suggested that the Superintendent share via memo and/or report that contains what is the plan, what is
happening behind the scenes, and data updates on progress/regression. Dr. Pedroza shared that the Team is meeting on April
18th. Dr. Pedroza will submit a plan to the Board by May 1st, with further discussion at the May Work Session. Dr. Pedroza will
also share an elementary and secondary report-out.
Director Larson commented on Slide 11. Doing a race breakdown at the district level is too high to be meaningful. Doing a
breakdown by school and race is much more meaningful because we know attendance at secondary schools is quite different
from attendance at elementary schools. do by school and race. Dr. Pedroza shared that we should look at the SIPs for each
school and look at their goals and strategies.
5. Questions Only
A. Early Warning Indicators, Dual Credits and 2023 World Language Report
Director Larson commented on why are we increasing out-of-school suspension post covid. We tried hard pre-covid to keep kids
in school. Mr. Baker shared that prior to Covid, there was a big emphasis from OSPI on doing different interventions. This was a
requirement from OSPI, to try different things before you excluded a student from school. Perhaps a review of those protocols

and guidelines for school leaders might help. Director Larson shared that this is information that he would like to hear from the
schools about. Dr. Pedroza shared that what we are experiencing, especially when it's a disciplinary, especially of a minor, is that
students are being put on an emergency suspension pending an investigation. There is more work, strategies, and discussions
that are needed.
President Hoover shared that this is an opportunity to strengthen the policy around exclusions. What is the timeline for having
these discussions? They requested the Superintendent to provide a timeline for moving forward with the discussion. In the
gender data presented, there is a significant piece missing. They know that we are limited by state reporting and the questions
that they ask, but we cannot continue to erase trans and non-binary people. When they see a report like this, where the genders
are binary, I would rather it state that we do not have accurate information on our trans and non-binary students, than to give
them one that has the binary only because that is erasure. We cannot erase our trans and non-binary students. Knowing that
we have limitations with what the state provides and/or asks for, what can we in Tukwila do to make steps in a different
direction, or how can we use the information that we do have about students to create accurate data reports so we can have
meaningful conversations about how our students are impacted. They also share that we need to start thinking of
intersectionality with our data. This is a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw and essentially it is a metaphor for helping us
understand the ways that multiple forms of inequity or disadvantage sometimes compound themselves to create obstacles that
often aren't understood. As an example, how many black boys with IEPs are being disciplined disproportionately, what is the rate
of black trans girls who are being suspended or targeted or feel a sense of disconnection, trans and queer and homeless youth.
We need to start thinking about having intersectionality with our data.
Director Proctor shared that our priorities include "all", and this falls into the all. We are trying to serve all students in Tukwila
School District, regardless of what people think regarding race, gender, etc. However we acquire the data, let's put the "all" in
there.
