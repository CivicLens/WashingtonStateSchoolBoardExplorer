OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
March 10, 2021 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Mason called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. She acknowledged that this meeting,
while attended from various locations, is being held on the ancestral homelands of the
Coast Salish people. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz
Hackler, Jenn Mason (President), Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri
O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
Ms. Mason noted that, because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19, public
participation is limited to written submissions only, and all written comments received
will be shared with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all messages
received.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
Dr. Baker shared an update on budget planning for the 2021-22 school year. Now that the
U.S. House of Representatives has passed the economic stimulus plan, the president is
expected to sign it. Most districts in our state have lost funding due to decreased
enrollment and loss of transportation funding. Federal stimulus funds will help districts
stabilize and prevent a number of reductions in force (RIF) notices. There are still many
unknowns about enrollment projections.
Dr. Baker shared photos of facilities that are being renovated and built, including
Alderwood and Parkview elementary schools, Shuksan’s auxiliary gym and Bellingham
High School’s fields. The design for the new district office is being refined, and
community input is being gathered.
Students in grades 4-8 have now begun a hybrid model, and this week we are welcoming
back students in grades 9 and 10. Staff has been excited to see and welcome the students
back.
One week ago, the president mandated that educators be given access to COVID-19
vaccines, and this was validated by Washington’s governor. The district hosted a vaccine
clinic last weekend, vaccinating 500-600 staff members, and on Monday an additional
300 staff members were vaccinated at a clinic at Sehome High School. Dr. Baker shared
photos from the two events. Every district employee, including community partners and
substitutes, has now had the opportunity to receive their first vaccine. Safety precautions

will still be in effect due to students not being vaccinated. Dr. Baker responded to
questions from board members.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
During the reporting period, the district as a whole dealt with multiple, highly impactful
situations, including social justice/police in schools and closures due to the pandemic. Despite
having to move all communications almost solely to online, communication remained
comprehensive, timely, and nimble. The Board is impressed with the work to gather intentional
feedback through Qualtrics, the shift to online graduations, personal replies to emails and
dispersing information that provided district information and superintendent perspective. The
district and superintendent made commendable efforts to communicate with staff and families,
providing leadership, transparency, intention and thoughtfulness during extremely challenging
times.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
Continuing efforts to reach the broadest stakeholder audience possible, including those
traditionally underserved in education settings.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The Board recognizes excellent steps forward in creating new positions around mental health and
EDI work and through hiring of Dr. Janis Velasquez Farmer as Director of Equity, Diversity and
Inclusion, and Dr. Chris Cochran, new Mental Health Coordinator. The Board also appreciates
continued partnerships with WWU in ethnic studies and BSD acting as a community partner with
Lighthouse and the City of Bellingham to provide shelter to vulnerable community members due
to the pandemic. Equity is a major issue in the pandemic and this report highlights the many ways
that the district continued work to identify and interrupt inequities during this time, including
beginning affinity groups for staff members who are people of color, the printing of publications
in more languages and ensuring remote access for all families.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
Continuing to apply an equity lens to the district’s initiatives.
4. Comments on the report itself.
Appreciated all of the examples and links. Interested in seeing more references to the district’s
work around high-impact current events related to race and equity.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• The stakeholder team continues to study the State Standards for Beginning Educator
Induction as well as feedback from new teachers to set goals and focus their work.
• The district and BEA agreed to a three-year contract (2020-2023).
• The district and BAO agreed to a two-year contract (2020-2022).
• This past spring, the district hired our new Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Director.
DB:
• Appreciate the efforts to streamline and reduce paper/storage; and resulting
environmental/financial impacts.
• Remarkable ability to pivot from the many in-person HR activities to remote alternatives,
with little warning or precedence. The same could be said for reorganizing and shifting staff
as the demands created by the pandemic kept shifting and changing.
• Notable continued reduction in staff absences.
• Again, great creativity pivoting from in-person recognitions to virtual or alternative
mechanisms.
• It seems the efforts to provide professional development opportunities continues to grow and
be robust year after year. The focus on remote learning this past year has been excellent.
CDH:
• There were so many changes and updates to policies due to the pandemic. The board
recognizes all of the hard work and planning done by so many. These seem like good

improvements that can continue into the future, such as online training and electronic storage
of documents.
JM:

Managing staffing needs throughout the pandemic as families’ needs and preferences shifted
throughout the pandemic.
Largely avoided substitute shortages that was a major issue across other districts.
The virtual Promise Awards and the recap video that was sent out was a great example of
continuing the importance practice of staff recognition even during this time of crisis.
Shifting the volunteer coordinator to helping meet food and internet needs.
Excellent work to support newer educators.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
DB:
• Question only: The section on Beginning Educator Support refers to “stakeholder goals.”
Who are the stakeholders referred to here?
CDH:
• I have just a question: do employees other than teachers receive training on racism and how to
deal with it (such as school bus drivers)?
JM:
• None, but will be interested to hear more about the work around improving hiring and
retention of under-represented staff that is being led by the EDI Director.

4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Appreciate all the examples showing how our superintendent is in compliance with EL-4.
DB:
• Thorough and comprehensive. Easy to follow.
CDH:
• This is a great report. It must have been challenging due to all of the changes. Thank you.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• BPS noted that in this year-over-year comparison, all four subgroups scored at a slightly
higher percentage on the fall 2020 test.
• Students do not seem to be losing ground because of the pandemic in year-over-year
comparisons in reading. A similar trend was noted in math.
• The district looked for ways to continue to engage students such as Lexia for literacy and
DreamBox for math.
DB:
• It appears, looking at the alternative data presented, that our students are making modest
progress in the targeted areas of math and English, or at least holding their own. And, of
course, due to the suspension of standardized testing, a comparison to similar high-performing
peer districts can’t be made.
• Given the concerns noted last year, it is reassuring to see the long list of activities initiated to
particularly address math scores. We look forward to seeing the outcomes of these efforts in
the future.
JM:
• The MAP data looks promising in terms of showing that significant learning loss didn’t occur
in the early part of the pandemic—and shows that there may have even been gains.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KB:
• The report continues to point out the impact of socioeconomic factors and having an IEP and
ties these to challenges as well as our ELL students needing to have the support so that they
can achieve at high levels.
JM:
• Continued work to close achievement gaps.
• Continued improvement on lagging math scores.

4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• I appreciated examples of how the district had to get creative in how to engage students
around literacy and math.
• The many examples of how teachers are engaging in high quality math instruction.
• This board member believes staff and the superintendent provided examples of how the
district is trying to continue to figure out how to close the gap for all of our groups of learners.
DB:
• Last year it was noted how there has been a solid trend in getting more and more complex
data/analysis for this report. Again, the creativity to look at new and different data to get a
glimpse into student performance when the usual measures were unavailable (due to the
pandemic) is much appreciated.
JM:
• Appreciate the use of different measurements, given that the SBA data isn’t available this
year.
• The information about how the math scores were being addressed was interesting. Appreciate
having this in the report, even though it falls outside of “ends”.

5. Possible changes to the policy.
