uplifting and satisfying event. He enjoyed having the Executive Team present the individual
recognitions to retirees. Dr. Gass joined the other School Board members for a visit to Carl
Cozier Elementary School and appreciated learning why the school earned the 2012 Closing the

including a continued focus on full-time kindergarten, elementary counseling at all schools,
online learning, high school success coordinators, English Language Learners (ELL), and Highly
Capable Learners (HCL) support to all schools. Dr. Baker indicated the district would continue
to use local funds to help offset class size increases due to ongoing state reductions. Dr. Baker
thanked Mr. Cowan, Mr. Greenwood and Ms. Weilage and the entire accounting team for their
work on the budget.
Superintendent Baker announced Brett Greenwood was just named Executive Director of

the district over the last 7 years.
Assistant Superintendent of Business and Operations Ron Cowan, Business Manager Brett
Greenwood and Accounting Supervisor Kathryn Weilage reviewed budget details and responded
to questions from the Board. According to Mr. Cowan, the district is projecting a flat enrollment
with an increase of only 37 students. Revenue is projected to increase approximately $1.1 million
and expenditures will decrease approximately $1.5 million. According to Mr. Cowan,
expenditures are being reduced in nearly every department, primarily in staffing, which keeps the
focus on students. The fund balance at the end of the 2012–13 fiscal year is projected to be
approximately 3.97%, still within the Board-mandated range of 3% to 5% of budgeted general
fund expenditures.
President Bashaw expressed appreciation to Dr. Baker, Mr. Cowan and the accounting staff for
their work on the budget.

POLICY GOVERNANCE MONITORING REPORTS
Monitoring Report for EL-2, Organizational Continuity and Executive Succession
Superintendent Greg Baker presented a monitoring report on EL-2, Organizational Continuity
and Executive Succession. The Board will respond to this Monitoring Report at the June 28,
2012 Board Meeting.
Discussion of EL-9, Facilities Program and EL-10, Asset Protection
The Board discussed EL-9, Facilities Program, and EL-10, Asset Protection. The discussion
centered on combining the two Executive Limitations into one. Director Smith presented a
proposal that combined the two to start the discussion. The Board discussed how broad the
Executive Limitations should be, with the comment that the more broadly written, the more
difficult for staff to present a monitoring report that provides the information the Board needs.
Directors are to review EL-9 and EL-10 prior to the June 28 meeting and send President Bashaw
the list of specific items they wish to include on the revised EL’s, indicating which items should
have detailed reports and which should only be an affirmation of compliance.

BOARD RESPONSE TO MONITORING REPORTS
The Board reviewed the monitoring Report for Ends 3, Life and Learning Skills and Ends 4,
Personal Attributes and Ethics, which the Board heard at the May 24, 2012 School Board
meeting. The Board accepted the monitoring report and concurred that the district is making
reasonable progress toward compliance. The Board felt the report reflected more progress being
made in Ends 4, Personal Attributes and Ethics, than in Ends 3, Life and Learning Skills.
Once adopted, Dr. Stockburger felt The Bellingham Promise would make it easier to measure
future progress. It was also suggested that both Ends 3 and 4 should be reviewed for possible
wording changes at the June 28, 2012 School Board meeting.
There was discussion that data on high school graduates after one, five and ten years following
graduation would be helpful. At the current time, there is no funding for such data.
