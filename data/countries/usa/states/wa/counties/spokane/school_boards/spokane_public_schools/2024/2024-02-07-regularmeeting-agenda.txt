Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order contract to Land O Lakes, Inc., Arden Hills, MN, in the anticipated approximate amount of
$140,000.00 for processing USDA cheese commodities into school meal units per the terms and conditions of Bid No. 7-2324.
Pricing Tabulation:
See attached.
Background:
The goal of this solicitation is to partner with a USDA-approved cheese processor who takes a portion of the districts bulk cheese
allocation and makes it into cheese sticks, slices, shreds and other finished cheese products. There are only two USDAapproved cheese processors for these types of products Bongards Creameries and Land OLakes. The solicitation was sent to
both approved vendors, with both responding. Previous taste tests have concluded that both processors have satisfactory
cheese products suitable for the Nutrition Services program. As such, it is recommended that this bid be awarded to the overall
low respondent, Land O Lakes. This award is for afull product line contract rather than a per line-item basis due to minimum
USDA shipment volumerequirements. Prices are deemed fair and reasonable. Anticipated quantities shown are estimated
amounts based on historic ordering practices; actual ordering totals may differ from the figures referenced in this
recommendation. This award will be for an initial period of one year. Pending satisfactory product quality and service, this bid
may be renewed for up to four annual renewals, or at the discretion of the District, may be re-bid at the end of the current term.
Because of specific ordering uncertainty, it is also recommended that the Board allow for overages in the amount of 10%
($14,000) should it be necessary in the course of the 2024-2025 meal preparations. Expenditures from this purchase will be from
the general fund.

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order contract to FSI Consulting Engineers in an estimated amount of $400,000.00 for American Society
of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineer (ASHRAE) studies of district buildings.
Background:

in the constructed environment. In 2020, this law was amended to include energy use intensity (EUI) targets for various building
types and sizes including school buildings over 50,000 square feet.
The consulting services will provide the district with a list of energy improvement measures, and estimation of their impact and
approximate cost and simple payback calculation per measure, and recommendations regarding their implementation on various
district buildings of concern.
Cost is considered fair and reasonable and will be paid out of the general fund.
