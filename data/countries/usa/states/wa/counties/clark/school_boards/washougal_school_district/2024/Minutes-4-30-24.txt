A. Call to Order, Special Meeting - Pledge of Allegiance
Angela Hancock called the meeting to order at 6:30 p.m. and led the pledge of allegiance.
B. Discuss Superintendent Vacancy & Next Steps
Angela Hancock shared that she had been in conversations with an internal employee, Aaron Hansen, to see his interest in
accepting the role of Interim Superintendent. This is following Superintendent Mary Templeton's announcement that she will be
the new superintendent at Lake Stevens. Angela said that Aaron is well suited to the position, noting his leadership,
experience, communication, relationships, problem solving, and knowledge of requirements, policy, and budget. She said she
received input from district directors, and feels fortunate to have such a qualified option. Angela stated that during the contract
negotiations Aaron agreed to the cuts Mary had previously agreed to, plus some additional cuts.
Jim Cooper thanked Aaron for his willingness to consider the position, and said he is grateful that Aaron considered it. He went
on to say that it is late in the season for a full superintendent search. Jim shared that he is sad to see Mary go, and is looking
forward to working with Aaron.
Chuck Carpenter said he was happy there were good options, and said that a full superintendent search costs between $2530,000, which doesn't make sense right now. Chuck said losing both a superintendent and assistant superintendent at the same
time could cause chaos. He went on to say that next school year the board will do a thorough search process.
Sadie McKenzie said she was grateful that Aaron was identified as an option, said he is very qualified and hopes he accepts.
Ida Royer said it won't be an easy job, but is grateful that Aaron considered it. Ida said that stability is important right now,
and there is not enough time or money to do a full search.
Angela Hancock said she feels this is a natural step and Aaron is ready for it. Angela said she is thankful and Aaron will be
great.
Aaron Hansen said he is thankful, excited, and humbled for the opportunity, and shared that he has always felt supported by
this district and wanted to stay. Aaron thanked Camas School District for realizing the importance of the opportunity, and his
family for their support. He stated he is all in, knows it will be challenging, but has been training for this. He said he loves this
district and staff.
