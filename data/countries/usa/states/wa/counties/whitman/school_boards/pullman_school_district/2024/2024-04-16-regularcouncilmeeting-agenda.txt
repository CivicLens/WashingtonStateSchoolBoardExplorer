strengthened by providing police officers with the resources needed to relieve
community members in distress and by empowering officers to use those resources
with minimal administrative impediments.

Public Content
The Public Works Maintenance and Operations Division team seeks approval to acquire two
new 2025 Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicles (INTERCEPTORS). These vehicles will
replace fleet units 21-019 and 15-024 as part of the 2024-2029 Capital Improvement Program.
The 2024 Equipment Rental Division budget allocates $158,400 for this purpose.
Ford Motor Company recently opened the order window for 2025 INTERCEPTORS. Staff
obtained a quote through a cooperative agreement with Sourcewell contract #091521-NAF and
issued a letter of intent to National Auto Fleet Group, contingent upon Council approval. A quote
from Hells Canyon Upfitting and Sales for upfitting and vehicle preparation that meets Pullman
Police Department standards is included in the pricing (see summary below).
The city previously executed a cooperative purchasing agreement with the National Joint
Powers Alliance (NJPA) in 2018 (Resolution #R-27-18). Later that same year, NJPA launched a
new brand nameand has since done business under the Sourcewell brand. Sourcewell Contract
#091521-NAF adheres to Pullman's competitive bidding and procurement policies.
Beyond the standard police package, these vehicles boast essential safety features that
safeguard our Police Officers. These include an on-demand rear camera, ballistic door panels,
blind-spot monitoring, cross-traffic alert, and perimeter motion alert.

Public Content
Ordinance 10-23 directs that 50% of retail sales tax revenue collected each quarter (less sales
tax derived from construction activities) in excess of $594,135 be placed in the Restricted CIP
Reserve Fund to be used for capital improvement projects.
Ordinance 12-10 further requires the Finance Director to submit a Quarterly Report of the Citys
retail sales tax revenue collections and financial condition. This provides the City Council an
opportunity to revise the percentage placed into the Restricted CIP Revenue Fund.
The 2024Q1 report attached indicates that the transfer amount by ordinance would be $319,396.
For comparison, the 2023Q1 period amount was $332,573. The year-over-year decrease of
$13,177 is the result of decreased overall sales tax revenue.

Public Content
As part of the 2024 Capital Improvement Plan, the fire department received funding to
purchase a new station alerting system for both stations. The current system requires
replacement due to aging equipment, multiple recent failures, and a lack of
redundancy. The Phoenix G2 system will reduce dispatch times, create redundancy,
and automate the current voice dispatching system.
US Digital Designs is a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell, which has a public
solicitation contract with NPP.Gov, of which The City of Pullman is a member.
In accordance with the City of Pullman procurement policies, staff has obtained
quotes for the hardware and is working with Studio+ Architects to create a request for
proposals for the installation of the system.
The 2024 Capital Improvement Program awarded $241,000 for this project. The
equipment cost for both stations and the dispatch center is approximately $182,844,
and the installation cost is approximately $45,711.

At their March 1st, 2022 meeting, Council authorized staff to submit a grant
application to the Washington State Department of Transportation through the City
Safety Program to help reduce fatal and serious injury crashes. The grant application
included two projects, both of which were selected for award late in the fall of 2022.
One of the two projects is titled the Citywide Intersection Improvement Project.
This project includes the following scope of improvements at nine signalized
intersections as derived from the Citys 2022 Local Road Safety Plan:
Implement flashing left yellow arrows
Advance pedestrian/bicycle crossing interval
New 12-inch signal heads with reflectorized backplates
Internally illuminated street name signs
New traffic signal controllers and cabinets to support programming and operational
modifications
The nine signal locations are listed below:
S. Grand Ave / Bishop Blvd
S. Grand Ave / Crestview St
N. Grand Ave / Whitman St
N. Grand Ave / Stadium Way
N. Grand Ave / Terre View Dr
NE Stadium Way / NE Valley Rd
E. Main St / NE Stadium Way
E. Main St / SW Bishop Blvd
E. Main St / NE Terre View Dr
The estimated project cost for final design work and construction is $1,062,000, which
is 100% funded with federal funds through the City Safety Program. In order to
authorize this project with WSDOT and obligate funding for engineering work
(including design and bid document preparation), a Project Prospectus and a Local
Agency Agreement have been prepared for Council Action. Once WSDOT obligates
funds, then the City can begin incurring costs for the project that will be eligible for
reimbursement. Design work is planned for 2024 and construction work is planned for
2025.

Public Content
Pullman City Code (PCC) Chapter 10B, Water Conservation, was adopted in March
2023 (seethis link to view the relevant City Council agenda item). This chapter
establishes guidelines for Pullman water customers in when and how they may apply
water to irrigated spaces, in an effort to encourage responsible outdoor water usage
and conservation. Based on feedback received from staff and the community
following the first year of implementation of the therein-defined Outdoor Irrigation
Season and Schedule, minor amendments are proposed to Section 10B.05.010 and
10B.05.025 per the attached drafted ordinance. A second attachment is provided
showing the proposed additions and deletions within all of Chapter 10B.
Proposed Amendment #1:
The proposed amendments to Section 10B.05.010 aim to simplify the defined
watering schedule by modifying the definition of the Watering Window. Currently, the
Watering Window begins at 6:00 p.m. on the designated day and ends at 10:00 a.m.
the following day. Feedback received showed that this was confusing for customers
to understand and implement.
Staff recommends that the definition ofWatering Windowbe modified toallow watering
any time before 10:00 a.m. and after 6:00 p.m. on the same day.
This change avoids the overnight split of the Watering Window, providing the same
initial intent to restrict watering during the hottest times of the day, but in a manner
that is easier to understand and administer.
The remaining key components of the Outdoor Irrigation Season and Schedule would
remain the same and are as follows:
Outdoor Irrigation Season June 1 to September 30 each year, unless declared
otherwise
Outdoor Irrigation Schedule, Frequency three (3) days per week maximum,
based on even and odd address numbering
Even Addresses Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday
Odd Addresses Wednesday, Friday, Sunday
Proposed Amendment #2:
The second proposed amendment is within Section 10B.05.025. Currently, schools
and city-owned parks may water any given area for up to three days in any calendar
week.The proposed amendment will allow these same sites to water any given area
for up to four days in any calendar week. The Parks Department, in particular,
struggled with keeping the common grassy areas in a quality condition necessary to
specifically support recreational activities. This modification is anticipated to resolve
this particular concern while still promoting efficient outdoor water use.

Recommended Action :

By motion, adopt the attached resolution awarding
contract 23-02, Terre View & Crestview Paths, to MotleyMotley, Inc. for the bid amount of $1,217,199.00.

Public Content
The scope of contract 23-02, Terre View & Crestview Paths, consists of constructing
the following:
Terre View Path (Schedule A) 1,200 linear feet of 12-foot-wide hot mix asphalt
(HMA) path along the south/eastbound side of NE Terre View Drive from NE
Merman Drive to NE North Fairway Road.

Crestview Path (Schedule B) 890 linear feet of 12-foot-wide HMA path along
the south/eastbound side of SE Crestview Street from S Grand Avenue to SE
Thompson Street.
Refer to the attached exhibits for a depiction of the two project locations. Associated
project work includes constructing 2,095 linear feet of curb and gutter, 305 square
yards of sidewalk, 2,420 square feet of modular block retaining wall, 935 linear feet of
pedestrian railing, and two (2) rectangular rapid flashing beacon (RRFB) solar
pedestrian crossing systems (one at the east end of Crestview Path, and the other on
NE Terre View Drive near Cougars Closet). Other miscellaneous related work
includes minor storm sewer modifications, existing fire hydrant relocation, utility cover
adjustments, relocation and installation of permanent signage, and pavement striping.
Bids for this project were opened on March 26, 2024, and two proposals were
received. Motley-Motley, Inc.'s low bid is $1,217,199.00, which is $300,004.00
(32.7%) higher than the Engineers Estimate of $917,195.00. The second bid is 31.1%
higher than the low bid, at $1,595,899.00. A copy of the bid summary is attached for
reference.
The difference between the Engineers Estimate and the low bid is primarily
attributable to the underestimation of mobilization, landscape and restoration, and
pedestrian railing costs. For the bid items that are applicable to these three
categories, the total price difference is $208,762.00, with over two-thirds of this
amount attributable solely to Bid Item 26, Pedestrian Railing. Staff estimated this
particular bid item utilizing contract unit prices from past comparable projects. The
most recent was a 2020 project at $50.00 per linear foot, and before that, a 2018
project at $71.53 per linear foot. Staff attempted to account for inflation and market
changes since that time, increasing and adjusting the estimated unit price to $100.00
per linear foot on this project, but this was not enough. The low bidder assigned
$250.00 per linear foot to this item of work, with the second bid at $140.00 per linear
foot. Considering the significant amount of pedestrian railing specified on this project
(935 linear feet), this realized price difference of $150.00 per linear foot is substantial
($140,250.00 in total). Despite the described underestimation of certain project
elements, a comparison of the two bids to each other provides a good indicator that
the low bidders prices overall are fair and represent the work involved and that the
Engineers Estimate was just off.
A Complete Streets grant from the Transportation Improvement Board (TIB) is in
place for this project, contributing a set $750,000.00, with the City responsible to
cover any remaining project costs above this. For the total low bid price, the local
match amount equates to $467,199.00, which is more than double the $200,000.00
budgeted for in the Arterial Streets Fund. Recognizing this budget deficit, staff has
identified significant potential project savings if a design change is made to utilize a
black vinyl chain link fence in lieu of pedestrian railing. Assuming an applicable unit

price for the fence of $70 per linear foot for the 935 linear feet needed, this results in
an estimated total savings of $168,300.00 if this design change is made. With this,
the local match amount projected would drop to a manageable $300,000.00.
City Staff has reached out to the Parks Department in regards to this potential design
change, as their input was the primary driver during the design for selecting
pedestrian railing over the fence. Either feature provides the fall protection measures
required for safety purposes, with the pedestrian railing preferred over the fence,
considering its typically more accommodating to snow removal activities. Parks
confirmed that the fence is an acceptable alternative for this project, given the
substantial realized price for pedestrian railing.
Rejecting the bid and re-bidding the project, with or without the discussed design
change, is not recommended. First, it is not expected to result in a lower price.
Second, doing so would likely delay the project to next year, which would result in a
loss of the TIB Complete Streets funds ($750,000.00), which, by agreement, must be
expended by March 25, 2025. For these reasons, staff recommends awarding this
project to Motley-Motley, Inc. at the bid price of $1,217,199.00. Following contract
execution, staff would work with the Contractor to officially make a design change
from pedestrian railing to fence via a change order. The exact price savings in said
change order may vary somewhat from what is presented above, but staff is confident
it would be in that general ballpark.
If approved for award, onsite work is expected to commence as early as mid-May and
be physically complete by the end of October. For the construction of Crestview Path
in particular, a roadway closure is anticipated on SE Crestview Street from S Grand
Avenue to SE Thompson Street, with access to City Hall and SE Thompson Street off
westbound Crestview to be maintained throughout. As such, construction at this
location is restricted to the summer months (mid-June to late August), when the
Pullman School District is not in session. Because construction of Terre View Path
can typically be completed with two-way traffic maintained, the allowed window of
construction at that location is not restricted at all within the overall contract
timeframe.
Also, upon award approval, staff will work to prepare a resolution for a subsequent
City Council meeting that would permanently restrict all on-street parking on SE
Crestview Street directly adjacent to the middle portion of the new path. This is
necessary because the Crestview Path construction will narrow the roadway width
from 36 feet to 27 feet for approximately 620 linear feet of the directly adjacent
roadway. While on-street parking is presently allowed in this stretch of roadway on
both sides, observation of vehicles actually parking here has been non-existent (i.e.,
its not being utilized). The roadway width will remain the same at both ends of the
new path, maintaining existing critical turn lanes at S. Grand and also at the City Hall
Entrance.

Adopt the attached resolution authorizing the execution of
a Grant Agreement with the Washington State
Transportation Improvement Board for the Downtown
Improvements project.

Public Content
In early February, the Washington State Transportation Improvement Board (TIB)
announced a unique Early Opportunity Application for Complete Street funding
available only for projects that would be constructed this year (2024). The opportunity
was only open to cities that currently have a Complete Streets Ordinance, which

includes Pullman. The TIB indicated that this early opportunity application would likely
be a one-time situation due to an influx of Complete Streets funding in the next
several years.
Upon learning this, staff recognized that the downtown project would be eligible to
apply for this unique and well-timed funding opportunity. Parts of the Downtown
Improvements Project align very well with Complete Streets criteria, and it was a
project at the ready that met the requirement of needing to be completed this year.
There was a short turnaround to meet TIBs March 1st application deadline, so staff
immediately began work on preparing an application. Staff submitted the application
at the end of February, knowing that if we were awarded the grant, we would then
bring it before the council for approval of the grant agreement.
On March 22nd, the city was notified that the Transportation Improvement Board
approved and awarded $1,000,000 in Complete Streets funding for the Pullman
Downtown Improvements project. This funding amount is based on the TIB staffs
review of the projects details and their selection of which project bid items were
eligible for Complete Streets funding. These items include sidewalk, curb ramps,
pavers, the bike lane, and bid additives 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. The total bid cost for these
items is $1,177,874.50. TIB funds will cover 84.8987% of these specific project costs,
up to the amount of $1,000,000.
The Bid Additives 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 were not originally awarded to the Contractor.
Thus, pending approval of this TIB Grant Agreement, a project change order has
been prepared to add these items back into the contract. This change order will be
presented in the agenda items immediately following this one. As a reminder, these
bid additives include benches, trash receptacles, bike racks, planter boxes, and
wayfinding throughout the project limits.
The agreement setting forth the contractual conditions between the City of Pullman
and TIB for this project is a Fuel Tax Grant Agreement.

Improvements.

Public Content
The scope of contract 23-10, Pullman Downtown Improvements, consists of the
improvement of East Main Street between N. Grand Avenue and SE Spring Street,
including water/sewer/storm mains, full road and sidewalk construction, traffic and
pedestrian signal construction, landscaping, and street furniture. At their February 6th
meeting, the City Council awarded the contract to Apollo, Inc. Said contract award
included the base bid plus bid additive work at Pine Street Plaza. The following bid
additives were not awarded:
Benches
Trash Receptacles
Bike Racks
Planter Boxes
Wayfinding
Since the said award, the City has received a complete street grant from the
Washington State Transportation Improvement Board (TIB) to help fund the awarded
project plus the bid additive work that was not awarded on February 6th. This change
order adds the above-mentioned bid additives back into the contract at the bid prices.
This change order increases the contract amount by $246,260. A copy of Change
Order No. 1 and a summary of its items of work are attached to this staff report. The
Public Works Director has approved and signed Change Order No. 1 as authorized
per Pullman City Code Section 1.107.140.

Staff are now seeking ratification by the City Council of said change order.
Ratification of this Change Order is dependent on City Council execution of the abovereferenced TIB grant, which is also being presented to City Council under a separate
item at tonights Council meeting.
