psychologists to attend the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) convention in Chicago,
Illinois. The NASP Convention was held on March 2 5, 2010. Travel reimbursements will be paid with

Thank you for your consideration of this request.
---------------------------------------------------------TO: Karst Brandsma, Acting Deputy Superintendent
FROM: Sue Thomas, Special Education Director
RE: Travel Request Special Education Staff
The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) convention was held on March 25, 2010.
Location of the convention was Chicago, Illinois. The sessions devoted to the topic of Response to
Intervention (RtI) are particularly relevant to implementation of an RtI model in our district.
I approved one of the request for leave to attend the convention back in mid-January. Because his
request came so early, I chose to wait until February to submit for Board approval. I admit to totally
forgetting about the request (and without a substitute secretary who knows the protocol for out-of- state
travel to remind me). It was not until he submitted his receipts did I realize my mistake.
As for the other request for leave, I did not receive the form for my signature until after she had already
left for Chicago. While I remember talking about both the NASP and WASP (Washington) conventions at
her goal-planning meeting in October, I do not recall if this staff person had approached me, either
verbally or in writing, to approve her attendance at the selected convention.
I apologize for these errors. I am fully aware of the necessity of seeking Board approval for out-of-state
travel.
Registration and travel expenses are to be reimbursed with their Individual Staff Development funds
allotment. Any expenses over the allotment are personal pay.

Explanation of Issue: District Progress for Application of State Waiver Days
Background
At the February 25, 2010 Board Meeting, the Board authorized the superintendent to move forward with a
process to apply to the State Board of Education for the use of state waiver days for staff development,
while reducing the total number of early release days. The District used ten early release days for staff
development purposes during the 200910 school year.
Status/Update

The superintendent asked me to convene the District Use of Time Task Force (comprised of parents,
teachers, administrators, and central services administrators) to further this proposal and to respond to
the use of state waiver days while reducing the number of early release days. I will be present at the
March 25 Board Meeting to provide an update on the feedback received from the Use of Time Task
Force and share the State Board of Educations application process. It is anticipated that administration
could recommend a resolution at the April 25 regularly scheduled Board Meeting. This resolution is part
of the State Board of Education application process.
