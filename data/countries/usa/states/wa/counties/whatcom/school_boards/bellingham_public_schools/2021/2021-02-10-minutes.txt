OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
February 10, 2021 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Mason called the meeting to order at 6:01p.m. She acknowledged that this meeting,
while attended from various locations, is being held on the ancestral homelands of the
Coast Salish people. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz
Hackler, Jenn Mason (President), Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri
O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
Ms. Mason noted that, because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19, public
participation is limited to written submissions only, and all written comments received
will be shared with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all messages
received.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
Dr. Baker asked Director of Teaching and Learning Amy Carder to give an update on the
Connections program, which has been supporting students by providing them with an
outdoor-based learning program during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vamos Outdoors and
Wild Whatcom have partnered with the district in this work, and Amy introduced Andy
Basabe of Vamos Outdoors and Licia Sahagun of Wild Whatcom. Amy, Andy and Licia
each shared information about Connections and the positive impact the program has had
on students. They then responded to questions from the board.
Promise Kindergarten started Jan. 25, 2021 at Alderwood, Birchwood, Cordata, Geneva,
Happy Valley, Northern Heights and Roosevelt elementary schools. Assistant
Superintendent of Teaching and Learning Kristi Dominguez shared that this is the
district’s eighth Promise K cohort. With 118 enrolled students, it is the largest cohort thus
far. Family engagement is a high priority in the program, and this year Zoom calls were
held with families so they could help design and learn protocols. A remote option for is
also being provided at each school site, with the teacher meeting weekly with families.
Kristi responded to questions from the board.
Director of Capital Projects Curtis Lawyer gave an update on several capital projects,
sharing photos and design timelines for Alderwood, Parkview and Sunnyland elementary
schools; Bellingham High School fields (phase 2); Shuksan Middle School gym and the
District Office. Alderwood and Parkview are scheduled to open fall 2021, and Sunnyland
is expected to be complete by fall 2022. Each of the three elementary schools and the

•

•

district office will be approximately 50,000 square feet, at a cost of approximately $30
million each. Curtis and Dr. Baker answered questions from board members.
Dr. Baker gave a reopening update. Since the last board meeting, Promise K and grade 2
have begun in-person learning. Last Friday the expected return dates for grades 3-8 were
announced, and Dr. Baker received a lot of feedback after that announcement, with many
advocating for dates and details about grades 9-12. The district continues to work with
labor partners on what the rollout will look like. COVID-19 cases have been on a slow
decline over the past few weeks, and the area within our district’s boundaries continues to
remain under 200 cases per 100K. Dr. Baker responded to questions from board
members.
Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources Bob Kuehl, who oversees high school
athletics and activities, gave an overview of the activities and athletics recent start up and
shared that in the first season of the school year, over 800 students are participating in
activities.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• Having to move all operations online. Dr. Baker and his staff have had to pivot this past year
and communicate out to staff and families. I am thinking some of the biggest lifts have been
food distribution as well as technology. Graduations were online for the first time for all four
of our high schools. BPS is in the process of building three new elementary schools, turf
fields and planning for a new district office. The community supported our technology and
operations levy last February by 71% pass rate.
DB:
• Like other forms of communication, the work done here by the superintendent and his team is
exemplary. It is comprehensive, timely and nimble— as evidenced by curve balls like the
pandemic, social unrest and staff tragedies. Yet, the communication with the public and
outside stakeholders remains comprehensive and sharp. The superintendent spends countless
hours ensuring that public, staff and students are heard and get a personal reply. The work
done by the district in this area could easily be a model of how it can and should be done.
(This board member rated the report as showing “in compliance” only because “exceeds
compliance” was not an option.)
JM:
• Impressive work to entirely retool communications in response to the pandemic, including
through Qualtrics, website redesign and virtual ground-breaking/budget

presentations/graduations. Continuing to effectively engage families even while in-person
contact is extremely limited is a testament to the District’s strength in this area.
During the reporting period, the district as a whole dealt with multiple, highly impactful
situations, including social justice/police in schools and closures due to the pandemic. The
district and superintendent communicated expertly through these situations, providing
leadership, transparency, intention and thoughtfulness during extremely challenging times.
The hashtag campaigns added a lovely human element to communications at a time when
people were very disconnected from each other. The use of storytelling across platforms and
showcasing the efforts of our staff/community brought a much-appreciated level of depth to
communication.
Commendable efforts in dispersing information and superintendent perspective over many
nuanced and deeply felt topics over the last year.
Use of Qualtrics is a great step in intentionally gathering feedback and reviewing at a systems
level—hope to see this expanded in the future.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KR:
• The report lists many examples of one-way communication to the community and
stakeholders. While these efforts are commendable, best practices in communication dictate
the need to establish a “two-way street” and the few examples of stakeholder participation
given (e.g. community meetings held during working hours, specialized committees for
student and parent participation) seem, at face value, to ignore issues of equity and access.
While not included in the report, there are also troubling challenges in timing and opacity
(including messages in regards to school opening dates, and communications around district
resource officers).
• Additionally, despite family engagement being one of the most critical aspects of student
success social media communications in particular focus heavily on district/school
perspective and rarely include a student or family perspective. In addition to the lack of
inclusion of stakeholders vital to student success, the sole focus on district employees on
social media also erases the community role in schools—in addition to the engagement
priorities included in EL-10, the district is also public asset. Yet the community is rarely
reflected in the communications most likely to reach them. Communication is only effective if
it reaches the target audience, and the report fails to include evidence of this occurring for
many stakeholders of the BSD community. Which is not to say current communication
strategies are not effective, just that the report doesn’t include evidence that it is. Information
like demographic data in website traffic or social media audience would be helpful in
identifying potential gaps in which audiences are or are not consistently accessing or being
exposed to these communications.
• Finally, EL-3 while the report answers ”affirmative” that there is “a process in place to
address student, parent, and stakeholder concerns in a timely manner”. It includes as evidence
the decrease in complaints reaching the school board (although there is no data that indicates
this) and cites team members as responding to parents and others with concerns as a
“proactive” approach. It’s confusing how responding to concerns is considered proactive.
Additionally, while a decrease in complaints reaching the board *may* indicate a decrease in
2

ATTACHMENT C

concerns, it is not by itself evidence of that. There are many reasons individuals may not be
using the listening post, including anecdotal statements assuming concerns sent to the
Superintendent are always shared with the board (which, it would seem, they are not).

4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Very lengthy and detailed report that supports the superintendent is in compliance. Appreciate
the use of examples from past publications.
DB:
• Very thorough. Overwhelming with evidence of outstanding work.
JM:
• Thank you for all the visuals and examples! It’s fun to see elements of this report in action.
KR:
• Given the mandate is around taking actions that are reasonable and prudent typical for similar
and highly effective organizations, it would be helpful to include what some of those actions
may be (this information has been included in other EL’s if I recall correctly). Otherwise,
evaluation is mostly likely based on board member experience and individual perception—it’s
easy to assume if a communication is effective for oneself it’s easy to assume it’s effective for
everyone.

5. Possible changes to the policy.
JM:
• Minor change to consider, adding the word “accessible” to the policy?
o The superintendent shall not fail to ensure that non-employee stakeholders are treated
with respect and dignity throughout the organization and are provided with accessible
communications regarding district events, plans and actions.
KR:
• Is the current policy clear enough on the goal of communications? Is the goal to have
effective communications that result in stakeholder engagement and understanding to disperse
information?

The addition of the Director for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and subsequent hiring of Dr.
Janis Velasquez Farmer demonstrates commitment to addressing inequities at the institutional
level. This is a wonderful addition to the team.
The Board has had many discussions about student mental health; the addition of the Mental
Health Coordinator is a major step for addressing student need in this area.
Adding to the Family Engagement Team so that each school has a point person is so
important for our historically less connected families, particularly during the pandemic.
Wonderful work by this team to make personalized efforts to connect and meet the specific
needs of our families.
The addition of the Ethnic Studies course across high schools
Equity is a major issue in the pandemic and this report highlights the many ways that the
district continued work to identify and interrupt inequities during this time.
Excellent steps forward in creating new positions around mental health and DEI work and
through hiring of Dr. Janis Velasquez Farmer as Director of Equity, Diversity and Dr. Chris
Cochran, new Mental Health Coordinator.
Appreciate continued partnerships with WWU in ethnic studies and BSD acting as a
community partner with Lighthouse and the City to provide shelter to vulnerable community
members due to the pandemic.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KB:
• Continuing to apply an equity lens to the district’s initiatives.
KR:
• Despite the report covering a time period that includes the largest civil rights and racial justice
protests in a generation, during which the board and district received considerable feedback
on BSD policies around police in schools, this is relegated to one bullet point about learning
about student perspectives of color. Not addressed at all beyond student conversations, despite
one area of focus being to engage families and community partners in culturally appropriate
ways to ensure cultural perspectives are elevated and valued.
• Mental health coordinator is a great first step, however despite being listed as a reason for reopening, many families describe feeling unsupported during the pandemic and other crises.

4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• I appreciate the links provided in the report.
DB:
• The point-by-point approach with interpretation and evidence sections made for a very clear
and focused report.

Appreciated all of the examples. This report demonstrates the importance of EL-10’s recent
addition as it effectively monitors issues around race and equity.

5. Possible changes to the policy.
DB:
• Since this is a relatively new EL policy, the Board would appreciate hearing any
superintendent/staff recommendations for additions or revisions.
