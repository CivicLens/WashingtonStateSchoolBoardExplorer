Heights Elementary School, conducted by SpeeWest.

Public Content
Information:
Approval of Constructability Review Report dated May 6, 2024, as a requirement of receiving State
Construction Assistance Funding.
Background:
Constructability Review is one of the techniques the District uses to improve quality, control costs and
add value to construction projects. OSPI requires a Constructability Review on all state construction
assistance projects of 50,000 square feet or greater (WAC 392-343-080). The WAC requires a minimum
forty-hour workshop by five or more team members. The cited WAC defines constructability as "a cost
control technique" based on a review of project documents by mechanical, electrical, structural,
construction, and design professionals before requesting bids. A constructability review is to identify
potential claim or problem areas and deficiencies that may result from errors, ambiguities, omissions,
discrepancies, and conflicts in design documents. The review intends to foresee potential risks related to
contract document irregularities, conflicts, omissions, and schedule and coordination issues to control
costs and avoid delays.
The team was led by our General Contractor/Construction Manager (GC/CM), SpeeWest who continued
to provide constructability comments to the Design team as the design for Oak Heights evolved. The
architect and their consultants have continued to discuss constructability issues with the GC/CM, have
kept an ongoing dialogue, and incorporated agreed-upon changes into the design as it progressed.

Throughout the project, there have been over 688 comments. The comments are organized by drawing
number and specification section. The design team has resolved and responded to each item.
Due to the file size of the full Constructability Review Report, it is only available for review at the Capital
Projects Office by contacting Sharon James or Aaron Pflaumer at 425-431-7166.
