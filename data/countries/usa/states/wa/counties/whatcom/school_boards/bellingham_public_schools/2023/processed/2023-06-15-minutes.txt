OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
June 15, 2023 – Options High School, 2015 Franklin St., Bellingham, WA.
Call to Order/Land Acknowledgment:
Ms. Diaz Hackler (President) called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. She acknowledged
that this meeting is being held on the ancestral homelands of the Coast Salish people.
Roll Call:
Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler (President),
Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder). Director Katie Rose attended the
meeting via Zoom and Ms. Mason was unable to attend the meeting.
Audience:
• Tim Massey is a paraeducator, a Bellingham native and a product of the Bellingham
Public Schools, who in the past worked for a non-profit to implement educational
programs with Bellingham Public Schools. He is concerned that the district’s budget
cuts primarily affect employees who earn the least, and the cost-of-living adjustments
perpetuate wealth inequity. The cost-of-living adjustment for an administrator with an
annual salary of $150,000 will be approximately five times more than our lowest paid
employees. Entry level positions are prohibitive to anyone who does not have a
partner with a second income or who lives with family. These are life circumstances
that are affecting minorities. He is not asking for a politically attractive statement to
the public. You are better than this, and this district taught me better.
• Tania Quijada Flores is the president of the Bellingham Association of School
Employees (BASE) and a paraeducator at Carl Cozier Elementary School. She
appreciates the effort to reemploy those whose positions had been previously
eliminated, but she is not sure that she will be able to return for the 2023-24 school
year. She serves on a team that provides complex services to students, and next year it
will be a new team with less experience as four of the 14 paraeducators will not be
returning. Approximately 100 employees were impacted by at least 45-minute cuts.
Taking 45 minutes per day from those who are struggling to keep up with the cost of
living forces those employees to make a choice between keeping this job or leaving
for other opportunities.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Budget update: The longstanding Mountain School field trip for fifth graders was
reinstated. Each day there are changes with retirements and resignations, and the team
is working with Human Resources to interpret budget information coming from the

•

•

state. Some who one month ago thought they wouldn’t have positions will now be
keeping those positions. There will be more adjustments over the summer as the
district continues to bargain with one of the labor groups. Enrollment will be a strong
factor in formulating the budget. Dr. Baker was in a meeting yesterday with OSPI and
other superintendents to begin budget planning for the 2024-25 school year. A new
governor will be elected in November, and that governor’s priorities will impact
future budgets. Education was not one of the top areas of focus for the legislature in
the last session.
Tomorrow is the last day of school, and it has been a busy last couple of weeks. Some
highlights include:
o Thanks to the Bellingham Public Schools Foundation, we were able to honor
several retiring staff who have dedicated their lives to education.
o The annual fifth grade track meet took place at Civic Field, with students from
all 14 elementary schools participating.
o The Whatcom Youth Pride Parade enjoyed good weather and was attended by
many kids and families.
o The Brother Ray’s Sixth Grade Band Benefit was held on June 3, sponsored
by the Bellingham Public Schools Foundation.
o Community Transitions held its graduation at Depot Market Square on June 8,
followed by all four high schools’ graduation ceremonies at Civic Field on
June 10. There was a little rain at the beginning of the day, but the graduations
were a great success. It was a one schoolhouse collaboration that required
many staff hours prior to and on the day of the events.
o Fifth and eighth grade step-up celebrations are taking place this week as
students prepare to transition to middle school and high school.
The roof of the new district office is being completed. Students in a high school
construction design class visited the site recently and learned from workers on the
site, received a tour and were able to ask questions.
The new location for the Community Transitions program, at the former WECU
Birchwood branch, will be ready for students in the fall. WECU will continue to
operate a drive through ATM. The program will remain in that space until another
site is identified.

Dr. Baker responded to questions from the board.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
Annual Affirmative Action Progress Report – no action needed.
GP-7.2 – 2022-23 Annual Board Agenda, Revised – general review.
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Mr. Benjamin very much enjoyed the board’s recent dinner meeting. Although it
qualified as a meeting by Open Public Meeting Act rules, no district business was
discussed. The student roundtable at Sunnyland was great, as was the retirement
dinner which recognized many amazing educators. At the Roosevelt school visit, it
was very evident that The Bellingham Promise is imbedded into the school’s culture.
He attended the Bellingham High School graduation and was privileged to shake his
daughter’s hand as she graduated. While attending graduation parties over the
weekend he heard many compliments about the graduation events. The Brother Ray’s
Benefit was a great event highlighting student music groups and ending with a
performance by The Atlantics, featuring our own Deputy Superintendent Mike
Copland.

Ms. Rose echoed Mr. Benjamin’s remarks. Although she began serving on the school
board in 2020, this year was her first opportunity to attend the retirement dinner and
graduation, due to COVID restrictions and her own illness. It was great to be a part of
those celebrations. The Roosevelt school visit and Sunnyland student roundtable were
fun and informative. There were moments where she heard the Roosevelt teachers
and administrators talking, and it emphasized how deeply understood the students are.
She also witnessed some fantastic community arts and music over the past few weeks.
While attending the Ski to Sea parade, she found herself thinking about how
impactful those traditions are in our communities. She attended with her father, who
is a Bellingham High School alumnus. She enjoyed hearing him reflect on his
experiences at parades and concerts while he was a student and member of the BHS
band.
Ms. Bashaw noted that the Roosevelt school visit was different than other visits, with
board members going into classrooms to see the students. She believes the strong
culture at Roosevelt will continue after students move into the future new building for
Roosevelt. She attended her last retirement dinner, which was very meaningful, as
well as her last graduation ceremony for Options High School. The graduation
featured many student speakers with heartfelt stories. Many of the students mentioned
Dayle Hudson, the school custodian, and how important she has been to them while at
Options.
Ms. Diaz Hackler always appreciates the school board dinners. A highlight of the
student roundtable at Sunnyland was the student who gave an additional summary of
his table group’s discussions. She noted that a retiree at the retirement dinner had
started while Ms. Diaz Hackler was a high school student. She also believes the
strong culture at Roosevelt will survive when the new school is built. Graduation is
one of her favorite events to attend, and while the students will never remember we
were there, we will remember.
