Information, Discussion, First Reading

Public Content
Assistant Superintendent Dwight Lundstrom will present updates to the following board policies as a first reading. Marked-up
versions of these policies and procedures are attached, along with the July, November and December 2023 editions of WSSDA
Policy and Legal News.
1310 Policy Adoption, Manuals, and Administrative Procedures
2004 Performance Improvement Goals
2090/2090P Program Evaluation

2190P Highly Capable Services
2410/2410P High School Graduation Requirements
2413 Equivalency Credit for Career and Technical Education Courses
5005 Employment and Volunteers
5271/5271P Reporting Improper Governmental Action
5280 Separation from Employment
6215 Claim Certification and Approval
6217/6217P Electronic Funds Transfer (New)
Note on Procedure 2410P
Board Procedure 2410P was last updated in November with the addition of Performance-Based Learning Experience. This
current update changes the legal reference for policy 2410 and adds the requirement for examining data on student groups
participating in and completing each graduation pathway. This requirement is specifically outlined in RCW 28A.655.650 (3)(a)
Additionally, upon further research, we would like to remove the recently added Performance-Based Learning Experience
pathway option. We have received broad guidance from the State Board of Education to implement this new pathway and it is
currently under the school districts discretion to implement this change. The law states the following: RCW 28A.655.250 (4)
While the legislature encourages school districts to make all pathway options established in this section available to their high
school students, and to expand their pathway options until that goal is met, school districts have discretion in determining which
pathway options under this section they will offer to students. The performance-based learning experience pathway is an option
that was created for districts that are unable to robustly offer the number of programs we are able to offer through our Career
and Technical Education (CTE) Program.
Removing the performance-based pathway will allow the High School staff to focus, expand, or improve on the current CTE
pathways we offer students. Removal of this additional pathway recognizes the added burden it would place on the staff to
monitor, ensure alignment of the pathway with students High School and Beyond Plan goals, advise students through the
process, and evaluate the students product based on proficiency of ELA or math standards identified in the initial student
proposal with little to no guidance or resources from the state. It would also remove the possibility of further financial burdens to
the district based on the staff requirements to have oversight, monitor, and provide final evaluation of student proposals. Not
having a performance-based pathway will also preclude OHSD from needing to adopt Policy 2415 and 2415P as included in the
December 2023 Policy and Legal News Updates.
