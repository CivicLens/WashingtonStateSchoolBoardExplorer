The week before school, 50 leadership students gathered at LMS for an all-day leadership retreat. They
talked about their theme "We Are LMS" and how they can work together to get all students connected to
school. The discussed what makes a community and how important it is to make sure all belong and
brainstormed different activities to do through-out the year. Many shared their own experiences and at the
