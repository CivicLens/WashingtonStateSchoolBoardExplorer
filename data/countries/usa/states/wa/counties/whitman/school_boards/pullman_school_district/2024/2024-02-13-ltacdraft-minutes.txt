2. January Tourism Report

Information
Alexis Foran updated the Commission on January tourism report and what Pullman Chamber of Commerce (PCC) is
doing as they move forward. The PCC is working on their Strategic Plan—they are working on launching the new
CMS—Simple View, working on updating “Palouse Scenic Byway”. They are hoping to include surrounding
communities on “Palouse Scenic Byway” marketing Pullman as a “HUB” to visit the peripheral communities and sites.
She also updated the commission on some of the new apps and mapping technologies they are exploring and hoping
to implement.
Pat Wright brought into the discussion the idea of using QR Codes for events to show all related events/schedule. This
is also something PCC is looking in to for Lentil Fest.
The commission then discussed ways that LTAC and Pullman Chamber of Commerce could help support downtown
businesses and tourism during the Downtown Pullman Project. The commission talked about whether there’s a way for
LTAC to work as a facilitator for helping as different ideas and options for support are moved in to action.
Commission member, Tim Cordodor, also put forth the idea of how he had seen an example of in one city they had a
“mirror” website to their tourism site. This allowed locals to see a city calendar of events, micro-events, and highlight
local businesses.

3. Cougs First! QB Classic

Action, Minutes, Motions
Tony Poston, executive director, of Cougs First! was present and elaborated how this tournament helped to
support local businesses and the draw for Cougar fans with bringing back past star Quarterbacks. He
explained how each “hole” of the golf tournament features a local business. The purpose of this tournament is
to both provide scholarships and help with the operations of their non-profit—Cougs First! The commission
commented on how well run this tournament is—it is well funded by sponsorships. Tony Poston did comment
on how he would need to cut back on Marketing if LTAC funds request was not approved. The commission
also discussed how do we draw whole families to come to tournaments such as this—to improve appeal for a
greater audience and not just the participating athlete to come and induce them to stay longer. Tony Poston
spoke on how this is partnered with the Spring Game as a draw to families. Also, several of the events
associated with the golf tournament are at capacity. The commission then discussed what criteria is used for
evaluating grant requests--the commission evaluates fund requests based on whether the event will support
tourism for Pullman.
PJ Sanchez made a motion to approve funds to support Cougs First! QB Classic Golf tournament for the full
amount of the grant request of $15,000.00.
