Motion for the Approval for 6th-8th graders participate in
the high school golf program practices

Public Content
I would like the opportunity to have 6th-8th graders participate in the high school golf program practices. This is approved by the
WIAA. The WIAA Amendments (18.6.0) states that middle school students can participate in practice. We do not offer a middle
school golf program therefore, students are not exposed to golf until they enter high school. This is my first year as the high
school golf coach and I would like to rebuild the program up. By letting the middle school students participate in our high school

golf practices, that gets them exposure to the sport earlier, and they will get to develop their skills and love of the game before
entering high school. Dylan Wirtzberger, High School Golf Coach
