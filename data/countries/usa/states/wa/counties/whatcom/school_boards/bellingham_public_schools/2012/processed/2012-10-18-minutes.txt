Stockburger attended the WSSDA Regional Meeting in Stanwood on October 8. The agenda
included a discussion of the charter school initiative, superintendent evaluations, and
implementation of the common core curriculum. Dr. Stockburger suggested the meetings should
be offered as a video conference to enable more to attend.
Steve Smith had several breakfast meetings with Dr. Baker. He also joined the other board
members for the board visit to Larrabee Elementary School, participated in the highly capable
learners linkage with other board members, families and partner agencies. He expressed concern
that it is difficult to measure the success of the HCL program and to know how to best educate
these students and what the next steps are. As a board, it is important to make sure every student
who qualifies is identified.
Dr. Ken Gass was impressed with the board visit to Larrabee Elementary School and how the
school engages the community. He also met with Dr. Baker for a breakfast meeting.
President Kelly Bashaw attended the parent nights at Fairhaven Middle School and Columbia
Elementary School. At Fairhaven, the school was showing the video, The Bellingham Promise.
Ms. Bashaw commented on the positive experience at Columbia. As a small school, it has a
different feel from other elementary schools, for example, everyone walks to school. Last
Saturday, the Washington Scholars were on campus at Whatcom Community College and
scholarships were awarded, including to two to Squalicum High School students.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report
Dr. Greg Baker reported that a team of eight attended the Association of Latino Administrators
and Superintendents Annual Conference from October 10–13. He reported that he was part of a
district team comprised of Amy Carder, Isabel Meaker and Janae Hodge who presented a session
on “ELL Program Improvement: Enhancing Support for Classroom Teachers, ELL Students and
Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Family.” He expressed appreciation to the team for a
powerful session and a successful trip. He indicated these tie to Policy Governance Ends 2.0,
Academic Achievement, and 2.1, Student Competence.
Dr. Baker indicated there are a number of task forces at work. The Facilities Task Force is in the
process of reviewing the different district facilities and will tour a number of buildings on
Saturday. Recommendations will be submitted to the superintendent in mid-November. It is
anticipated that the superintendent will present his recommendation to the Board in December.
Dr. Baker and Western Washington University Dean Francisco Rios have arranged for a joint
retreat October 26–27 with staff from Western Washington University, the district and
community agencies. Greg will send an article to the Board on Collective Impact.
Superintendent Baker also reported working with Western Washington University on teacher
evaluations. The state is recommending three options that districts can use to evaluate teachers. It
was suggested that if all Whatcom County school districts use the same evaluation form, WWU
could use the same form in their teacher education program. As Dr. Baker pointed out, WWU
trains teachers for other areas, not just Whatcom County.

ACTION ITEMS
Resolution 11-12, Replacement through New Construction in Lieu of Modernization
Superintendent Baker explained how a new Birchwood Elementary School will allow the district
to deliver an educational program that will be valued by families, staff and community, and
ensure that our students are cared for and prepared for the future. This directly connects to the
Board’s policy governance E-1, Strategic Mission and Vision. A new school will also help

ensure that district facilities are safe, clean, and conducive to teaching and learning (EL-9, Asset
Maintenance and Protection). Dr. Baker introduced Assistant Superintendent Ron Cowan and
asked him to summarize the two-year process the district followed, which aligns with the
Board’s expectations set in EL-12, Communication with the Public.
Mr. Cowan summarized the events of the past two years leading to the resolution before the
Board for their consideration. During Dr. Baker’s Entry Plan in 2010–11, he proposed
modernizing Birchwood Elementary School. This led to a community-wide Facilities
Springboard Proposal and a process that included meetings with Birchwood staff, PTA, district
office staff, as well as a specific outreach to the Latino community. With this information, the
Board appropriated bond funds previously planned for district office seismic retrofitting for a
Birchwood project. Over the next year, additional meetings were held with the Birchwood
neighborhood, school staff and families, and media. An architectural firm was selected and, after
reviewing all the information and studying the site, the architectural firm presented a
recommendation to the Board to build a new school at the same location. Mr. Cowan emphasized
that much listening and learning and sharing ideas occurred during this time and the information
gathered resulted in the proposal to build a new building that meets the needs and desires of the
neighborhood and school community.
Mr. Cowan responded to questions from the Board about the amount of outreach and community
engagement involved in this project. Mr. Cowan emphasized that this engagement has influenced
the final design of the building and, although it lengthened the process, it was a better process.
Steve Smith moved and Ken Gass seconded approval of Resolution 11-12, Replacement through
New Construction in Lieu of Modernization, for Birchwood Elementary School. The motion
carried unanimously.

POLICY GOVERNANCE MONITORING REPORTS
Monitoring Report for Ends 2, Academic Achievement, and Ends 2.1 Student Competence
Deputy Superintendent Tom Venable and Research and Assessment Manager Brian Rick
presented a monitoring report on Ends 2, Academic Achievement, and Ends 2.1, Student
Competence.
Mr. Venable and Mr. Rick reviewed the methodology used and explained it is a snapshot in time
of the district’s progress toward the mission, vision, and outcomes defined in the district’s
strategic plan, The Bellingham Promise.
Mr. Venable explained the relationship between 2.1, Student Competence, and 2.0, Academic
Achievement. The data presented will be used by the Department of Teaching and Learning to
shape their work throughout the year.
Mr. Rick reviewed the data presented in the report, including the evidence and artifacts matrix,
the methodology for identifying comparable high performing district, the data, and how this
information will be used to further the work.

The Board inquired if additional data is available, such as:
a) The number of ELL students who become proficient in English and leave the ELL
program.
b) The number of student who take AP exam and their score.
c) Similar data on individual schools and classrooms.
Mr. Rick indicated more detailed data may be available, but it becomes a factor of time and
money to gather and analyze it.
Mr. Venable thanked the Board for their interest and their work and thanked Mr. Rick for his
countless hours in assembling the data.
The Board thanked Mr. Venable and Mr. Rick for their work in compiling this data. They felt it
shows a picture and will serve as a guide in future years.

NEW BUSINESS
President Bashaw and Superintendent Baker will meet to discuss a schedule to revise the policy
governance policies.
Director Stockburger requested the Board consider lengthening the time for linkages from 60 to
90 minutes to allow for more input from the attendees. Director Stockburger also suggested the
Board schedule time to debrief from linkages and to establish norms to distribute at the
beginning of each linkage to ensure each attendee has an opportunity to participate. Dr. Gass
concurred that the Board receives valuable information at each linkage and finding a way to
assimilate it and debrief on the lessons learned would be valuable. President Bashaw requested
including this as a discussion topic at the next board meeting.
