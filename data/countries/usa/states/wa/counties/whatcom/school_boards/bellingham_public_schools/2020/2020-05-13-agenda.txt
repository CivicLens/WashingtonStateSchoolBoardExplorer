2.4 Approve Alderwood Elementary School Value
Engineering Study

Meeting :

May 13, 2020 - Regular Board Meeting via Zoom

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff is requesting board acceptance of the Alderwood Value
Engineering Study and the implementation plan in
connection with the new Alderwood construction project. As
superintendent, I have reviewed the referenced documents
and fully support the board's approval of the Value
Engineering Study and acceptance of the implementation
plan.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer, Director of Capital Projects

Explanation of Issue:
A requirement for receiving state construction funds for our Alderwood Elementary School project is value engineering. Specifically, the
district must complete a value engineering study and the board must accept the report and the implementation plan.
The goal of value engineering is to optimize both cost and performance in a facility. The organized multi-disciplinary approach (civil,
structural, mechanical, electrical) seeks to identify items that add cost without contributing to the function of the facility for possible
elimination. In addition, the process can identify items that add cost but do contribute to the function of the facility for possible inclusion. In
evaluating the quality, use, life, appearanceand required features of a facility, the value engineering team attempts to achieve value without
reducing quality below required levels while maximizing function.
A summary of the items we are recommending for implementation (Summary of AES VE Study Report_200114.pdf) is attached.
A copy of the full Value Engineering Study (Alderwood ES VE Report Final.pdf) may be viewed here.
Board approval of the Alderwood Value Engineering Study is requested.
