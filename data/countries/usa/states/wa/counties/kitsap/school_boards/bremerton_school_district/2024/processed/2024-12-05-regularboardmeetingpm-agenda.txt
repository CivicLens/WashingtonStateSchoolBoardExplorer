Recognition

Public Content
Background Information:
We honor the first people of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of the Suquamish
Tribe of Indians.
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its Indigenous
People, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or under-served.
This Land Acknowledgement is a formal statement that Bremerton School District recognizes and respects Native Peoples as traditional
guardians of the land and the enduring relationship that exists between Native peoples and their traditional territories.
We would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is within the ancestral territory of the suqabs People of
Clear Salt Water (Suquamish People). Expert fisherman, canoe builders and basket weavers, the suqabs live in harmony with the
lands and waterways along Washingtons Central Salish Sea as they have for thousands of years. Here, the suqabs live and protect
the land and waters of their ancestors for future generations as promised by the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855.
We also acknowledge the enduring presence and deep traditional knowledge of the indigenous people with whom we share this land today.

Assistant Superintendent Dr. Garth Steedman will present revised Policy 4260, Use of School Facilities,

changes was specifically focused to accommodate our partnership and lease with the Youth Wellness
Campus (YWC) and their anticipated events and activities at the decommissioned gym (located at the old
East High School site, now called the East Bremerton Community Gym). As the YWC is now defunct, the
Policy is being revised to remove those changes that were specifically added for that partnership.
Additions are marked as redunderlined, and deletions as redstrikethroughs.

Mr. John Fisher, Director of Facilities and Operations, has provided the annual Asset Preservation report for Board review.
The Washington State Legislature passed the Asset Preservation Rule(WAC 392-347-023)during its 2010 session. This rule requires that
school districts report to the Board the condition of the buildings in the Asset Preservation Program (APP) for schools built new or new-in-lieu
after January 1, 1994 when state construction assistance dollars were/are utilized. As required by WAC 392-347-023, the district adopted
Resolution 2009/2010-4 (on November 12, 2009) to ensure predictive and preventative repairs and maintenance of schools and to maintain
safe and healthy school facilities. Board Policy 6800 also has an annual reporting requirement to the Board. Each building in this system will
need an annual building condition assessment presented to the Board before April 1. The Bremerton School District buildings in this program
include:
Crownhill Elementary School
Mountain View Middle School
Bremerton High School 2007 Addition
