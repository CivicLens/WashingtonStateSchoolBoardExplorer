5. Reports
a. Superintendent
b. Teaching and Learning
Assistant Superintendent of Teaching and Learning, Dr. Julie van Wijk, presented the
board with information related to a drafted Lynden High School science curriculum
adoption plan. Curriculum adoption will be made with a focus on, and supported by, our
strategic priority of College and Career Ready Graduates, and will align with our MultiTiered System of Support (MTSS) framework. Dr. van Wijk shared a draft of a core
curriculum adoption maintenance mapping through 2029/2030. She also shared data
showing our 2021 and 2022 WCAS science testing scores which included state and
district passing rates. That data shows the effects the COVID had on our student learning
and how important it will be to pick the right curriculum to maximize student learning.
Dr. van Wijk then shared the LHS Science adoption timeline which will begin with
samples provided to the LHS science team in the winter of 2023. The goal is to have the
new curriculum implemented and being used in classrooms by Fall of 2024.
