Book Study: Dr. Baker said the district’s leadership team is reading Our Kids by Robert
D. Putnam, and the book is discussed during monthly administrative team meetings. He
asked the board members to consider whether they would like to participate in a similar
study of this book.
Committee Reports: At the August 25, 2016 meeting, the board agreed to form a
committee that would plan a study session for the purpose of exploring two topics: 1)
Board-Superintendent Relationships and 2) Board Advocacy. At tonight’s meeting, Mr.
Benjamin reviewed some questions that could be used if the directors were to interview
individuals representing other school boards, to get their perspectives on policy
governance. It was also suggested that individuals be interviewed from other
organizations (not just school boards) that operate under a policy governance model.
Next steps: the board members will continue to review the proposed questions, have
further discussion on how they will be used and who should be interviewed, and they will
determine a timeline and location for the study session.
CLOSING ITEMS
Board Assessment of Meeting: Dr. Smith assessed the meeting with an overall rating of
3+ (Satisfactory).
