Student Populations:
1. What key takeaways does your school have about how student groups are performing on
state and locally determined indicators of learning and teaching success?
●

There is a discrepancy between how student groups are performing on state assessments,
according to our WSIF data (above). White students are outperforming Hispanic/Latino
students. English Language learners are not meeting proficiency in ELA, or Math in great
contrast to non-English Language Learners.

2. What are some possible root causes your team has identified? Consider areas of strength
and what it will take to build strength in other areas:
●

●

●

●

●

●

Cause: Curriculum and assessments in reading and math were not common nor aligned.
○ This Year’s Strength: A new reading curriculum has been adopted. This has provided
teacher training and more instructional alignment throughout the district. A strong
foundational phonics program is also being implemented.
Cause: Essential standards and common formative assessments were not identified nor
guaranteed. This Year’s Strength: Essential Standards, in all subject areas, are being
developed through the district PLC process.
Cause: Collective efficacy was difficult, due to all teachers not having an identified
Professional Learning Community. This Year’s Strength: All teachers have a PLC team and
are collaborating regularly in building and across the district.
Cause: PLC (late start) time was not always aligned to student work and instructional
practice. This Year’s Strength: Staff is learning how to review student work in an effort to find
best instructional practices.
Cause: Multilingual curriculum was not aligned to classroom materials and lacked
assessments. This Year’s Strength: Curriculum was purchased to align with classroom
instruction.
Cause: Past attendance policies and procedures were not effective in reducing absences.
This Year’s Strength: An attendance committee meets regularly and has planned preventive
measures.

3. A central element of quality improvement work is being centered on our learners. Describe a

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan Addendum 2024-25
Cascade Elementary
typical student at your school that you think is a representational example of the student
population. (Do not include identifiable information).
a. What strengths do they possess?
SBA scores for reading, positive student culture
b. What challenges do they face?
SBA scores for math, growing need for special education/intervention
c. What are some important relationships in their life?
Parents, peers, school staff
Educators:
1. Describe the degree to which your vision and the equity statement are reflected in the actual
building culture and day to day activities of your school?
● We offer all students the opportunity to participate in leadership, jobs and additional
activities like STEM and Math is Cool. After school clubs occur at school, are free and
open to all. Leadership and jobs are offered with a conscious effort towards equal
representation that is reflective of the student population.
2. What professional learning and support have you identified that the school’s staff (e.g.,
administrators, educators, counselors, paraprofessionals, support staff, etc.) need to
strengthen the implementation of evidence-based practices for both teaching and learning, as
well as intervention supports (e.g., positive behavior interventions).
●
●
●

Professional Learning Communities (PLC)- Collaborative work aligned to essential
standards, assessment, interventions and extensions.
Professional Development (Materials) - Benchmark Advance, iReady, Step Up to
Writing, 95% Tier 1 Phonics
Professional Development (Instruction)- Instructional Framework (CEL) implementation
and Cycle of Inquiry

3. What professional learning and support have you already implemented that is proving to be
powerful and effective? What are your metrics for identifying them as successful?
1. We have begun implementation of all of the evidence-based practices above. All are
proving to be powerful and effective.
a. PLC Evidence:
i.
Process- Effective collaboration focusing on student work;
ii.
Products- Evidence of PLC product development (standards and assessments)
iii.
PLC Implementation surveys (District). Our staff surveys are favorable and
positive regarding PLC work. Cascade staff is ready and excited to move
along in our PLC learning journey.
b. Professional Development (ELA Materials and Reading Instruction)
i.
Evidence- Staff is using all of the ELA materials & assessments adopted by
Eastmont School District in Cascade classrooms.
ii.
The District Instructional Literacy Coach is working closely with our kindergarten

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan Addendum 2024-25
Cascade Elementary
and first grade staff on reading instruction.
c. Professional Development (Instruction)i.
Evidence- Conversations about instructional practice are aligned to the CEL
Instructional Framework. All teachers have chosen instructional areas to focus
on.

Systems of Support:
1. Consider the degree to which your school’s system of support is grounded in meeting the
behavioral, social-emotional, and academic needs of students: Identify areas of the strength
for your school’s system of support and how other areas will be strengthened.
Behavioral
● Strengths: We have staff that work to support behavior interventions through a tiered system
which includes our school psychologist, counselor, administration, Special Education
teachers and new for 23-24 a LAP Behavior Paraeducator.
● Needs: Implementation of our new Character Strong Tier 2 intervention. Continual training
on how to best meet the behavioral challenges of our students and aligning our new
systems.
Social Emotional
● Strengths: We have a tier 1 SEL curriculum which is consistent across the district. We use our
SEL screener and other indicators of need to identify social emotional groups needed.
Needs: Continual training on how to best meet the needs of our students. Curriculum that
addresses more problem solving steps.
Academic:
● Strengths: We’ve developed a responsive, data-driven system of interventions to meet the
needs of all students in ELA. Tier 2 and Tier 3 consist of individualized instruction and
materials targeting student needs. Reading interventionists instruct our most intensive
students. LAP- funded paraeducators assist students in small groups.
● Needs: Continual training on best instructional practices in reading and ensuring more
students reach grade-level proficiency. Continued training and support in math instruction
and implementation of iReady as an intervention system. EL instructional strategies training
and implementation around visuals, vocabulary and building background knowledge in
math and reading.

2. How did your school identify these areas of strengths and improvement?
● Through site council’s focus on school wide data trends in 2023-2024.
● Site Council beginning of year data focus.
3. How well do school and community systems interact to assure continuity of supports for
students? Provide at least one example.
● We are working to build the partnership between Cascade Elementary and CVCH this year as
it is a new partnership opportunity geared toward providing healthcare access to families who
struggle to access healthcare.
4. What areas have you identified as areas of strength, and where do you hope to strengthen

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan Addendum 2024-25
Cascade Elementary
and build further family and community engagement and partnerships?
● Our PTO is strong and welcomes more members each year. The school community is
supportive of offerings sponsored by PTO.
● When we host events for the school, our family attendance and involvement numbers are
high. This year we’ve added movie nights, 5th/6th grade activity night, an additional Books
and Breakfast.
● Goal: To strengthen our partnership with our parent communities and offer parents
opportunities to be part of our school activities.
● For the 24/25 school year, we have modified our Super Dad program to be more inclusive and
including moms. Our new program, Cub Crusaders, is an inclusive volunteer program.

identities of our students, engaging in meaningful discussions about diversity and inclusion. By
supporting our students in reaching their fullest potential, we ensure they become positive,
well-rounded, and essential contributors to our global society.

Student Populations:
1. What key takeaways does your school have about how student groups are performing on
state and locally determined, school-level, indicators of learning and teaching success (e.g.
Washington School Improvement Framework)?
When comparing Clovis to our state standards, the school scored the following:

Eastmont School Improvement Plan 2024-25 Instructions/Resources

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan 2024-25
Clovis Point Elementary School

Clovis is exiting the most students out of our ML program compared to all other schools in our district,
however there seems to be a disconnect with our hispanic students passing the SBA. We need to learn more.
When looking at our SBA Preliminary scores for 2023-2024, we need to focus our work in regard to item
specs and IABs to help students feel comfortable taking the assessment and help both teachers and students
understand the rigor and expectations.
In looking at our WSIF data (this is the first year we have had it) - we are looking very similar to most other
elementaries in our valley. We would like to focus on how to better support our latino and low-income
students.

2. What are areas of strength your team identified? What data supported them and how can
they be leveraged for areas of improvement?
We are proud of our growth this year and feel that we are keeping up with other schools who are more
established than we are. We have made significant gains in iReady, DIBELS and on our CFA’s. We are proud
of our “whole-child” approach. We try hard to know each student on a personal level.
Our Successes
● Our PLCs have become more intentional and meet on a regular basis with a focus on T1 and T2
instruction.
● Clear essentials tied to common assessments
● Having a support coach for Kindergarten and First grade has helped to raise our student scores.

Eastmont School Improvement Plan 2024-25 Instructions/Resources

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan 2024-25
Clovis Point Elementary School
●
●
●

The new curriculum for ELA has also been a huge success and we are seeing students' scores
continue to rise.
WIDA scores - We exited 16 students
We added more enrichment, extra-curricular and field trips.

3. What are some possible root causes your team has identified? Consider areas of strength
and what it will take to build strength in other areas:
Covid still has an impact on students, mobility, demographics, absenteeism, and external/internal behaviors
are some identified root causes for students who are struggling.
As a new elementary school, we have put some great things in place. The next step is focusing on essential
standards, like assessments. Learning more about the SBA item specs, rigor needed and implementing IAB’s
in grade 3-6.

Educators:
● What professional learning and support have you identified that the school’s staff (e.g.,
administrators, educators, counselors, paraprofessionals, support staff, etc.) need to
strengthen the implementation of evidence-based practices for both teaching and
learning, as well as intervention supports (e.g., positive behavior interventions)?
● Look at the ML/Latino populations and find instructional strategies that we can use to
increase their likelihood of growth in all areas. Implement accountable talk in all

classrooms on a daily basis!!

● Attendance and how to be more proactive to change our culture for students and staff.
● HERO awards for attendance for students.
● Parent/Family Engagement and how to get more families involved in events and the
education of their children.
● Continue our focus on a tight T1/T2 and T3 alignment.
● Take advantage of peer observations opportunities (intentional observations)
● Adding a preschool program.
● Continue to review current data and plan/change support based on that.
● Adding a SEL/behavior coach to help support T1/T2 and T3 SEL.
● Morning slides with SEL/behavior focus - based on SWIS data.
● Subs – All hands on deck to support our subs. Continue a culture where subs feel
welcome and supported throughout the day. Put absences in Red Rover as soon as
possible.
● Explore leadership opportunities for 6th grade students.
● Explore more opportunities for interactions between grade levels.
● Explore more opportunities to celebrate student learning throughout the year
(including specialists, intervention, etc.).

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan 2024-25
Clovis Point Elementary School
● What professional learning and support have you already implemented that is proving to
be powerful and effective? What are your metrics for identifying them as successful?
● Focusing and working in PLC teams - working on pacing, learning curriculum, alignment with
each other.
● Looking at assessments together and how effective they were and next steps for intervention.
● Adding CFA’s as teams so PLC team can be collaborate re: student learning and instructional
strategies used in the classrooms.
● Adding unit plans
Systems of Support:
1. Describe resource inequities (funding, staffing, materials, resources, etc.) identified
through conducting the Comprehensive Needs Assessment that will be addressed in this
plan.
Eastmont School District distributes funds and assigns staffing equitably across the district. Building budgets
are based on per pupil population and are assigned equitably. The district purchases the district adopted
curriculum for each building. Our resource challenge is maintaining consistent staff attendance which directly
impacts student achievement and social/emotional growth.

2. Consider the degree to which your school’s system of support is grounded in meeting the
behavioral, social-emotional, and academic needs of students: Identify areas of the
strength for your school’s system of support and how other areas will be strengthened.
Areas of Strength
● Experience Teaching staff: the average years of teaching experience is 14.8
● Strong teacher PLC groups
● 17 Bilingual staff members
● Student Support Coach
● Dedicated and active PTO membership
● Diverse population of students
● Implemented a Behavior Team that meets weekly to support our behavior students and analyze SWIS
data
● Full time school counselor
● Full time school psychologist
● Full time PBIS Coordinator
● Full time Behavior Paraeducator
● High Staff Retention
● School wide SEL curriculum with Tier 2 and Tier 3 curriculum for small groups
● Individualized Behavior Plans when needed
● Transitional Kindergarten and Preschool
● iReady individualized diagnostics and personalized instruction in math and reading
● Student Safety Patrol Program
● K-1 Literacy Coach

Clovis Point Elementary School
●

ML curriculum now aligns to our T1 instruction.

Areas that need to be strengthened
● Focus on more intentional interventions
● ML learners have historically underperformed their peers on state testing (speaking)
○ Accountable talk focus (support monthly from Darcy/Annie/Bridget
● Incorporate newcomer program to help our new mono-students
● IAB Focus and using them as instructional tool

3. How did your school identify these areas of strengths and improvement?
●
●
●
●

The MTSS Team (Grade Level Coordinators) and Site Council Team meet twice per month to identify areas of
strength and areas of need in academics and behavior
The MTSS team collaborates to determine the areas of strength and improvement for student behavior as well
as Social and Emotional Learning
The behavior team meets weekly to plan and support teachers/students
The SITE team is responsible for determining the areas of strength and need associated with academics.

4. How well do school and community systems interact to assure continuity of supports for
students? Provide at least one example.
●

●

Clovis staff use highly effective communication with the parents and the community through various outlets
including, Parent Square, Facebook, All Call, Phone Calls with parents/guardians, Parent Teacher Conferences,
IEP/504 meetings, surveys, volunteer opportunities, and scheduled meetings.
Parents review and sign a school - parent compact each year.

5. What areas have you identified as areas of strength, and where do you hope to strengthen
and build further family and community engagement and partnerships?
Strengths
Welcoming Environment - Clovis fosters a welcoming and inclusive environment that actively encourages
family and community involvement. We promote a sense of belonging while respecting diverse
perspectives.
Effective Communication Systems - Clovis implements clear and timely communication channels that
keep families informed about school activities, student progress, and opportunities for involvement
including newsletters, parent-teacher conferences, online platforms, and community events.
Family and Community Events - Our PTO organizes family and community events such as Welcome Back
ice cream at our Open House, a FREE Carnival for all families, Participation in the Apple Blossom Parade,
and a field trip for each grade level. We also partner with our local hockey team, the Wenatchee Wild. The
players read with students and students can earn hockey tickets for reaching reading goals. We also
partner with Silverwood Theme Park to incentivize reading. Students can earn a theme park ticket by
reading at home. Our high school offers a cheer camp for elementary students. The school district's
resource officers and other city officers are present in our building. This helps provide a very positive
Eastmont School Improvement Plan 2024-25 Instructions/Resources

13

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan 2024-25
Clovis Point Elementary School
community connection for our students. We also partner with a local church to bring lunch buddies each
Wednesday to eat with our students.
Areas we hope to improve
Barriers to Parent and Family Engagement
● Getting families to school events.
● Too much information going home - need to highlight what parents need to know in digestible chunks.
● Need to help parents schedule vacations/appts outside of school days.
Strategies to support successful school and family interactions
● Send a school activity calendar out earlier.
● Work on getting more parents active in PTO events.

Section 5: School Improvement Plan
(Component #2 - Well-Rounded Educational Strategies)
Using the guiding questions and tables below, identify your highest priority school improvement goals and
evidence-based practices (interventions, activities or strategies) for SY 2024–25. The goals should be based
off WSIF results, additional school-level data compiled in your Comprehensive Needs Assessment, and your
evaluation and identification of resource inequities. Please refer to the Step-by-Step School Improvement
Planning and Implementation Guide for more details and examples of SMART Goals, short- and long-term data
sources that may be used in the “Measures” column for support, and other helpful planning aids.
*Note: This process identifies strengths and weaknesses impacting student performance. It also sheds light
on the needs of the entire program. All students benefit from the interventions and services made possible by
a Schoolwide program; however, schools should place emphasis on strategies that help learners struggling to
meet state standards.

SMART Goal 1:
Reading
By May 2025, 90% of Eastmont K-6 students will be at Core or above on the Predominant
DIBELS measure. (2024-2025 Goal: from current 45% to 75%. All students will show growth.)
Data will be tracked HERE

What data will be used to determine the extent to which the school is on track to meet this overarching
goal? What does the school expect to see mid-year to know if they are on track to meet the overarching
goal?
Dibels benchmark assessments will be administered three times per year. with progress monitoring monthly for
those not at benchmark.
Eastmont School Improvement Plan 2024-25 Instructions/Resources

14

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan 2024-25
Clovis Point Elementary School
Who will monitor the progress of this overarching goal?
Assessments will be given by the classroom teachers with assistance/consultation from RtI staff monthly. The data
will be entered on the TACA document above.

When/how often will they monitor progress toward this overarching goal?Progress monitoring will

happen monthly for those not at benchmark.
Needs Assessment Data and Summary Statement (relevant to this goal):
Looking at the last two years of DIBELS data, we need to focus our attention on improving Dibels composite
and predominant scores in all grades levels. The Institute of Educational Research says, “Students who are not
reading at grade level by third grade begin having difficulty comprehending the written material that is a central
part of the educational process in the grades that follow. Meeting increased educational demands becomes more
difficult for students who struggle to read.”

SMART Goal (Specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timebound): Instructions - use the empty rows to
detail at least two evidence-based practices (interventions, activities or strategies) supporting your goal.
Add rows for additional activities, if needed. *Make sure activities include inclusivity and equitable
learning.

Student Populations:
What key takeaways does your school have about how student groups are performing on
state and locally determined, school-level, indicators of learning and teaching success (e.g.
Washington School Improvement Framework)?
WSIF: Proficiency rates in ELA and math for all student groups are above the Title 1 and
All Schools Thresholds, putting us above the bottom 10% of comparable schools;
thereby not needing additional support through OSPI..
● WSIF: Proficiency rates for all student groups in ELA and math, 50%-ile comparatively.
● WSIF: Strong trends in math growth for all student groups, 70-80%-ile comparatively.
Math proficiency, 60%-ile comparatively.

●

Eastmont School Improvement Plan 2024-25 Instructions/Resources

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan 2024-25
Kenroy Elementary
What are areas of strength your team identified? What data supported them and how can
they be leveraged for areas of improvement?
● WSIF: English Language Learners (ML); Our overall 2023 ML score showed progress over
the previous year, going from the 10%-ile to 20%-ile, putting these scores well above the
threshold line. This was exciting growth, since the 2022 scores had dipped below the
threshold line.
a. We attribute these gains to the following:
i.
All multilingual learners (ML) received tier 1, grade-level, instruction in ELA and
math. No tier 1, grade-level instruction, was restricted from this student group.
ii.
All students received targeted language instruction with a bilingual teacher 4
days per week, without missing core instruction in general education.
iii.
In addition to language instruction, all students received individualized
interventions and/or extensions during Reading Academy.
iv.
General education teachers, in collaborative teams, continually reviewed
learning data on essential grade-level standards and made instructional
changes to ensure learning for all students. This included small group, tier 2
instruction for ML students, when necessary.
● WSIF: Special Education; 2023 SBA math growth was 60%-ile comparatively for this student
group. The overall SBA proficiency also grew from a 2.56 decile score to 2.75 decile.
a. We attribute these gains to the following:
i.
The master schedule guaranteed all students received tier 1 math instruction in
the general education setting with intentional scaffolds and support.
ii.
General education teachers, in collaborative teams, continually reviewed
learning data on math essential grade-level standards and made instructional
changes to ensure learning for all students. This included small group, tier 2
instruction for SpEd students, when necessary.
iii.
Students with IEP’s received specially designed math instruction, based on IEP
goals, from highly skilled SpEd staff.
● ELA Strengths: District-adopted curriculum provided alignment in both Tier 1 foundational
skills, aligned with “The Science of Reading” (K-3) and ELA Essential Standards. Tier 2 and Tier
3 small group instruction also utilized district-adopted materials.
● Math Strengths: Through district alignment and the PLC process, teams unpacked essential
standards and created math proficiency scales. This allowed teachers to have a deeper
understanding of the rigor of the standard and how to assess, intervene and extend learning
for individual students.
● Grade level PLC’s: The initiative that binds all of this together!
i.
This “culture changer” each Monday, and throughout the week, ensures teacher
collective efficacy (the belief we are better together).
ii.
Teams are in a continual improvement cycle of standards, assessment,
interventions and extensions through deep reflection and analysis of their own
instructional practice.
iii.
Ensuring learning for ALL students begins with the belief that the teacher(s), in
highly collaborative teams, are the most important variable to student outcomes.
“How well we teach = How well they learn.”

● What are some possible root causes your team has identified? Consider areas of strength
and what it will take to build strength in other areas:
i.

ii.

ML needs: Prior to this year, there weren’t consistent instructional language
strategies, or ML curriculum, used across grade levels.
1. 2024-25- An instructional focus this year is student talk. Our ML teacher
is leading this work with our staff, guaranteeing frequent, quality talk in all
Kenroy classrooms.
2. 2024-25- Benchmark Express (aligned with Tier 1 curriculum) is being
taught in ML classrooms.
3. 2024-25- ELA (Tier 1) Unit plans incorporate language scaffolds and
strategies to support student access to grade-level standards.
4. 2024-25- ML teachers have regular PLC collaboration time, led by
Bridget Clarke, ML Coach.
5. 2024-25- Bridget Clarke is regularly on campus and in classrooms
supporting and coaching ML and general education staff.
Math Needs: Although our teams have devoted time to better understanding
math essential standards, through creating proficiency scales, unit plans and
common formative assessments, we are anxious to get aligned math curriculum
and materials through our math adoption in 2025-26.

Educators:
● What professional learning and support have you identified that the school’s staff (e.g.,
administrators, educators, counselors, paraprofessionals, support staff, etc.) need to
strengthen the implementation of evidence-based practices for both teaching and
learning, as well as intervention supports (e.g., positive behavior interventions)?

the gap in math across the grade levels and student groups.
2. A supplemental resource, iReady Personalized Math, has been purchased through the
building budget.
3. A supplemental resource to our ELA curriculum, Lexia Learning, which aligns to “The Science
of Reading” has been purchased through the building budget.
4. Supplemental materials to support foundational reading have been purchased through grant
money and building budget.
5. We are in need of Tier 3 materials, aligned to best-practice, to better support the needs of
students with IEP’s.
● Consider the degree to which your school’s system of support is grounded in meeting the
behavioral, social-emotional, and academic needs of students: Identify areas of the
strength for your school’s system of support and how other areas will be strengthened.
● PLC Teams:
○ Strength: PLC teams. Using agendas, norms, tracking progress of students.
Preserving PLC time for data review and instructional changes.
○ Need: Continue to learn about year 2 implementation. Learn about building
common assessments and Unit Planning through on-going PLC Workshops.
Embed TACA documents and student work samples into PLC protocols.
○ Need- Align to Easmont’s PLC Process & Product Goals- (see page 10)
● Behavior Team:
○ Strength: Behavior team meets regularly to develop behavior plans around Tier
2 and Tier 3 behavior students, based on schoolwide behavior data.
○ Need: Formalize meeting agenda to direct better discussions.
○ Need: Formalize a process to frequently review behavior plans.
● MTSS (Multi-Tier Systems of Support):
○ Strength: Data meeting process based on using current schoolwide data. GT
process with student profiles and distributed responsibility. Aligned curriculum.
Staff all trained in UFLI. Support from Monica Tun on foundational reading skills.
○ Strength: A regularly embedded time has been created for SpEd teachers and
our school psychologist to meet with teachers of students with Tier 3 behavior
needs and plans.
○ Need: Continual improvement of the systems associated with Kenroy’s GT
process and SpEd qualification.
● Grade Level Coordinators:
○ Strength: Regular meetings with effective agendas. District focus and
collaboration of assistant principals leading this work. Support from Behavior
Solutions.
○ Need: All staff, both certified and classified, continued understanding and
refinement of Behavior Solutions plan and implementation.
● How did your school identify these areas of strengths and improvement?
a. Site Council set, frequently tracked and discussed 2023-24 goals throughout the year.
b. In the spring, Site Council did a deep dive into our SMART Goals, and action planning,

Kenroy Elementary
from 2023-24. Click here for link to School Wide Plan Review 2023-24.
c. This reflection set us up for identification of Kenroy’s 2024-25 SMART Goals and our
process for setting, tracking and reflecting continually on student learning and growth
throughout the year.
d. Behavioral data was viewed and acted upon by the Grade Level Coordinators (GLCs)
several times throughout the 2023-24 school year.
● How well do school and community systems interact to assure continuity of supports for
students? Provide at least one example.
a. Multilingual Migrant Achievement Specialist (MMAS) supports our migrant and
multilingual students and families.
b. PTO: Our Parent Teacher Organization supports grade levels and programs equally.
c. School and District Migrant Nurses provide medical and link community resources to
students and families.
● What areas have you identified as areas of strength, and where do you hope to strengthen
and build further family and community engagement and partnerships?
● An area of strength is our outreach to parents through our MMAS. This year he, along
with our attendance secretary, is reading out to families early and often, regarding
attendance and the importance of school every day.
● To strengthen: Translation of documents and communication is a focus. This year we
have several languages, besides Spanish, being spoken at Kenroy. This includes ASL.
This has forced our system to look at communication in a different way and seek
support and guidance through the use of technology.

Lee Elementary
Student Populations:
1. What key takeaways does your school have about how student groups are performing
on state and locally determined, school-level, indicators of learning and teaching
success (e.g. Washington School Improvement Framework)?
Lee is surpassing the district’s averages in each SBA assessment. When comparing Lee to our state
standards, the school scored the following:
● 2023-2024 SBA and WCAS
○ ELA: 51.7% at or above state standards
○ Math: 46.4% at or above state standards
○ Science: 52.1% at or above state standards
For Fall of 2023 68% of K-6th grade students are on track to meet grade level skills in reading by the end of
the year as determined by iReady assessments.
For Fall of 2023 69% of Lee K-6th grades students are on track to meet grade level skills in math by the end
of the year as determined by iReady assessments.

2. What are areas of strength your team identified? What data supported them and how
can they be leveraged for areas of improvement?
Areas of Strength: Analyzing a collective review of Dibels, iReady, and SBA scores for each student. Lee
staff has focused on student support through reading intervention, DIBELS progress monitoring and
reading fluency, the school improvement plan, GLAD units and teaching strategies, the PLC process/data
collection review, a full-time counselor, Student Support Coach, and a full-time behavior paraeducator.

3. What are some possible root causes your team has identified? Consider areas of
strength and what it will take to build strength in other areas:
Covid still has an impact on students, mobility, demographics, absenteeism, and external/internal
behaviors are some identified root causes for students who are struggling.

Educators:
1. What professional learning and support have you identified that the school’s staff (e.g.,
administrators, educators, counselors, paraprofessionals, support staff, etc.) need to
strengthen the implementation of evidence-based practices for both teaching and
learning, as well as intervention supports (e.g., positive behavior interventions)?
Lee staff are focusing on strengthening safety: ALICE training and Standard Response Protocols (SRP).
Lee staff have identified a need to enhance our professional learning communities (PLCs). Staff are in the
process of implementing evidence-based practices and support guided by data to improve all students’
learning and reach academic high levels.
Eastmont School Improvement Plan 2024-25 Instructions/Resources

4

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan 2024-25
Lee Elementary
Student attendance has also been identified as a needed focus area.
Staff have identified behavior as a key foundation for assessing student learning and achievement. We
have an identified group who are attending a Behavior Solutions conference to help us strengthen tier 1, 2,
and 3 supports.
Many staff are participating in additional behavioral support training for evidence-based practices with
Sarah Clarke in addition to other behavior intervention workshops this school year.

2. What professional learning and support have you already implemented that is proving
to be powerful and effective? What are your metrics for identifying them as successful?
As identified by our SWIS data, Lee male students accounted for 47% of the school’s total enrollment and
represented 90% of all students receiving referrals. Female students accounted for 53% of the school’s
total enrollment and represented 10% of all students receiving referrals. Since identifying these problems
Lee has decreased the disproportionality of discipline referrals for male and female students by:
Positive male role models (current: Full-Time PBIS Coordinator, Full Time Counselor, Classroom
●
Teachers, PE, and Music teachers)
Meeting students where they are socially and emotionally
●
Frequent communication with parents
●
Communication with outside community resources
●
K-2 Literacy coach to support reading instruction (Monica Tun) -Metrics for identifying success is
●
an increase of reading scores on iReady and Dibels in the 2023-2024 school year.
Providing necessary support for high-need students
●
○ Check-in (after recess to discuss any problems that may have occurred)
○ Check-in (emotional “temperature check” throughout the day)
○ Scheduled break time in sensory room/sensory hallway
○ Reward systems individualized for students based on what motivates them
Our metrics for identifying success were analyzing SWIS data.
After identifying the math domain geometry as a schoolwide area of concern in the school year,
2021-2022, Lee made geometry a school-wide area of focus by using GLAD units at each grade level and an
essential standard. This led to an increase from 10% at benchmark to 44% at benchmark by the end of the
school year, 2022-2023, as shown in iReady diagnostic data.

Systems of Support:
1. Describe resource inequities (funding, staffing, materials, resources, etc.) identified
through conducting the Comprehensive Needs Assessment that will be addressed in
this plan.
Eastmont School District distributes funds and assigns staffing equitably across the district. Building
budgets are based on per pupil population and are assigned equitably. The district purchases the district
adopted curriculum for each building. Our resource challenge is maintaining consistent staff attendance
which directly impacts student achievement and social/emotional growth.

2. Consider the degree to which your school’s system of support is grounded in meeting
the behavioral, social-emotional, and academic needs of students: Identify areas of the
strength for your school’s system of support and how other areas will be strengthened.
Areas of Strength:
● Highly qualified staff with 85% of our certificated staff holding one or more Master's degrees
● 4 Nationally Board Certified teachers
● Strong teacher PLC groups with 100% of teaching staff being trained by Solution Tree
● 5 Bilingual staff members
● Student Support Coach
● Dedicated and active PTO membership
● Diverse population of students
● Lee scored above the district average on the English Language Arts, Math and Science Smarter Balanced
Assessment in Spring or 2023. Lee scored above the state average in Math and Science and was on par
with the state average in ELA at only a .7% lower average score
● Full time school counselor
● Full time school psychologist
● Full time Student Support Coach
● Full time Behavior Paraeducator
● High Staff Retention
● School wide SEL curriculum with Tier 2 curriculum for small groups
● Individualized Support Plans for personalized support
● Transitional Kindergarten
● iReady individualized diagnostics and personalized instruction in math and reading
● Student ASB Program
● Student Safety Patrol Program
● K-1 Literacy Coach
Areas that need to be strengthened:
● 69.4 % of our students come from an economically disadvantaged background
● 20.9 % of our students are identified as English Language Learners
● ML learners have historically underperformed their peers on state testing

3. How did your school identify these areas of strengths and improvement?
●
●
●

The MTSS Team (Grade Level Coordinators) and Site Council Team meet twice per month to identify areas
of strength and areas of need in academics and behavior
The MTSS team collaborates to determine the areas of strength and improvement for student behavior as
well as Social and Emotional Learning
The SITE team is responsible for determining the areas of strength and need associated with academics.

4. How well do school and community systems interact to assure continuity of support for
students? Provide at least one example.

5. What areas have you identified as areas of strength, and where do you hope to
strengthen and build further family and community engagement and partnerships?
Strengths
Welcoming Environment - Lee fosters a welcoming and inclusive environment that actively encourages family
and community involvement. Lee promotes a sense of belonging while respecting diverse perspectives.
Effective Communication Systems- Lee implements clear and timely communication channels that keep
families informed about school activities, student progress, and opportunities for involvement including
newsletters, parent-teacher conferences, online platforms, and community events.
Family and Community Events- Lee organizes regular family and community events such as Family Fun Nights,
Cultural Celebrations, and Community Service Initiatives. Lee’s PTO has organized family events like painting
pumpkins at Halloween and offering movies and babysitting for families to do their Christmas shopping. Lee
also partners with our local hockey team, the Wenatchee Wild. The players read with students and Lee
students can earn hockey tickets for reaching reading goals. We also partner with Silverwood Theme Park to
incentivize reading. Students can earn a theme park ticket by reading at home. Our high school offers a cheer
camp for elementary students. The school district's resource officers and other city officers are present in our
building. This helps provide a very positive community connection for our students.

Section 5: School Improvement Plan
(Component #2 - Well-Rounded Educational Strategies)
Using the guiding questions and tables below, identify your highest priority school improvement goals and
evidence-based practices (interventions, activities or strategies) for SY 2024–25. The goals should be based
on WSIF results, additional school-level data compiled in your Comprehensive Needs Assessment, and your
evaluation and identification of resource inequities. Please refer to the Step-by-Step School Improvement
Planning and Implementation Guide for more details and examples of SMART Goals, short- and long-term data
sources that may be used in the “Measures” column for support, and other helpful planning aids.
*Note: This process identifies strengths and weaknesses impacting student performance. It also sheds light
on the needs of the entire program. All students benefit from the interventions and services made possible by
a Schoolwide program; however, schools should place emphasis on strategies that help learners struggling to
meet state standards.

SMART Goal 1:
What data will be used to determine the extent to which the school is on track to meet this overarching
goal? What does the school expect to see mid-year to know if they are on track to meet the overarching
goal?
Homeroom data will be pulled and analyzed monthly.

Who will monitor the progress of this overarching goal?
The school’s Attendance Team, Grade Level Coordinators, and SITE team will monitor progress of the goal.

When/how often will they monitor progress toward this overarching goal?
Progress will be monitored monthly.

Needs Assessment Data and Summary Statement (relevant to this goal):
Attendance has remained a challenge at Lee Elementary. During the 2023-24 school year, only 31% of the Lee
student body achieved the 95% attendance threshold (152 of the 484 students enrolled at Lee during the entire
180-day school year). According to OSPI (Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction), “Attendance is a
critical building block for student learning. If students are not present, they cannot engage in learning. Attendance
is a powerful signal and a leading indicator of equity. It can signal when students might need additional support
and areas for system and school improvement. Chronic absenteeism impacts all students—no matter their age.
Students that miss just two days a month for any reason are more likely to not read at grade level, and more likely
to not graduate.” Our school community is committed to increasing attendance rates which will directly impact
student achievement.

SMART Goal (Specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timebound): Instructions - use the empty rows to
detail at least two evidence-based practices (interventions, activities or strategies) supporting your goal.
Add rows for additional activities, if needed. *Make sure activities include inclusivity and equitable
learning.
By May of 2025, Lee Elementary will increase the current student attendance 16.7 percentage points from 73.3%
(data from OSPI Report Card) to 90% total student attendance as measured by the Homeroom digital platform.

progress.

Needs Assessment Data and Summary Statement (relevant to this goal):
A student’s sense of belonging is fundamental to their well-being and academic success. Having a school
environment where every student feels safe, seen, valued, and connected is essential for creating a positive
learning environment.

By the end of the academic year, Lee Elementary students will increase the percentage of students to a 100% who
indicate they have an adult they can turn to for help at school, as measured by one-on-one surveys administered 3
times a year. This will contribute to the overarching goal of ensuring that all students feel safe, seen, valued, and
know they belong within the school community.

Needs Assessment Data and Summary Statement (relevant to this goal):
During the 2023-24 school year, Lee Elementary students, building-wide, earned composite scores of intensive
(21%), strategic (14%), benchmark (29%), and above grade level (37%). Because of these statistics, we need to
focus our attention on improving Dibels composite scores in all grades levels. The Institute of Educational Research
says, “Students who are not reading at grade level by third grade begin having difficulty comprehending the written
material that is a central part of the educational process in the grades that follow. Meeting increased educational
demands becomes more difficult for students who struggle to read.”

By May 2025, 90% of Lee Elementary K-2 students will be at Core or above on the predominant DIBELS measure.
Kindergarten
● Beginning: LNF (Letter Naming Fluency) will improve from 74% to 90%
● Middle & End: NWF-CLS (Nonsense word Fluency-Correct Letter Sounds) will improve from 76% to 90%

Student Populations
1. What key takeaways does your school have about how student groups
are performing on state (e.g., Washington School Improvement
Framework) and locally determined indicators of learning and teaching
success?
Our current educational strategies are falling short for our Hispanic/Latino, multilingual, low-income,
and students with disabilities populations, resulting in a disparity where white students are
consistently outperforming these other groups. This highlights a pressing need for targeted
interventions and support to address these inequities and ensure that all students have equal
opportunities to succeed.
2. What are some possible root causes your team has identified?
Consider both the identification of areas of strength and what it will take
to build strength in other areas.

· Discrepancy Between Boy and Girl Referrals: We will address this by improving our organizational
systems and creating a consistent referral process.
· Educational Communication: To resolve the lack of professional development and resources, we
will gather and provide teaching materials to help staff better communicate students' educational
progress to parents.
· Building Student Academic Vocabulary: We will enhance teachers’ understanding of
evidence-based vocabulary teaching strategies to improve student vocabulary development.
· Numbers and Operations: We will support teachers in learning strategies to strengthen their
students' number sense and operations skills.

3. A central element of quality improvement work is being centered on
our learners. Describe a typical student at your school that you think is a
representational example of the student population (Do not include
identifiable information!).
a. What strengths do they possess?
The strengths our students possess are resilience, desire to learn,
exposure to multiple languages and cultures. Our families desire to
support students with attendance and other community activities.

b. What challenges do they face?
Our students face challenges to include: vocabulary and

● June 26th Met with Breanna Day, Faith Webb, and Carrie Sorensen and working on CNA-Data
collection:
○ Demographics
○ Student achievement
○ Climate and Culture
○ Staff quality
● July 30th met with site council members and Carrie Sorensen to collect, organize, and
interpret CNA data collection and SIP plan. Worked on:
○ Goals 2 minimum 3 maximum
○ Focus areas we decide on: Decide as a team.
● August 7th Met with Dawn Wofford, Breanna Day, Sarah Barnes, and Carrie Sorensen to
organize, filter, and interpret CNA data. Worked on:
○ Identifying Causes
○ Identifying root causes and which to intervene on.
○ Prioritized Area for Growth
○ Student population
○ Educators
○ Inequities
○ Systems of supports
○ SMARTIE Goals
■ Identified 3 SMARTIE Goals
Connection to Implementation:
1. Summer 2024: The school-wide plan was written from the Comprehensive Needs Assessment
process, and the 2023-2024 school-wide plan reflection/review was conducted by the Site
Council.
2. SWP will be reviewed by the Site Council in August 2024 to approve goals and related action
steps.
Educators
1. Describe the degree to which your vision and the equity statement are reflected in the actual
building and culture and day-to-day activities of your school.
a. Rock Island staff members believe ALL means ALL students. However, our scores
reflect the need for tighter systems and support.
2. What professional learning and support have you identified that the school’s staff (e.g.,
administrators, educators, counselors, paraprofessionals, support staff, etc.) need to
strengthen the implementation of evidence-based practices for both teaching and learning,
as well as intervention supports (e.g., positive behavior interventions)?
·

PD on number talks and number sense

·

PD on vocabulary development and strategies to teach vocabulary

Eastmont School Improvement Plan 2024-25 Instructions/Resources

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan 2024-25
Rock Island Elementary
·

PD on behavior management and solutions

·

Training and resourcing on communicating academic information to families

3. What professional learning and support have you already implemented that is proving to be
powerful and effective? What are your metrics for identifying them as successful?
· We have implemented professional learning teams. We are measuring with whole
group test data and PM.
· Training on meaning-making strategies for multilingual learners. (access to content).
This occurred during the summer and we will be using pre and post-tests to measure
their effectiveness.
Systems of Support:
1. Describe resource inequities (funding, staffing, materials, resources, etc.) identified through
conducting the Comprehensive Needs Assessment that will be addressed in this plan
● Inequities: Not all staff have received training on Meaning Making Strategies for
multilingual learners
● Not all staff have been trained on the curriculum.
● Need for professional development on how to best respond to SWD
● Need for professional development on Tier 1 behavior management

Systems of Support
1. Consider the degree to which your school’s system of support is grounded
in meeting the behavioral, social-­emotional, and academic needs of
students: Identify areas of strength for your school’s system of support and
how other areas will be strengthened.
a. In our system, we use the SWD/ML Matrix to ensure we are meeting
the cultural and linguistic needs of our multilingual learners.
b. While we have the resources for implementing PBIS, not everyone
has been using it effectively. We will strengthen this by participating
in Behavior Academies by Jessica and John Hannigan
2. How did your school identify these areas of strengths and improvement?
a. We used behavior, attendance, SWD/ML Matrix, and survey data.

Eastmont School Improvement Plan 2024-25 Instructions/Resources

Title I Elementary Schoolwide Plan 2024-25
Rock Island Elementary
3. How well do school and community systems interact to assure continuity
of support for students? Provide at least one example.
a. We partner with Wild About Learning, to encourage reading in
school and at home. We partner with child advocacy groups, such
as SAGE, Catholic Charities, and Children's Home Society. We also
work with local police.
4. What areas have you identified as areas of strength, and where do you
hope to strengthen and build further family and community engagement
and partnership(s)?
A. Our parents and families feel welcome here at Rock Island
Elementary and knowing this, we will strengthen and further build
this relationship by offering academic nights.
B. Our attendance is a strength. The above data does not reflect the
current trend. Last year 79% of our students attended 90 % of the
time which is the highest in the district. We will continue to work on
attendance through ParentSquare messaging and classroom
rewards and incentives.
C. We hope to strengthen our math program by focusing on numbers
and base ten operations.
D. We hope to strengthen our ELA program by focusing on vocabulary
acquisition and development.

Section 5: School Improvement Plan
(Component #2 - Well-Rounded Educational Strategies)
Using the guiding questions and tables below, identify your highest priority school improvement goals and
evidence-based practices (interventions, activities or strategies) for SY 2024–25. The goals should be based
on WSIF results, additional school-level data compiled in your Comprehensive Needs Assessment, and your
evaluation and identification of resource inequities. Please refer to the Step-by-Step School Improvement
Planning and Implementation Guide for more details and examples of SMART Goals, short- and long-term data
sources that may be used in the “Measures” column for support, and other helpful planning aids.
*Note: This process identifies strengths and weaknesses impacting student performance. It also sheds light
on the needs of the entire program. All students benefit from the interventions and services made possible by
a Schoolwide program; however, schools should place emphasis on strategies that help learners struggling to
meet state standards.

lack of student productivity on daily work. This, in turn, hinders a teacher's ability to consistently identify
learning gaps and measure growth due to the subsequent work of student artifacts.

University plan in the High School & Beyond Plan (HSPB), student they will need 2.0
credits Foreign Language and 1.0 credit Fine Arts as listed under the “Student
Personal Pathway Credits”, otherwise those credits are flexible credits.
It is the policy of the Eastmont School District to permit students to earn credit to be

regulations of the State of Washington. A student who qualifies for Special Education
services shall satisfy those competency requirements which are incorporated into the
Individualized Education Program (IEP).

mastery or competency in those subject but did not receive high school
credits may do one of the following:
i. Repeat the course or courses for credit in high school; or
ii. Earn three credits of high school mathematics in different math
subjects than those completed before high school. The student must

Procedure No. 2410-P

1. A student who earns credit through a career and technical education course
determined by the district or by the office of the superintendent of public
instruction to be equivalent to a non career and technical education core
course will not be required to pass a course in the non career and technical
education subject to earn a credit in that subject. The student earns one credit
while meeting two graduation requirements, a career and technical education
requirement and the non career and technical education subject requirement.
The total number of credits required for graduation remain unchanged, and
the student will need to earn an additional elective credit.
Personal Pathway Requirement Option (PPR)
1. “Personalized pathway requirement” means up to three credits chosen by a student
that are included in a student’s personalized pathway and prepare the student to
meet specific post-secondary career or educational goals.
2. “Personalized pathway” means a locally determined body of coursework identified in
a student’s high school and beyond plan that is deemed necessary to attain the
post-secondary career or educational goals chosen by the student.
3. Students may use the PPR to substitute for one credit of Fine Art and/or up to two
credits of Foreign Language.
Publication of Graduation Requirements
Prior to registering in high school and each year thereafter, each student and his or her
parents/guardians will have access to the graduation requirements in effect for that
student (those in effect when the student enrolled in ninth grade). Graduation
requirements may also be included in the student handbook.

CREDIT REQUIREMENTS
Period of Eligibility to Earn Credits
Generally, credit towards high school graduation will be earned in grades nine through
twelve. However, unless requested otherwise by the student and the student’s family,
the District will award high school credit towards fulfilling graduation requirements to a
student who has completed high school courses while in seventh or eighth grade if one
of the following applies:
A. The course was taken with high school students, and the student successfully
passed the same course requirements and examinations as the high school
students enrolled in the class; or
B. The course taught at the 7th or 8th grade level has been determined by the District
to be similar or equivalent to a course taught at the high school level.
Students who have taken and successfully completed high school courses under the
above circumstances shall not be required to take an additional mastery/competency
examination or perform any other additional assignment to receive credit.

Procedure No. 2410-P

At the request of the student and the student’s parent/guardian, high school credit
earned before high school may be transcribed with a nonnumerical grade, such as
“pass” or “credit.” A nonnumerical grade will not be included in the student’s high school
grade point average calculations. High school credit earned prior to high school and
transcribed with a nonnumerical grade will apply to fulfilling high school graduation
requirements.
Before the end of eleventh grade, a student and the student’s parent or guardian must
inform the school if they do not want credit for the course or courses taken before
attending high school or if they want the credit to be transcribed with a nonnumerical
grade.
Awarding High School Credit
The District will award high school credit for successful completion of a specified unit of
study. A student successfully completes a specified unit of study by doing one of the
following:
A. Earning a passing grade according to the District’s grading policy;
B. Demonstrating proficiency or mastery of content standards as determined by the
District (the District will establish a process for determining proficiency or mastery
for credit bearing courses of study); or
C. Successfully completing an established number of hours of planned instructional
activities to be determined by the District.
Credits from Other Programs
The principal/designee is responsible for determining which credits will be recognized
by the District for students enrolling from another state approved learning program
(public school, approved private school, or home school), or from out-of-state, or out-ofcountry program. The District will accept credits from another Washington public school
or accredited state private school or accredited out-of-state public or private school to
the extent the credit matches a District graduation requirement—or the credits may be
counted as elective credits. The District will evaluate credits from unaccredited
programs or home schools as described below for home school students. Decisions of
the principal/designee may be appealed to the superintendent within fifteen school days
of the initial decision.
Alternative Programs
The District may grant credit toward graduation requirements for planned learning
experiences primarily conducted away from the facilities owned, operated, or
supervised by the District.

Procedure No. 2410-P

A proposal for approval of out-of-school learning activities will be submitted prior to the
experience, will be at no additional cost to the District, and will include at least the
following information:
A. The name of the program or planned learning experience;
B. The length of time for which approval is desired;
C. The objective(s) of the program or planned learning experience;
D. The state learning goals and related state learning standards are part of the
program or planned learning experience;
E. A description of how credits will be determined in accord with WAC 180-51-050(1);
F. The content outline of the program and/or major learning activities and
instructional materials to be used;

H. The qualifications of instructional personnel;
I. The plans for evaluation of the program; and
J. How and by whom the student will be supervised.
The District will keep a list of approved programs on file in the Superintendent's Office.
The Superintendent/designee will communicate the reasons for approval or disapproval
to those making the request.
Running Start
The Running Start program allows high school juniors and seniors to attend community
college classes (100 level or above) for part or all of their schedule. Students must be of
junior standing or above to be eligible for the program. Rising juniors, those who have
completed their sophomore year and have yet to begin their junior year, may enroll for
up to ten quarter credits, or the semester equivalent, during the summer academic term.
Students earn college credit, which is also converted and applied to their high school
transcript.
The District will provide general information about the Running Start program to
students in grades ten, eleven, and twelve and their parent/guardian(s).This will include
information about the opportunity to enroll in the program through online courses
available at community and technical colleges and other state institutions of higher
education, enrollment opportunities during the summer academic term, and the college
high school diploma options under RCW 28B.50.535.

- DRAFT -

Procedure No. 2410-P

In order to enroll in the Running Start program, students need to do the following:
A. Contact the college they are interested in attending and arrange to take the
ASSET or COMPASS placement test (if required). The test is offered at various
times and results are often available the following day. Minimum scores in
reading and writing are required.
B. Speak with their counselor to assess credits needed for graduation, then decide
which courses they would like to take at the college. Note that part-time Running
Start students will need to coordinate college classes so that they do not interfere
with their high school classes. Full-time Running Start students may take one
course at Eastmont High School.
C. Obtain a Running Start authorization form from the college or their high school
counselor. The counselor will sign the form after the student completes their
portion. A parent signature is required if the student is under 18 years old.
D. Take the authorization form to the college and register for classes. Once the
classes are completed, the college will notify the high school and credits will be
added to the student’s transcript.
Credit for Career and Technical Work-Based Learning
The District regards work experience as a part of the educational program of students
as part of the secondary school curriculum rather than just a device to relieve a staffing
shortage. The District may grant credit for work experience based upon the following
factors:
A. The school will supervise the work program.
B. The work experience will specifically relate to the student’s school program.
C. The work experience will represent growth in the student and the type of work will
have definite educational value.
D. The work experience will provide a varied job experience.
E. The career placement EHS staff member will supplement the work experience
with an adequate program of guidance, placement, follow-up, and coordination
between job and school.
F. The work experience may be a planned part of the credit given for a school
subject (e.g., sales training class).
G. The District may grant one credit for not less than 180 hours for instructional
work-based learning experience and not less than 360 hours of cooperative
work-based learning experience related to a student’s school program.
Alternatively, the District may grant one credit on a mastery/competency basis as
provided under WAC 180-51-050 (1)(b).
H. The employer will legally employ the student who must have passed his or her
sixteenth birthday.

indicating the student made satisfactory progress on the job.
J. The regular state apprenticeship program and school cooperatively develop the
student’s training, which meets graduation requirements standards.
K. The program standards and procedures align with the state career and technical
work-based learning standards.
National Guard High School Career Training
The District may grant credit for National Guard high school career training in lieu of
either required or elective high school credits. Approval by the District will be obtained
prior to a student's participation in a National Guard training program as follows:
A. MIL Form 115 or an equivalent form provided by the National Guard will be
completed and filed with the District.
B. The number of credits toward high school graduation to be granted will be
calculated and agreed upon by the student and an authorized representative of
the District. Such agreement will be noted on MIL Form 115 or an equivalent form.
C. The District may grant credit toward high school graduation upon certification by
a National Guard training unit commander that the student has met all program

1. All home school courses will be recorded as pass/fail on the Eastmont
High School transcript;
2. A student must be enrolled full-time on the Eastmont High School campus
for an entire year, complete all classes with passing grades, and meet
District and state graduation requirements. If a student attends Running
Start, the year of attendance on EHS campus must be prior to attending
Running Start; and
3. Grade placement will be made chronologically, according to the birthdate.
HIGH SCHOOL AND BEYOND PLAN REQUIREMENT
Each student must have a high school and beyond plan to guide the student’s high
school experience and inform course taking that is aligned with the student’s goals for
education or training and career after high school.
High school and beyond plans must be initiated for students during the seventh or
eighth grade to guide their high school experience and prepare them for postsecondary
education or training and their careers. In preparation for initiating a high school and
beyond plan, each student must first be administered a career interest and skills
inventory that will help inform the student’s ninth grade course taking and initial
identification of his or her education and career goals.
The District encourages parents and guardians to be involved in the process of
developing and updating students’ high school and beyond plans. Students’ plans will
be provided to students’ parents or guardians in their native language if that language is
one of the two most frequently spoken non-English languages of students in the District.
The high school and beyond plan will be updated periodically to address the following:
A. High school assessment results and junior year course-taking;
B. A student’s changing interests, goals, and needs, including identifications of the
graduation pathway options the student intends to complete to meet his or her
educational and career goals; and
C. Available interventions, academic supports, and courses that will enable the
student to meet high school graduation requirements and graduation pathway
requirements.
For students with an individualized education program (IEP), the high school and
beyond plan must be developed and updated in alignment with their IEP, but in a similar
manner and with similar school personnel as for all other students.
All high school and beyond plans will, at a minimum, include the following:
A. Identification of career goals, aided by a skills and interest assessment;
B. Identification of educational goals;

GRADUATION PATHWAY OPTIONS

A student may choose to pursue one or more of the pathway options described below to
demonstrate career and college readiness as long as the option chosen is in alignment
with the student’s high school and beyond plan.
Statewide High School Assessment
A student may demonstrate career and college readiness by meeting or exceeding the
graduation standard established by the State Board of Education on the statewide high
school assessments in English language arts and mathematics.
Dual Credit Courses
A student may demonstrate career and college readiness by completing and qualifying

School diploma or participate in the graduation ceremony.
Early Graduation
Students requesting an early graduation must complete the Request for Early Graduation
form and follow the required process.
Waiver of High School Graduation Credits
The Board seeks to provide all students with the opportunity to complete graduation
requirements without discrimination and without disparate impact on groups of
students. In so doing, the Board acknowledges that unusual circumstances may
result in a student's inability to earn all twenty-four credits required for high school
graduation. Unusual circumstances may include, but are not limited to:
1. Homelessness;
2. A health condition resulting in an inability to attend class;
3. Limited English proficiency;
4. Disability, regardless of whether the student has an individualized education
program or a plan under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973;
5. Denial of an opportunity to retake classes or enroll in remedial classes free of
charge during the first four years of high school;
6. Transfer during the last two years of high school from a school with different
graduation requirements.
7. Other circumstances (e.g., emergency, natural disaster, trauma, personal or
family crisis) that directly compromised a student's ability to learn.

Procedure No. 2410-P

Pursuant to RCW 28A.230.050, physical education requirements may be waived
upon written request of a parent/guardian on account of physical disability,
employment or religious belief or because of participation in directed athletics or
military science and tactics. This shall not alter the credit requirements established
by the Board.
The Board delegates to the superintendent or his/her designee discretion to grant a
waiver of a maximum of two elective credits required for graduation. A student's
parent/guardian or an adult student must file the District's with the superintendent's
office no later than thirty days prior to the student's scheduled graduation date. In
order to graduate, students granted a waiver must earn seventeen required subject
credits (four English, three Math, three Science, three Social Studies, two Health
and Fitness, one Arts, one Career and Technical Education) which may be by
satisfactory demonstration of competence as provided by WAC 180-51-050.
Seal of Biliteracy
To be awarded the Washington Seal of Biliteracy, graduating high school students must
meet the following criteria:
A. Demonstrate proficiency in English by (1) meeting statewide minimum graduation
requirements in English as established by the Washington State Board of Education
and (2) meeting state standards on English language arts assessment; and
B. Demonstrate proficiency in one or more world languages. For purposes of this
section, “world language” is defined as a language other than English, including
American Sign Language, Latin, and Native American or other indigenous
languages or dialects. The fact that a language is not written is not a barrier to
receive the Seal of Biliteracy. Proficiency may be demonstrated by one of the
following:
1. Passing a foreign language Advanced Placement exam with a score of 3
or higher.
2. Qualifying for four mastery-based credits by demonstrating proficiency in
speaking, writing, and reading the world language at intermediate-mid
level or higher on the STAMP.
3. Demonstrating proficiency in speaking, writing, and reading the world
language through other national or international assessments approved by
OSPI. OSPI and the federally recognized Tribes in Washington have a
language proficiency system in place to determine tribal language
proficiency with students for the Seal of Biliteracy.
Student with an Individualized Education Program (IEP)
A student’s IEP team must determine whether the graduation pathway options
described above are appropriate for the student. Expiring with the class of 2021, if the
IEP team determines that those options are not appropriate, then the student must earn
a certificate of individual achievement to graduate. A certificate of individual

achievement may be earned by using multiple measures to demonstrate skills and
abilities commensurate with the student's IEP.
The following process will be followed to help a student with an IEP graduate:
A. By the age of 14, the student will participate with the IEP Team (including a
special education teacher, general education teacher, parent/guardians, student,
and other school personnel and agency representatives who will assist the
student in achieving the goals of the IEP) in a discussion of transition service
needs that focuses on the student’s course of study.
B. As an outcome of the discussion, the IEP will include appropriate graduation
requirements based on the student’s individual needs and abilities consistent
with the student’s transition plan. Modifications to the District’s standard
graduation requirements may include:
a. Attainable alternate classwork or individualized activities substituted for
standard requirements;
b. An extension of time for the student to remain in school to complete
graduation requirements. The student may remain in school up to and
including the school year in which the student reaches 21 years of age.
C. The student will, in cooperation with his or her parent/guardian and the IEP team,
determine the following:
a. The projected date by which all graduation requirements will be met; and
b. The projected date and conditions under which the student will participate
in the graduation ceremony.
D. The student will have an IEP that incorporates all issues and decisions from the
above procedures. Any decision that modifies the District’s standard graduation
requirements will be made through the IEP process. Annually or as needed, the
IEP will be reviewed or revised to accommodate the student’s progress and
development.

Withholding of a Diploma
The District may withhold a student's diploma or transcript until the student pays for any
school property the student has lost or willfully damaged. Upon payment for damages,
or the equivalency through voluntary work, the District will release the diploma or
transcript. When the damages or fines do not exceed $100, the student or his/her
parent/guardians will have the right to an appeal using the same process as used for
short-term suspension as defined in Policy 3241 Student Discipline. When damages are
in excess of $100, the appeal process for long-term suspension as defined in Policy
3241 Student Discipline will apply. If the District has imposed other forms of corrective
action for violations of school rules, the District may deny the student’s participation in
graduation ceremonies. Such exclusion from graduation ceremonies is regarded as a
school suspension. In such instances, the District will grant the diploma.
The District may withhold a student’s diploma if any property of the Eastmont School
District, a contractor of the District, an employee, or another student has been lost or
willfully cut, defaced, or injured, with the damages exceeding $1,000, the District may
withhold the diploma, but not the grades or transcripts, of the student responsible for the
damage or loss for the earlier of either 5 years from the date of the student’s graduation
or until the amount owed is less than $1,000. If the student and parent/guardian(s) are
unable to pay for the damages, the District will provide a program of community service
for the student in lieu of the payment of monetary damages. Community service
completed must be credited at the applicable local or state minimum wage, whichever is
greater. Upon completing community service that reduces the amount owed to less than
$1,000, the student’s diploma must be released.
Running Start student diplomas will be held until final transcription of Running Start
grades has been completed.
