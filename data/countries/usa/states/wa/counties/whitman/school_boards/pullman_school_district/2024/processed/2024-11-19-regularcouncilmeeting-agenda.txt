Services in Pullman.

Public Content
On May 24, 2022 the Pullman City Council approved a two-year contract with
Whitman County continuing the previous relationship around District Court last
authorized by the agreement approved by the Pullman City Council on May 11, 2021
for the 2022 calendar year.
This contract is set to expire on December 31, 2024. Staff worked with Whitman
County on the concept of a two-year agreement that would make funding this activity
concurrent with the City's biennial budget cycle and provide some additional
predictability for these services. Due to various issues including potential legislative
changes on the horizon, Whitman County did not want to consider another two-year
contract at this time.
Basedon these circumstances and the needs of the community, city staff is
recommending the Pullman City Council authorize the Mayor to enter into the oneyear agreement attached as presented.

Recommended Action :

By motion, approve the attached resolution authorizing
execution of an Engineering Services Agreement with
Parametrix, Inc. for the Airport Drive waterline and sewer
conveyance project.

Public Content
The City is currently under contract with Parametrix, Inc. to provide final design plans
for improvements to Airport Drive (formerly Airport Road; the street name was
changed earlier this year). This work is entirely funded with a federal Rebuilding
American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) Grant Agreement.
The Citys Capital Improvement Program includes projects to extend both water and
sewer utilities through the Airport Drive corridor to its east end at Orville Boyd Road.
The design of the water and sewer utilities must be coordinated with the roadway
improvements to ensure that they account for each other. City staff envisioned that
the same consultant would design the utility work in parallel to the roadway design
work. Thus, when the City solicited consultant services for the roadway project, a
provision was included in the advertisement that the City could use the selected
consultant for other design services related to Airport Drive, including water and
sewer design.
Staff have since negotiated a scope of work and budget for the water and sewer
design work for Airport Drive. The full scope of work is attached as Exhibit A to the
Engineering Services Agreement. The project is to be completed on a costreimbursable basis with a not-to-exceed budget of $99,385 for the waterline design
and $194,540 for the sewer conveyance design. Funding for the design of the water
and sewer portion of this overall project will be from the Utility Capital Fund. The
overall project is included in the City's Capital Improvement Program. It is anticipated
that the water and sewer design will be complete by the end of 2025. The timing of
construction for this project is contingent upon the Airport Drive improvements project
being fully funded.
