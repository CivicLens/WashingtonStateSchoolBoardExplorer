Our Board of Directors PSD School Board Guiding Our District with Vision and Integrity Our school board is dedicated to fostering an environment where every student can achieve academic excellence and personal growth in a safe and supportive setting. As elected representatives of our community, we are committed to making informed decisions that shape the future of our schools. Our responsibilities include: Policy Development : Crafting and implementing policies that promote high educational standards and equity. Budget Oversight : Ensuring that financial resources are allocated efficiently and effectively to support student learning and well-being. Superintendent Supervision : Collaborating with and providing oversight for the Superintendent to ensure the district's strategic goals are met. Curriculum and Instruction : Evaluating and approving curricula that meet the diverse needs of our students and prepare them for future success. Facilities Management : Overseeing the maintenance and improvement of school facilities to provide a safe and conducive learning environment. Community Engagement : Encouraging active participation from parents, students, teachers, and community members to foster a collaborative educational community. Our mission is to support every student in reaching their full potential by prioritizing safety, equity, and excellence in all our decisions. We invite you to explore our initiatives, participate in our meetings, and join us in our dedication to student success and safety. For the purpose of enhancing teamwork among members of the board, district staff and the community at large, we, the members of the Peninsula School District Board of Directors, do hereby publicly commit to the following principles: We belong to the Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA) and agree to adhere to the Washington School Board Standards for Governance and the Standards for Individual School Directors . We recognize that the actions of individual school board members impact the effectiveness of the board as a governance body. Only the board as a whole has authority. Individual board members will not attempt to take unilateral action or speak on behalf of the board, the superintendent or the district. We will defer to the board president or his/her designee as the board spokesperson when making comments to the media, responding to group emails and any other forms of communication relating to board business. We will defer to the superintendent or his/her designee as the spokesperson for official district business. If board members make statements outside of their official capacity, they will make clear they are speaking for themselves and their opinions do not reflect the will of the board, the superintendent or the district. We will represent the needs and interests of all students, families and citizens in the district in good faith, without bias or favor, and in full support of current district non-discrimination policies and procedures 3210 and 3210P . We will lead by example by avoiding words and actions that create a negative impression of an individual board member, the board as a whole, or the district. We will use discretion when speaking in public, in written and email correspondence and on social media. We will actively listen when a family or community member expresses a concern about their child s school program or an operation of the district. If follow-up action is necessary, the board member will direct the individual to the superintendent or staff member nearest the area of concern for resolution. Board members will refrain from promising a specific resolution to an issue. We will refrain from responding or reacting to public comments made during board meetings. This does not reflect either support or opposition to statements; rather, it reflects the challenge of providing accurate responses to complex issues on the spot. Although board meetings are held in public, they are not meetings of the public. Examples of meetings of the public include community forums, town halls or task force meetings. We will extend professional courtesy by asking the board president or the superintendent to place an item on the agenda during the review period. Board members will strive to avoid bringing new agenda items up for the first time in a public meeting. We will be respectful of staff and community time during board meetings. Excessively long meetings should be avoided. We will come prepared and complete any reading or research prior to the meeting. If a board member has a significant number of questions, they should contact either the superintendent or the board president to arrange follow-up time outside of the meeting. Agendas Starting November 12, 2024, All Board Agendas will now be published in BoardDocs.
