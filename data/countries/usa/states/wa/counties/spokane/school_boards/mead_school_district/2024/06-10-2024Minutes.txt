A. Consent Agenda A – 2nd Reading Policy/Procedure Revisions & Adoptions
Vice President Gray, prior to asking for a motion to approve Consent Agenda A, which included

where the board directed that all three could be brought forward for second reading action via

B. Contract/Bargaining Agreement
Mead Principals’ Association
Superintendent Travis Hanson presented a tentative one-year contract agreement (July 1, 2024
– June 30, 2025) between the Mead School District and the Mead Principals’ Association for board
consideration. The association has ratified this tentative agreement.
Other than updating dates and the salary schedule there are no changes to the current CBA.
The 24/25 salary schedule has been increased by the IPD (3.7%) as provided for in the CBA and
the 1% reduction to IPD taken in 23/24 has been reinstated per the Letter of Agreement between
the district and association dated May 10, 2023.
Regarding the incentive stipend included in the salary schedule, Superintendent Hanson shared
it is an acknowledgement of the many evening and “above and beyond” requirements associated
with each job category.

Director Killman made a motion to approve the one-year tentative collective bargaining
agreement between the Mead Principals’ Association and the Mead School District, as presented.
Director Nolan seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously.
C. 1st Reading Policy 2152 Revision
Student Travel
Superintendent Hanson presented a revision to Policy 2152, Student Travel, for first reading
consideration. This policy was adopted on November 10, 2003 and last revised on August 30,
2021.
The presented revision removes the following sentence in the Special Event Trips definition
section:
As a general rule, a Special Event Trip, such as a trip by a high school band to Disneyland,
will be approved for a group once every four years.
As discussed at the May 20, 2024 board Work Session, this provision is currently applied very
inconsistently and band directors, in particular, feel it is arbitrarily limiting to their programs.
An additional revision is the removal of British Columbia from the list of Special Event Trip
destinations not requiring board approval. Both high school band directors were consulted
regarding this revision. While in the past the Mt. Spokane band, in particular, participated in a
regular, reoccurring competition in British Columbia, that is no longer the case. Therefore, both
band directors concur that any future trips to British Columbia should be submitted to the board
for their approval.
This was the first reading of a policy revision. No action was taken.
Noting no first reading changes were recommended, Vice President Gray asked that this policy
revision be brought forward as an action item at the next Regular Board Meeting.
D. 1st Reading Policy & Procedure 3424 Revision
Opioid Related Overdose Reversal
Family & Student Services Director Josh Westermann presented a revision to Policy & Procedure
3424, Opioid Related Overdose Reversal, for first reading consideration. This policy/procedure
was adopted on June 22, 2020 with no revisions since that date.
During the most recent state legislative session the requirement to seek to obtain and maintain
at least one set of opioid overdose reversal medication doses in each district high school was
expanded to include all district schools, not just high schools (Substitute Senate Bill 5804). The
presented revision to Policy and Procedure 3424 reflects this new requirement.
An ESD grant covers the cost of the medication and drug administration is included in the
district’s annual staff medication training. This reversal medication is locked up and stored in
the health room at each school.
Vice President Gray inquired about what the cost would be if grant funding was not available.
Mr. Westermann will find out and get back to Vice President Gray.
This was the first reading of a policy/procedure revision. No action was taken.
Noting no first reading changes were recommended, Vice President Gray asked that this
policy/procedure revision be brought forward as an action item at the next Regular Board
Meeting.

E. Establish Calendar for 2024-2025 (July 2024 – June 2025) Board
Meeting Dates
A draft Board Meeting Calendar (July 2024 – June 2025) was provided for board consideration.
One business/regular meeting is scheduled each month throughout the year. Additionally, one
work session is scheduled each month with the exception of the months of July, August and
December. While meetings are typically scheduled for Mondays, the presented draft calendar set
the May business/regular meeting for Tuesday, May 27, 2025, as May 26th is Memorial Day.
In response to a question from Director Nolan regarding budget adoption, Chief Financial Officer
Heather Ellingson confirmed adoption of the 24/25 budget will be an action item at the August
Regular Board Meeting.
Director Nolan made a motion to adopt the 2024-2025 (July 2024 – June 2025) Board Meeting
Calendar, as presented. Director Killman seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously.
F. Award of Yearbook Contract
Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson presented for board consideration a contract with
Walsworth to provide yearbook services to the district’s five traditional middle schools and high
schools for the 2024-2025 school year.
Following the May 6, 2024 Board Meeting where the board adopted Resolution 24-03, Rejecting
All Bids Submitted in Response to the Bid Specifications and General Requirements for Yearbook
Services, the district reopened the yearbook bidding process. This generated one additional
vendor, reduced pricing from one of the original bidders and increased pricing from the other.
The three companies who submitted bids were Walsworth, Entrouage and Varsity with
Walsworth being the vendor selected by the bid committee. In making this selection many factors
were taken into consideration with price/cost holding the highest weight in the decision making
process. Board policy requires that the district select the lowest responsible bidder. The selection
of Walsworth is a change from the district’s current yearbook vendor.
The Walsworth cost for 24-25 yearbooks at the district’s five traditional middle schools and high
schools is $374,048.90. The percentage increase from the current year is 15% at Mead High
School, 5% at Mt. Spokane High School, 0% at Northwood Middle School and -2% at Mountainside
Middle School.
This is a one year contract with the option to renew for four additional years. The district will
re-evaluate next winter to determine whether to renew with Walsworth or do a new RFP.
Following discussion, Director Nolan made a motion to award Walsworth the contract to provide
yearbook services to the district’s five traditional middle schools and high schools, as presented.
Director Killman seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously.
G. 2024/2025 K-5 School Supplies
Business Services Director Adina Grimsley presented for board consideration a contract with
School Specialty to provided K-5 school supplies for the 2024/2025 school year.
The Mead School District requested bid proposals for K-5 basic education classroom supplies
such as glue sticks, crayons, pencils, erasers, etc. Nine vendors submitted bids that met product
requirements with School Specialty being the vendor selected based on cost, references, strong
customer service and previous experience with the district.

The amount of the School Specialty bid is $127,179.34. This pricing is consistent with the initial
budget set for these products.
In response to board questions, Ms. Grimsley shared the School Specialty bid is slightly lower
($6,000) than what was paid last year, the supplies provided for each student are the same at
each grade level and that last year’s selected vendor, Complete Office, submitted a bid
significantly higher than what they submitted in 23/24.
Director Killman noted the School Specialty bid is approximately $27,000 higher than the
$100,000 budget amount referenced at a recent Work Session. Chief Financial Officer Heather
Ellingson shared the reference to $100,000 was an approximate/rounded number, not intended
to be an exact dollar amount.
Director Burchard made a motion to award the K-5 school supplies contract to School Specialty,
as presented. Director Nolan seconded the motion. The motion carried with three voting in favor
and one opposed.
H. Transportation Update & Award of Fuel Contract
Transportation Director Tony Davis, accompanied by Transportation Assistant Director Scott
Cole, before presenting for board consideration a contract with PetroCard to provide fuel
services to the school district in the 2024-2025 school year, presented a brief Transportation
Department update.
The area covered by Mead’s Transportation Department is 165 square miles. Over the course of
the year buses travel 1.2 million miles using a little over 126,000 gallons of fuel. The
department’s annual fuel budget is roughly $650,000. Mr. Davis shared a number of department
successes including an increase in the number of daily riders, continued vehicle maintenance
excellence as evidenced by outstanding state inspection results and a significant decrease in
negative student behavior referrals. Pre-Covid ridership was 8,379. Ridership decreased
substantially during COVID. Ridership has seen a steady increase over the past three years and
is currently at 7,209.
Regarding the fuel contract, the Mead School District requested bid proposals for fuel services,
including unleaded gas and diesel. PetroCard was the only vendor to submit a full/responsible
bid. The base year for the contract is the 2024/2025 school year, with four one-year renewal
options through 2028-29. PetroCard is the district’s current fuel service provider. The district
has been satisfied with their performance and is confident in PetroCard’s ability to meet fuel
needs in the 2024-2025 school year. Overall pricing is consistent with the 2023/2024 school
year.
Following discussion, that centered primarily on what vendors who were not considered
“responsible bidders” were unable to provide, and the notation that because of the continual
fluctuation in fuel prices the bid is not for a “hard” set dollar amount, Director Nolan made a
motion to award PetroCard the contract for fuel services for the 2024-2025 school year, as
presented. Director Burchard seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously.
Vice President Gray, referencing a recent traffic situation, expressed her appreciation to Mr.
Davis and Mr. Cole on the great job the department did in communicating with parents about
the delay associated with this incident.
Director Burchard expressed his thanks for the information presented noting in particular all of
the current and ongoing improvements taking place under the leadership of Mr. Davis and Mr.
Cole.

I. Award of Annual Fire Alarm Inspection Contract
Maintenance Director Travis Bown presented for board consideration a contract with Hiller Fire
to provide district-wide annual fire related systems testing and inspections for the 2024-2025
school year.
Six firms submitted proposals with Hiller Fire being the low bidder. A recap of bid scoring was
provided to board members.
The Hiller Fire bid is $41,517 plus tax. In the past the district has worked with several individual
companies to provide the services that were combined in this RFP. The cost this past year using
individual companies was approximately $55,000. If this pilot year goes well Mr. Bown noted he
would like to go for a multiyear contract in the future.
In response to board questions, Mr. Bown noted all six firms submitted qualified bids and that,
while the district has not used Hiller Fire in the past, he is very confident in their ability to meet
district needs. While not a specific line item in the Maintenance Department’s operating budget,
Mr. Bown noted $55,000 was spent in 23/24 on fire related systems testing and inspections.
Director Burchard made a motion to award Hiller Fire the contract to provide district-wide annual
fire related systems testing and inspections work, as presented. Director Killman seconded the
motion. The motion carried unanimously.
VII.

Reports
A.
Financial Report for the Month of April 2024
Prior to sharing a brief financial report for the month of April 2024, Chief Financial Officer
Heather Ellingson shared July 10th is the deadline for the district to have the 24/25 proposed
budget publicly available. She additionally noted that the budget can be revised throughout July
and August prior to board approval at the end of August.
Overall enrollment continues to be under budget while Special Education enrollment has grown
throughout the year (currently 1800 up from 1620 in September). Because of this increase the
district, in the 23/24 school year, will exceed the state’s Special Education funding cap. For the
upcoming school year, the overall budgeted student FTE will be reduced to 9900. The 23/24
budgeted FTE is 10,210 and current FTE is 10,137.
Ms. Ellingson reported that both Fund Balance and Cash Flow are better than anticipated. She
additionally noted the possibility of, at some point in the summer, needing to have the board
approve a budget extension. Any time the district spends even one dollar more than budgeted
the board must authorize the additional spending. While the district will still be using monies
from Fund Balance in the 23/24 school year (approximately $4 million) the dollar amount will
be less than projected when the budget was adopted last August. Fund Balance at the end of
23/24 is anticipated to be $8 million.
B.
Assessment/CTE Update
Data,/Assessment/CTE Director Moleena Harris presented the following Assessment and CTE
updates:
Assessment Update
ELA and Math MAP growth data comparing Fall 2023 to Winter 2024 was reviewed. This included
information on predicted growth compared to observed growth. District students at all grade
levels exceeded growth predictions for both ELA and Math. Math growth scores were particularly
high with all grade levels, with the exception of 1st and 6th grades, reaching the 99th growth
percentile.

In response to a question from Director Burchard, Ms. Harris shared, like in most school districts,
there was a drop in student scores post COVID. However, data now shows Mead students are
back on track and have gained back much of what was lost. It was noted that, for teachers, MAP
data, that includes three testing windows each year, is more beneficial when it comes to making
student learning adjustments than one time SBA test data.
CTE Update
In addition to reviewing the various CTE courses currently offered at the high school level, Ms.
Harris shared the district would like to add five new CTE courses in the 2024/25 school year.
The five classes are AP Psychology, Jewelry/Metals, Stagecraft, AP Environmental Science and
Environmental Science. Adding these classes would provide additional Dual Credit opportunities
for students.
The process for a school district to offer a course as a CTE equivalency was reviewed with Ms.
Harris noting the district has completed all steps with the exception of the final step which is
school board approval. Following discussion, that included teacher certification requirements
and a request from Director Nolan to receive information on what graduation requirements each
of the five new classes could/would fulfill, it was noted formal board approval of the five classes
would be an action item at the July 29th board meeting.
C.
Superintendent’s Report
On the topic of right sizing, Superintendent Hanson expressed appreciation to Business &
Operations Assistant Superintendent Jared Hoadley who, along with others, has been working
diligently, particularly at the secondary level, to have staffing match budgeted FTE at each
building.
Congratulations was extended to the Northwood Middle School Marching Band on receiving the
Junior Lilac Parade Grand Sweepstakes Award, which earned them the opportunity to march in
the Lilac Festival Torchlight Parade. Also at the Junior Lilac Parade, Mountainside placed 1st in
the large band category and Highland was 1st in the small band category.
Propelled by the recent track team 3A state title (boys), Mead High School won the 2023/2024
WIAA 3A Scholastic Cup. Additionally, Mt. Spokane High School had two students who were
award winners at the OSPI State Art Competition.
VIII. Remarks for the Good of the Schools – Public Comment on Non-Agenda Items
Matt Johnson, of Varsity Yearbook, shared his disappointment that after 10 years Varsity will
no longer be the vendor for yearbooks in the Mead School District. He commended the high
caliber of yearbook advisors in the district and noted three school yearbooks were featured in
Varsity’s most recent Portfolio publication.
IX.

At 7:55 pm Vice President Gray called for an Executive Session of approximately 45 minutes for
the purpose of discussing real estate.
At 8:45 pm Vice President Gray returned the meeting to Open Session. No other business was
