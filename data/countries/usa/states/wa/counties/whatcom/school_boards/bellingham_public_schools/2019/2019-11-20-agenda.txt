Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
Resolution 18-19 certifies the districts levy collections for calendar year 2020to Whatcom County. This adjusts the local levy to the levy
authority as calculated under state law.Under law, the board of directors is required to certify the levy amount to the assessor by November
30.
At the February 9, 2016, election, the voters of Bellingham passed a General Fund Educational Support and Operations Excess Levy in the
amount of $35,900,000 for collection in calendar year 2020. Recent changes in the laws regarding imposition of local tax levies and use of
local revenues have limited the amount of money that may be collected by school districts in the form of local levies for general operational
purposes.
During the budget process, we estimated the levy collection for 2020 at $29,844,511. Using the state's revisedformula, the district is eligible
to receive$2,500 per pupil, adjusted for inflation. The state official notice specifies that the district's levy authority will be $29,717,834 in local
revenue for 2020.
