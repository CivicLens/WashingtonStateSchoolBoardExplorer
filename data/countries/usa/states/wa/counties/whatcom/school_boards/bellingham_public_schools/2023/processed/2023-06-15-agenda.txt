2.4 Resolution 17-23 Unlimited Tax General Obligation
and Refunding Bonds, 2023

Meeting :

Jun 15, 2023 - Regular Board Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached resolution in connection with
unlimited tax general obligation and refunding bonds. As
superintendent, I have reviewed and approve this item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Kathryn Weilage, Chief Financial Officer
Explanation of Issue:
Resolution 17-23 authorizes the issuance and sale of unlimited tax general obligation and refunding bonds of the District in the aggregate
principal amount of not to exceed $122,000,000 to provide funds to acquire, renovate, upgrade, construct and make other capital
improvements to the facilities of the district. It delegates to the superintendent of the district the authority to determine the final structure and
details of the bonds.
This bond sale includes the second issue from the $122 million of bonds authorized by our voters in February 2022. We also intend to
refinance some of our bonds from 2013 at lower interest rates, resulting in a potential savings for district taxpayers of more than $8 million in
principal and interest payments. This is similar to when homeowners refinance their home mortgage at a lower interest rate. However, unlike
a home mortgage, with a bond refunding Washington State law requires there must be annual savings of total principal and interest
payments and the repayment term cannot be extended.
The 'delegation resolution' grants temporary authority to the superintendent to approve the final structure, interest rates, maturity dates and
principal maturities associated with the bonds and the authority to accept a bid for the sale of bonds. The advantage of a delegation
resolution is that it allows the district to quickly enter the bond market when conditions are favorable, adjust the structure of the bonds and
approve a bid, irrespective of the timing of a board meeting, within the bounds of the parameters established in the resolution. Without a
delegation resolution, the district's only option is to enter the bond market on the date of a regular or special board meeting which may or
may not be a date that is most advantageous to the district. You will notice several blanks throughout the document related to the form of
bonds and exhibits. These are provisions that will be determined as we get closer to the sale date. We will provide the board with a report
describing the final terms after the bonds are sold. We anticipate conducting the bond sale and refunding around August 24, 2023.
