Guideline for Public Comment:
The White Salmon Valley School District Board of Directors requests comments be limited to four (4)

appreciates community members sharing information during public comments. While the Board does not
respond to public comment, following the meeting, the Chair, Vice Chair, and Superintendent will together
determine the appropriate level response. Speakers may offer objective criticism of district operations or
programs but the Board will not hear complaints concerning specific district personnel. If public comment
exceeds 20 minutes, and speakers are unable to make public comments to the Board, please submit
your public comment by email to wsvsd.board@whitesalmonschools.org and it will be reviewed by the

opportunities while creating their personal road map to success. Part of this experience will include a two-day college
and career exploration trip to visit the selected colleges: Evergreen State College, Heritage University, and University
of Washington.Students will get a first-hand look at life and opportunities on college campuses. For students to get this
