LIBERTY SCHOOL DISTRICT
REGULAR SCHOOL BOARD MEETING
October 28, 2024
EJH Library
CALL TO ORDER: Board Chair Jeremy Engle called the meeting of the Liberty School District Board of Directors to
order at 6:00 p.m. The flag salute was given, and a quorum was declared. Others present were board members
Chad Cornmesser, Stephanie Stout, Chad Denny, and Superintendent Jerrad Jeske.
AGENDA REVIEW: No changes to the agenda were made.

SALUTE TO LIBERTY:
• Alex Saywers gave thanks to Holly Pratt and Erica Demateis for their work with the Sport-A-Thon, which
has now beat the past year fund raising.
• Jerrad Jeske recognized principals Alex Saywers and Aaron Fletcher for their leadership, dedication, and
impact on student success in honor of National Principals Month.
• Aaron Fletcher congratulated the FFA Parliamentary team for finishing 12th at Nationals.

SUPERINTENDENT REPORT: The following was a part of Jerrad Jeske’s report:
• Enrollment numbers continue to stay steady 565, not including TK.
• A record 850 maples bars were served earlier this month for Family Maple Bar Day. Just shows the
involvement of our community.
• The LCEF auction went exceptionally well. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who donated and attended,
especially to the board members who dedicated so much time over the past year to make it a success.
• The Cheney Free Press reached out in recognition of our district’s consistent achievement with state testing
in Math, English, and Science. This shows our staffs hard work with the students.
• Maintenance updates:
o This was the first summer, with the refurbished well and the new variable speed controller in
place. Connie Anderson says it was the first time in years she can remember that our water tower
has not had a low water alarm.
o Marshall and Connie added a couple coats of a waterproof sealant to the flat roof in the elem./jh
building. It hasn’t rained much but still no leaks.
o Marshall has gotten all the parking blocks at the high school secured.
o Icon Roofing came out and replaced shingles that were under warranty on the high school roof.
o The new suburban has already seen extensive use. Since we have had to use our van so much it has
been nice to have another vehicle to transport students.
• Transportation updates:
o The electric bus grant we qualified for will not cover the entire cost of the bus, let alone the
charging equipment that is needed. Jenny will look for additional grants to see if there is a way to
combine grants, otherwise the project will be put on hold.
o Our new bus we ordered last July still has not been built. Its scheduled build date is set for midNovember. I had Jenny reach out and get another quote so we could look to get another one
ordered.
• Ken Murphy, an architect from ALSC, came out last Friday to look at some possible ways to create some
additional space in the elem./JH. He is going to draw us up a few different options for us to look at.
• Thank you to Laurie Roecks for coming back and driving bus for us.
ELEMENTARY/JUNIOR HIGH REPORT: The following were a part of Alex Saywers report:
• October went very quickly, and we are almost to the end of the first quarter.
• We wrapped up the K-8 Sport-a-thon fundraiser and Erica Demateis told me that we earned over $24,660
from this event, which has been our best ever!
