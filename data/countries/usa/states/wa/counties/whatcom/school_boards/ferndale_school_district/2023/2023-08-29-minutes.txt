Dr. Erickson describe the reasoning behind starting the discussion of running a levy and the timeline.  In September a proposal will be submitted.  In October a resolution will be presented to the Board. Ms. Cool raised the question of what the lowest Fund Balance could be.  Mr. Deebach responded that the Board sets the minimum Fund Balance. There are two methods of calculation: rate per $1000 assessed value or dollar amount per pupil.  The lower of the two calculation is what the cap is set at. Currently, the amount per pupil is the lower calculation. Once the cap is set using that method, it is then converted to an assessed value. There was discussion of pros and cons of a two- or four-year levies.
