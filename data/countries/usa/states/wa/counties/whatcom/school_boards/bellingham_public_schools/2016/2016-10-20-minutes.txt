The Bellingham Promise? What are some examples of demonstrated success?

Update on 1:1 Technology: Executive Director Kurt Gazow and Director of
Teaching and Learning Bill Palmer shared a PowerPoint that included a review of
recommendations made by the Student Technology Think Tank and an update on
the timeline for bringing 1:1 technology into the schools. Staff at the three pilot
schools -- Squalicum, Options, and Kulshan -- will be engaged in professional
development this year as they are introduced to the technology; in 2017-18,
students at the three pilot schools will receive their devices. The process will
repeat, with additional schools added, each consecutive year. Mr. Gazow and Mr.
Palmer also discussed the devices currently being considered for student use.
They noted that a key area of focus in coming months will be partnering with
families to ensure they have access to requested resources and that questions and
concerns -- particularly on the topic of ethical and responsible use of technology
by students -- are addressed.

Mr. Benjamin made a motion, seconded by Dr. Smith, to approve the following consent
