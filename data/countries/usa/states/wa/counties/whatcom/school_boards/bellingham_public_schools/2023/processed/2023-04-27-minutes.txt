OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
April 27, 2023 – Options High School, 2015 Franklin St., Bellingham, WA.
Call to Order/Land Acknowledgment:
Ms. Diaz Hackler called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. She acknowledged that this
meeting is being held on the ancestral homelands of the Coast Salish people.
Roll Call:
Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler (President),
Jenn Mason, Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
• Hazel Terry is a student at Fairhaven Middle School who believes the schools do not
currently have enough paraeducators, and it will get worse with fewer paraeducators.
• Miguel Perry is a member of the Local 425 Carpenters Union. He stated there are
over 500 members of the union who have children attending schools in Whatcom
County. Those members include general carpenters, interior carpenters, pile drivers,
millwrights, wood framers, etc. The union sponsors apprenticeship programs and
scholarships for high school students. He noted that many Whatcom County general
contractors are hiring untrained workers, and he would like the district to hire only
general contractors who employ union workers.
• Manuel Callejas is a journeyman carpenter. His son graduated from Sehome High
School last year, is now an apprentice with the union and is doing very well with his
apprenticeship. He believes unions are good for families.
• Jennifer Werner is a former teacher, a current substitute and the parent of two
students in middle school. She supports school librarians, some who likely will lose
their positions due to budget cuts. She believes it would be worth it to look at former
budgets to try to mitigate this loss. The work of librarians often goes unnoticed. They
don’t just check out library books and are always helpful answering questions and
providing support when she is working as a substitute. Librarians are a key
component for literacy. She asks that the district reconsider, as librarians are
essential.
• Valeska Harper stated that becoming a carpenter’s apprentice was the best career
decision he has made. He is three years into a four-year program. Choosing a union
contractor is choosing a company that supports its employees. He would like to see
contractors hired who will provide a living wage to employees.

1.5

Tania Quijada Flores is the president of the Bellingham Association of School
Employees (BASE) and works at Carl Cozier Elementary School. Union staff serve
all students in the district. Although members have not yet been individually notified,
they are aware that cutbacks will affect the members of BASE. She has met with
BASE members in buildings to hear about their work. Their concerns include safety,
lack of training and an insufficient number of staff. Members are being pulled in too
many directions at one time and staff cuts will take us backwards.
• Kasey Lehmann is a union carpenter who lives and owns a home within the school
district. What happened at Sehome High School should never happen again. Every
contractor who puts in a bid should play by the same rules. If non-union workers are
hired, we can eventually say goodbye to Saturdays and Sundays not being workdays.
• Edward King is a Local 425 journeyman carpenter. He attended Bellingham Public
Schools and his girlfriend graduated from the old Options High School. He drove to
Lynnwood for work today, as non-union companies are pushing union workers south.
There is value in hiring union companies, as training and apprenticeships are
important. The union will not exist here if contractors are hired who do not employ
journeymen and apprentices.
• Lisa Marx is a resident of Bellingham. Her children and grandchildren have gone to
school in this district. Completing an apprenticeship changed her life as a single
mom. It allowed her to hold one job, instead of multiple jobs, while raising her kids.
The Highline School District recently hosted an event where students learned about
pathways into living wage careers. There are many grants available to school districts
in our area, and she would be willing to help if the district is interested. It would be a
win for students, the school district and the community.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Our district, like most others, is in the midst of difficult budget work. We don’t want
to lose staff. We have hired great people and it’s frustrating to see how the way
education is funded across our state and country is impacting our staff and students.
Two bills have reduced our district’s regionalization rate from 9% to 6% over the past
two years, and no one has yet been able to describe the regionalization system well.
The legislature was supposed to reexamine the formula this year, but that hasn’t
happened, and the model doesn’t work. The resolution on tonight’s consent agenda is
a legal piece as it pertains to certificated positions. Over the next few months, we will
continue to refine the budget, and our team is working hard to retain staff when and
where we can, especially those who provide support for students. Retirements and
resignations continue to help alleviate some of the cuts. Yesterday’s message to our
community helped many people understand the factors that have brought us to where
we are. Enrollment has dropped since the Covid pandemic, although the number of
staff has increased by approximately 200. Students need the support that has been
added, but the revenue will no longer support it. There will continue to be advocacy
with the legislature for them to provide a more realistic funding model.
• The High School Advisory Task Force has been working to refine the advisory class.
• The Sustainability Advisory Committee continues to meet; it is working on a Climate
Action Plan to eventually share with our wider community.

An event was held at Sehome High School this month focusing on the prevention of
alcohol and drug use. The district’s three prevention intervention specialists, as well
as community partners, led the event.
Wade King fifth graders recently hosted an exhibition to share their inquiry
presentations with parents and others.
There have been recent performances at our district’s high schools.
Dr. Baker shared photos of staff and community members being surprised with
Promise awards for their outstanding contributions across the district.
Dr. Baker responded to questions from board members.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Mr. Benjamin enjoyed the student roundtable at Shuksan Middle School. It’s great to
hear directly from students, and the AVID program does a great job of orienting
students to post-graduation while still in middle school. He also enjoyed the Cordata
Elementary School visit. He recently attended the exit interview for the annual state
audit of the district, where the auditors had a hard time finding anything to say
because there were no findings. He acknowledged the district accounting and finance
staff for their work. Approximately 70 people attended the WSSDA Regional District
Area 1 meeting last week at Mount Vernon High School. Parent voice, student voice
and conflict resolution were topics at the meeting.
• Ms. Mason also enjoyed the student roundtable, and she is now an AVID fan. She
noted the cohesiveness of the students in the program and liked the Socratic seminar
format of the meeting. It was apparent how much diversity and inclusion matters to
the students. She appreciates the updates regarding the budget and feels frustrated by
the lack of funding for education in our state. Every staff member we have is
important to our schools.
• Ms. Bashaw agreed that the student roundtable meeting at Shuksan highlighted how
helpful AVID is to so many students. The energy felt at the Cordata visit was great.
Regarding the budget, staff cuts are very difficult and higher education is going
through similar challenges. It’s important to lobby our legislators regarding the
importance of education funding.
• Ms. Rose is disappointed that she couldn’t attend the student roundtable at Shuksan.
At the Cordata visit, it was notable how the role of community is so important in our
schools. She saw a preview of Bellingham High School’s “Scapino” and appreciates
the district’s commitment to the arts. She expressed frustration with how the state
funds education, and she’s grateful to those who came tonight to advocate. She also
acknowledged how important trade unions are to families.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The board is impressed with the work done to attract more racially diverse staff. We understand
that hiring employees that reflect the diversity of Bellingham students may help to increase test
scores and encourage more students to graduate. We applaud events like the BIPOC job fair and
the Back-To-School Family Block Party to help our students feel included and loved.
The board also recognizes other commendable work, such as extensive efforts made to meet the
demand for substitutes, professional development efforts and recognition of existing staff.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
None.
4. Comments on the report itself.
Great job on the report. The board appreciates the use of bolded text to highlight new initiatives,

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
This is a difficult report for the board to address. After years of steady progress, the global
pandemic has impacted student learning. However, the board is unified in believing that the
superintendent and his team did very well under extremely difficult circumstances. There are
some highlights. We are once again on an aligned testing schedule and Bellingham’s proficiency
scores on state tests for comparable districts in 2022 look promising.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
The board understands that during COVID there was a decline in progress, not just among our
students, but all students. We expect to see scores improve over time.
4. Comments on the report itself.
As always, the board appreciates all of the work done in gathering data and the contextual
framework for writing this report.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• Graduation rates up for non-low-income students.
• A slight increase in students moving on to four-year colleges.
• More students that identify as a female registering for video game design, robotics and
computer programming.
• Appreciate adding capturing students that identify as non-binary.
DB:
• It appears that graduation rates continue to improve, though modest dips can be seen that line
up with covid years, as it does for all comparison cohorts. What is notable is that the
subgroups followed (IEP, low income, racial minority etc.) continue to rise and do not show
the same “covid dips.” This supports the conclusion that the district is making solid and
steady progress with these groups despite covid effects.
• The known impact of covid, and possibly other factors such as economic conditions, make
interpretation of some of the post-secondary data challenging. These external factors may well
have had such significant influence on these measures as to make the impact of district efforts
difficult to determine. This pattern appears to be true across the state. What is notable is that
the district’s efforts with IEP students appear stable, less affected by these outside influences,
and optimistic for continued future progress.

CDH:
• The board is impressed with extended graduation rates showing growth of 25 to 40 percent
improvement in graduation rates. We are also pleased to see that the 15 year trend shows that
less Bellingham students are needing “remedial” courses in college.
JM:
• Improved graduation rates for MLL.
• Improved extended graduation rates.
• Improved 7-year graduation rates.
• Gap between homeless/non-homeless students narrower than State average.
• Increased participation of female students in STEM.
KR:
• Overall graduation rates show significant improvement and put BSD above average and
closer to high bar peer districts.
• Graduation rates in years impacted by the pandemic remain steady or are in line with state
averages.
• Significant gains in enrollment of female students in CTE STEM courses.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KB:
• Graduation rates for low-income students are still behind non-low-income students.
• A decrease in students moving on to higher education after graduation especially two-year
colleges.
• Sizeable decline in students registering for remedial courses.
DB:
• None- other than to continue to track this data post-covid to get a more accurate measure of
progress.
CDH:
• None at this time.
JM:
• While recognizing the massive 11-year improvements in closing gaps, this is an area where
there is always more work to be done.
KR:
• Significant gap in 5-year graduation rates between students from low-income families and
those from non. While the rates align to the state averages and are improving, the gap between
cohorts shows less (though still significant) improvement for most cohorts. Much less
improvement in closing the gap between students with and without IEP. Graduation rates for
most cohorts at or better than state average, except for students with IEP – improvement rate
also lower than state average.
4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Appreciate the data sets that were included with this report.

DB:
•

The Ends reports continue to be filled with meaningful data and presented in a cogent,
understandable way. The board appreciates creative and new ways to look at progress, such as
breaking down students by GPA, just as an example.

CDH:
• Great job as always on this.
JM:
• Thank you for the in-depth analysis of community college-goers!
KR:
• Having the data set separate from the narrative creates challenges in referencing data
(especially when viewing on electronic devices). Would be helpful to either incorporate data
set into the report or have clear references like numbered tables instead of page numbers
(especially because page numbers don’t align to the number of pages in the PDF.
