  6. Action Items
A. Approval of Superintendent's Contract
President Freeman opened the discussion with a reference to the explanation received from the district's attorney confirming the board's obligation to honor the November vote. Director Swinburnson agreed with the explanation, adding that he is not a strong proponent of extending multi-year contracts annually. Instead, he prefers to renew contracts in their final year, similar to principals’ contracts. Though he hasn't been on the board long enough to vote based on merit, he emphasized the importance of honoring the board’s November vote.

Director Creydt shared her interpretation that the board discussed the contract renewal in November, but there is no contract extension to 2027 unless approved at this meeting. She further referenced Director Galbraith’s statement from the May meeting about not being able to extend a contract for more than three years. She believes that the board’s vote in November is not binding because it violates the state statute. Director Swinburnson responded with explanation of what that interpretation would mean, and discussion continued.

Director Swinburnson expressed his dislike for the contract's wording but acknowledged it was the contract accepted by the board. He would have preferred that the outgoing board had waited to allow the new directors to take action, but he accepts that this is not what happened.

Director Galbraith questioned whether the contract exceeded three years. Director Swinburnson clarified that the existing contract spanned 2023-2026, and the board’s obligation last year was to take action on extension by December 1, 2023. Director Galbraith disagreed with that interpretation, arguing it was inappropriate to leave finalization of the contract extension to the new directors.

Director Galbraith also expressed dissatisfaction at receiving the attorney’s comments “copy-and-pasted” into Dr. Granger’s email rather than having the full email forwarded to the board. He also referenced his prior complaint about the contract’s wording which uses "average" and "mean" interchangeably which he asserted was a conflict. President Freeman disagreed and stated that the words mean the same thing. Director Lazarus concurred, indicating that he had looked up the definitions to confirm they can be used interchangeably.

Director Lazarus noted that many decisions made by the prior board are binding on the current board, suggesting this situation was no different. He shared an explanation from former board president, Dougal Thomas, indicating that the superintendent is evaluated in the fall because new directors taking office at the end of the year lack experience with how the superintendent’s performance did or did not meet the board’s expectations. Director Galbraith replied by questioning why the previous board didn’t finalize the contract. Director Creydt asked about caps on expenses, and stated her opinion that the attorney’s answers were inadequate.

President Freeman made a motion to adopt the contract as written.
  The board voted to approve the Superintendent's Contract through June 30, 2027
  Motion by Cliff Freeman, second by Ben Lazarus
Final Resolution: Motion Carries 3-2
Yea: Ben Lazarus, Cliff Freeman, Ryan Swinburnson
Nay: Erika Creydt, Steve Galbraith
  B. Resolution 2324-09 General Obligation Bonds
Dr. Granger explained the informational materials attached to the meeting agenda which included conceptual drawings provided by Zervas Architects. He explained the additional plan for creating a covered play area on the tennis courts at Blaine Elementary School. If the resolution is approved, Dr. Granger will hold the district's first community information session on June 27.

Trevor Carlson of Piper Sandler shared financial details about the proposed capital bond, including its historical and fiscal aspects. President Freeman inquired about the better passage rate in February elections. Mr. Carlson explained that school measures in the February election have historically garnered more support from voters. He added that the August primary is more challenging, while the general election in November is gaining popularity due to higher voter turnout. President Freeman asked what factors could improve the passage rate, and Mr. Carlson mentioned the importance of good marketing and community buy-in.

The tax rate has decreased from $3.59 in 2003 to $1.62 in 2024, mainly due to the increased number of homes in the district. Assumptions and contingencies were explained to account for potential interest rate increases in the future. Director Creydt asked what the impact would be if assessed property values decreased. Mr. Carlson explained that the district collects a fixed dollar amount regardless of assessed value, describing the tax rate as a by-product rather than a driver of the revenue.

He explained the conservative assumption of a 2% growth rate in the district, although the average over the past two decades has been 7%. He described how bonds are issued in portions to manage interest costs, ensuring that funds are available when needed while maintaining a steady tax rate over time.

Director Galbraith asked for clarification about the 2% growth rate, and Mr. Carlson emphasized the effort to make very conservative assumptions. Director Swinburnson asked about the timing of placing the measure on the November ballot, and Mr. Carlson explained that the timing aligns with the expiration of the Capital Levy and payoff of other older bonds. Dr. Granger confirmed this and added that the Facility Committee had discussed various options and agreed that November was the best choice.

Director Swinburnson asked about levy funds shown on the infographic, and Dr. Granger explained that reference to a 6-year Capital Levy approved by voters in 2018 which has funded several smaller capital projects. Dr. Granger added comments to address community concerns about building new facilities while cutting staff. He stressed the need to communicate the difference between how the district can utilize funding from capital bonds vs. general revenue.

Dr. Granger shared that additional community members have volunteered to help promote the district’s bond initiative. Director Swinburnson voiced his support for the initiative, echoed by President Freeman who added comments on the antiquated middle school, including security concerns due to multiple hiding places and lack of sight lines.
  The board voted to approve Resolution 2324-09 which authorizes submittal of a $70,000,000 Bond Initiative to voters for the November 5, 2024 General Election. President Freeman declared the 5-0 vote.

Final Resolution: Motion Carries 5-0

  C. Committee to Prepare "For" Capital Bond Statement - November 5, 2024
Dr. Granger explained the district's requirement to seek committee volunteers to prepare "For" and "Against" statements for the voters pamphlet. As required by law, the district will continue efforts to search for volunteers to form an "Against" committee.The board voted to formally appoint a committee to prepare arguments advocating voters' approval of the district's Capital Bond initiative. President Freeman declared the 5-0 vote.

  7. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)
A. Discussion and General Comments
The board discussed the following topics:
Title IX Requirement Allowing Boys to Play Girls' Sports: President Freeman expressed his objection to the new statutory requirement imposed by the state of Washington, which mandates allowing boys to play in girls' sports. He wants to raise awareness about this issue and is curious about how the board can pressure the state. President Freeman disagrees with the state and federal governments imposing requirements that limit local control. Director Galbraith highlighted the corresponding issue of shared locker rooms, expressing his strong opposition to girls being required to see boys in locker rooms. Director Creydt referenced recent communication from OSPI regarding the Parents’ Bill of Rights. Director Swinburnson felt that the board should use its voice to influence change in the legislature's perspective. He emphasized that the board must adhere to state law, but it should also join forces with other districts to have their voices heard more effectively. Director Lazarus agreed and added comments on the need for girls to have their own sports, expressing concern about competitive advantage. President Freeman concluded the discussion by stating that the board should stay informed on this topic and join with other districts to amplify their voice.
Parents' Bill of Rights: President Freeman expressed disagreement with OSPI’s guidance which indicates that federal laws trump state laws regarding medical privacy for students, noting that voters in Washington State also disagree. Director Swinburnson also disagreed with OSPI’s interpretation of the state law. He commented on failed efforts to block the legislation, and he expects the issue of whether federal supremacy prevails to be determined within the legal system. He further believes that the district should not be put as a barrier between parents and children, unless there is a situation of abuse.
Policy 5251 Conflicts of Interest: Director Lazarus initiated a discussion about conflicts of interest, prompted by Michelle Schulz's letter to the board about her tutoring business. He stated that, as a teacher himself, he would never charge his students extra money for tutoring, and he shared an example of another institution in the state where this practice would be prohibited. Director Creydt questioned if this is a contract, bargaining, or policy issue, emphasizing that the school's mission is to ensure all children are literate. She does not see a conflict for a teacher to help students with literacy over summer break. Dr. Granger explained that the conflict arises from a school employee personally charging a fee for private lessons given to a student. Discussion continued regarding this issue being specific to summer break, as well as whether tutoring could be allowable for students other than those in a teacher’s own classroom. Director Galbraith acknowledged the need for extra literacy help, but he understood the conflict of interest policy. Dr. Granger commented on the district's inability to staff an elementary school summer program. He described how a balanced calendar could better address students’ needs for academic interventions with more opportunities throughout the year. President Freeman inquired about how other districts handle this issue and expressed interest in learning about alternative approaches. He summarized the directors’ consensus that Ms. Schulz is technically in violation of district policy and the board is open to considering alternative ways to meet this need for the benefit of students. Director Creydt proposed adding an update to this policy for action on the July meeting agenda, and discussion followed. Director Swinburnson asked about the board’s process for making policy changes, and Dr. Granger explained that most updates to policy language are provided by WSSDA. The board adoption process takes two months, with a first reading, followed by adjustments if needed, and then second reading and adoption in the next meeting. If no adjustments are made, it is placed on the Consent Agenda in the second month.
Director Visits to Schools: Director Galbraith described how he enjoyed his visit to Blaine Primary School but noted that Dr. Granger accompanied him instead of allowing him to visit independently. He expressed a preference to make arrangements directly with the principal and believes that visiting with just the principal provides a better perspective. Discussion continued regarding the directors’ desire for independent access to the schools, with consideration regarding impacts to principals and staff as well as courtesy for the superintendent. Director Galbraith indicated that he would, if requested, respect a principal's preference to have the superintendent present. There was general agreement that the directors would make arrangements for school visits directly with principals who could request the superintendent’s presence if desired.
Curriculum Adoption in Consent Agenda: Director Swinburnson expressed appreciation for the efforts of those involved in the curriculum selection process. He felt that placing the curriculum adoptions in the Consent Agenda denied the opportunity for acknowledgment and celebration of the hard work put into that process.
