Meeting :

Feb 26, 2024 - Board of Directors Study Session and
Regular Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the Budget and Enrollment
Reports as presented.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
January Budget Reports:
Fund balance and net cash: The beginning fund balance for the 2023-24 year was $3.8 million. As of the end of January 2024, the fund
balance was $563,000 (compared to $5.3 million last January 2023) and net cash is approximately $2.8 million (compared to $7.6 million last
January 2023). These balances have decreased from the previous month and while it is consistent with the normal pattern at this time of
year, it is at a significantly lower balance across this fiscal year than in prior years. Consistent with prior year trends, fund balance, net cash,
and revenues show a large spike in October from receipt of a large portion of local property taxes. December through March show declines
especially since the state apportionment allocation in November is only 5% of the total allocation versus 9% in other months. Fund balance
and net cash will continue to decrease in the coming months as the influx of levy dollars tapers down, until the next big influx in April.
Meanwhile expenditures remain at a fairly consistent monthly level. A short-term temporary interfund loan from the Capital Projects is
planned for the next few months and especially for the month of June which is typically the lowest point in the year for fund balance.
Local Tax Revenue: The district has received 44% of total budgeted General Fund tax revenues for the 2023-24 fiscal year. Tax revenues
received year-to-date amount to $4.25 million of the $9.6 million budgeted.
State Apportionment Revenues: The district's State Apportionment allocation is increased since actual average full-time equivalent (FTE)
enrollment is approximately 119 more than budgeted enrollment. In November, the District requested OSPI to adjust the enrollment figure
used to disburse the District's monthly allocation, to a level that would more closely align with the increase in enrollment that the district was
experiencing. This allowed the district to receive needed revenues earlier and supported cash flow levels for November and December. The
amount of the increase will be more evident with January's apportionment which is when the State makes its annual 'true-up' on its payments
to school districts. January is when the state adjusts from paying school districts based on budgeted average student FTE to payments
based on ACTUAL average student FTE. The remaining increase in apportionment than spread from January to August. The overall
increase in revenues for additional enrollment is estimated to be between $1-1.5 million dollars.
February Enrollment Report:
The February 2024 enrollment reports are submitted for Board review and approval. Actual enrollment for February 2024 was 5,424.44 FTE
(Full-Time-Equivalent). February enrollment decreased 8.07 FTE compared to January's enrollment. The average FTE taking into
consideration September through February monthly enrollments is 5,433.73. This is 119.73 FTE more than budgeted enrollment of 5,314.00.
Compared to 2022-23 average enrollment, the district is serving approximately 70 more student FTE in 2023-24 than the year before.
Previous Board Action:
Board acceptance of Budget Reports for December 2023 occurred at the January 22, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.
January enrollment was approved by the Board during the January 22, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.
