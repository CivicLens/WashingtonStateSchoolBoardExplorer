Public Content
The logging debris from the clearing of the future Hand-in-Hand/HomeConnection site needs to be removed because it is a fire
hazard posing risk to property.

Per district Policy 6220 IIB the standard procedure for obtaining work over $10,000 (paid for with federal funds) is to obtain
quotes from a reasonable number of qualified sources. However, due to the extreme fire hazard, this procurement is exempt
from this requirement as it is considered an emergency. The cost of the work proposed is reasonable and is what would be
expected in the local market.
District Policy 6220 ID defines Emergency as unforeseen circumstances beyond the districts control that present a real,
immediate threat to the proper performance of essential functions or will likely result in material loss or damage to property,
bodily injury or loss of life if immediate action is not taken. With the fire hazard of the chips, there is a definite risk of potential
damage to property, nearby residences, and adjacent forest lands. Once the chips are removed, the hazard will be completely
eliminated.
The local contractor performing the removal work has been authorized only up to $20k.
