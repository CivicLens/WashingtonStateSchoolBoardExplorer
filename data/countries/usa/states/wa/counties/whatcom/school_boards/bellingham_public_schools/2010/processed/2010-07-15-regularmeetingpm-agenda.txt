Explanation of Issue: Agreement for Interdistrict Cooperative Educational Services.

Background
The Northwest Career & Technical Academy is Washington States newest Skill Center. It is a consortium
of School Districts in Skagit County consisting of Anacortes, Burlington-Edison, LaConner, Concrete, and
Mt. Vernon School Districts. School Districts in Whatcom County have had initial discussions with the
consortium for possible expansion in future years.
There are now thirteen (13) Skill Centers across the state. Skills Centers are an integral part of the K-12
system, operating as an extension for the high schools within a local region by providing high school
students with job preparation skills. The primary purpose of Skills Centers is to give students the
academic and work skills to successfully enter the job market or advanced educations/training. Skills
Centers provide cost-effective, quality job training in programs that would be too expensive to offer at
every high school.
Instructors use competency-based, individualized instruction to help each student learn occupational,
academic, and technical skills at a high level. Instructors challenge, motivate and provide opportunities
for students to achieve in basic skills, critical thinking, leadership and work skills through hands-on
education, applied academics and technology training.
Skills Centers are governed by an administrative council comprising the superintendents of the
participating cooperative school districts. Local districts contributed to the original facility and equipment
acquisition. On the administrative council, each district has an equal vote. This year Whatcom County is
represented by Superintendent Ronald Spanjer of Blaine School District.
Classes started during the Spring of 2010. The program(s) are for juniors and seniors only. The
Academy's main campus is located adjacent to the Skagit Valley College in Mount Vernon, and offers
hands-on professional training taught by industry professionals in the areas of: Academy of Finance,
Culinary Arts, Dental Technology, DigiPen Computer Science AP, DigiPen Sustainable Technology
Design, Medical Technology, and Veterinary Technology. The Academy will also feature a satellite
program, with a facility located in heart of the marine industry in Anacortes, which will focus on Marine
Technology.
Recommendation
Bellingham School District currently has one student enrolled in the DigiPen Computer Science/Video
Game Design program. I am recommending approval of this cooperative agreement between the
Bellingham School District and the Northwest Career and Technical Academy for summer 2010 only.

2.06 Ratify Acting Superintendent Brown's Signature City of Bellingham Public Trail Easement

Action (Consent)

Public Content
Superintendent's
Recommendation The Superintendent recommends approval.
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Business and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
In 2007 the annexation process associated with the Cordata Elementary School site on Aldrich Road
required us to grant the City an easement allowing them to construct a north/south trail through our
school property. At that time the specific details such as exact location, size, etc., of the trail and
accompanying easement were not finalized as they had not yet been determined or submitted to various
agencies for approval. However, in order for the annexation to proceed, the City required some
assurance from the district that in the future the district would grant a specific trail easement. On
November 8, 2007, the Board authorized then Superintendent Vedra to enter into a Concomitant
Agreement to provide assurance that the District would grant a trail easement.
The time has now come to grant the City the actual easement to construct and operate the trail. Since the
Board had earlier approved the Concomitant Agreement indicating they would grant the trail easement,
then Acting Superintendent Brown signed the easement on June 25, 2010. This allowed us to obtain our
building permit on June 29, 2010, rather than waiting until July 16, 2010.
I am requesting the Board ratify Acting Superintendent Browns signature on the attached Public Trail
Construction and Operating Easement.
Mr. Cowan will be happy to answer any questions.

Explanation of Issue:

Attached are the results for the Floor Covering (Carpet & Vinyl) Bid. Bids were solicited from five local
vendors, Great Floors; Lynden Floor Design; Walkers Carpet One; Rubensteins Contract Carpet; and
Chas H. Beresford Co., and advertised in the Bellingham Herald and on our website. Four bidders
responded and the bid was opened June 30, 2010. After opening, two bids were rejected because they
failed to follow bidding directions.
Walkers Carpet One was the low bid for installation and Great Floors was the low bid for repairs. Given
the future project agenda, we will be doing more repairs than new installation during the 2010-11 school
year thus making Great Floors the lowest responsible bidder. After conferring with Buildings and Grounds
Manager Mike Anderson, I request that the Board approve the award to Great Floors.

TO: Doug Kyles, Executive Director for School Administration
FROM: Eric Paige, Principal of Larrabee Elementary
DATE: June 20, 2010
RE: Student Trip Camp Lutherwood
Larrabee Elementary School is continuing its emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math
(STEM). As part of this focus, I am requesting permission for Larrabee fourth graders to attend an
overnight field trip at Camp Lutherwood, on Lake Samish, to study environmental sciences. Students will
take a BSD bus to the camp on the morning of September 29 and will return to Larrabee via a BSD bus
on October 1. The cost of the program will be $35 per student, and the Larrabee PTA will provide
scholarships for families who need financial assistance. All Larrabee fourth graders will be able to attend.
Camp Lutherwood has aligned their science lessons with several of the Washington Essential Academic
Learning Requirements. The lessons will emphasize the concepts of: Energy Flow, Bio-diversity,
Sustainability, Interrelationships of Living Organisms, and the Water Cycle. These are concepts that our
fourth graders will be learning in the general education classroom, and this field trip will allow them to
apply their experiences to the classroom learning. On the last day of the field trip students will complete a
service learning project that is aligned with science concepts learned the previous two days.
Board Policy 2320 will be followed for this field trip and Denise Seuss, BSD Risk Manager, has reviewed
the liability release form to be signed by Larrabee families.

Superintendent's
Recommendation:
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Business and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
Attached is Resolution 14-10 which if approved by the Board, would formally adopt the 2010-11 budget
for the Bellingham School District.
We made a couple of minor changes in the General Fund since we reviewed the preliminary budget on
June 17. The largest change removed $150,000 from Program 58 as a result of the district not receiving
a Human Resources grant. The other changes involved minor adjustments in budgeting for benefits
associated with substitutes.
There were no changes made between the preliminary budget and the final budget for the other four
funds.
After carefully overseeing the budget process and a thorough review of the budget assumptions and
resulting calculations, I recommend that the 2010-11 budget be adopted in accordance with Resolution
14-10.

Explanation of Issue: American Sign Language (ASL) Course Approval for the 2010-11 School Year

Background
I am requesting course approval for an American Sign Language (ASL) course to be offered at Sehome
High School for the 2010-11 school year. The special circumstances regarding this request for a new
course came up just this spring from Phyllis Textor, Sehome Principal, although the deadline for new
course proposals were October of 2009. The rationale for this special request is partly due to the
Bellingham School Districts new two-year world language graduation requirement which applies to next
years entering Freshman Class of 2014. Additionally, the World Language Task Force recommended
American Sign Language as one of the potential pathways to satisfying the new graduation requirements.
It has also been confirmed that the American Sign Language course and its credits are accepted for
college entrance requirements.

Due to the timeliness of Sehome's request and existing staffing capacity to offer American Sign
Language, together with student survey data supporting the student interest/demand for American Sign
Language, Acting Superintendent Sherrie Brown approved the shortcut and encouraged its creation to be
offered for the 2010-2011 school year.
Recommendation
I am recommending approval of the American Sign Language course for the 2010-11 school year.
