The Human Body and Internship course at Oak Harbor High School provides approximately 33 students the opportunity to
explore healthcare careers. The first and second trimesters focus on human anatomy and physiology, medical terminology, legal
aspects of patient care, and American Red Cross certification in First Aid, Bloodborne Pathogens, and Adult/Child/Infant CPR

/AED. During the 3rd trimester, the students apply skills and training in clinical settings in unpaid job-shadowing opportunities
with local health care providers. These on-the-job experiences allow our students to make informed choices about future
education and career goals.
