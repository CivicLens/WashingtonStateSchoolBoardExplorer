Blaine Primary School: Principal Michelle McKeown and Assistant Principal Kelli Alonso reported. Details were provided on social emotional growth goals, particularly in the area of physical and emotional safety. In literacy, handwriting was identified as a significant area in need of growth. Director Leu asked about the relation between CCSS and state assessments, and discussion followed.

Ms. Alonso answered with a description of the significant district investment of work that has already been done which is paying off now in providing critical support to students. Director Gibson asked for more information about student challenges with handwriting, and Ms. McKeown described the collaborative work being done with the district's occupational therapists to help students properly develop the motor skills needed for this purpose.
Blaine Elementary School: Principal Jordan Radke and Assistant Principal Kristen Bauer reported. Assessment results in the areas of ELA, Math, and SEL show both challenges and successes. Specific goals and action steps were outlined to clearly describe what all students should know and be able to do by the end of 2022-23. Director Leu asked how schools will return the focus to academics after placing such a high focus on SEL during the COVID pandemic's social restrictions. Mr. Radke described efforts to provide quality instruction using the tools that are available. Ms. Bauer added comments on PLC work aimed at improving instruction collaboratively at the K-5 level. Director Creydt asked about tutoring, and Ms. Bauer described the use of classroom interventions. President Thomas commended the school's leadership for their team-building efforts.
Blaine Middle School: Principal Darren Benson and Assistant Principal Wayne Vezzetti reported. This year will see the return of many annual events that had been put on hold during the pandemic. STAR and SBA data from 2021-22 was reviewed. SEL work will continue to focus on developing students' sense of belonging. A strong focus on collaborative teams is aimed at working purposefully to improve instruction. Specific areas of behavioral expectations for students will be emphasized. AVID activities will help to bring the "fun" to school. Standards-based grading will be studied throughout the coming year with the goal of implementing this method in the 2023-24 school year. Director Creydt asked how many students participated in the school's summer recovery program and whether it had helped for the district to provide it at no cost to families. Discussion followed and Mr. Benson shared details about services that were provided to approximately 60 students. Director Nunamaker asked how students qualified for the summer program and Mr. Benson described the evaluation process which was specific to the 2021-22 school year. Director Gibson commended Mr. Benson for his efforts to personally meet with students virtually when there was a barrier to physical access. President Thomas asked about the district's literacy curriculum, and Dr. Stacy Thomas described the new MyPerspectives curriculum that has been adopted for high school and will be piloted this coming year by one 7th grade classroom.
Blaine High School: Principal Scott Ellis and Assistant Principal Beth Eide reported. Data collection from the 2021-22 school year was reviewed for Math, ELA, and SEL. CEE data showed the level at which teachers felt supported last spring by professional development in the area of SEL, and there was discussion about this survey taking place around the time that pandemic restrictions were lifted in spring 2022. Many activities and groups will resume this year, including Link Crew and an in-person Open House. Ms. Eide described efforts to teach adults in the building how to manage their own social emotional needs in order to meet the needs of students and to model good practices. Mr. Ellis described efforts to balance SEL with increased academic rigor in providing a guaranteed viable curriculum. Goals for collaborative PLC work were reviewed. President Thomas asked about the 2022 graduation rate which Mr. Ellis indicated would be available in September. Director Creydt asked about college SAT and ACT testing requirements and discussion followed. President Thomas asked about PLC collaboration between the high school and lower grades and examples were provided. President Thomas commented on the way a single campus lends itself to collaboration and continuity between buildings. Dr. Granger described this year's PLC launch and the competitive efforts between them to be the best.
