the WIAA and a plan for sports seasons developed by the WIAA. Mike explained several factors
that could impact practices and games based on these recent guidelines.

5. Finance

The Board reviewed information on the budget for November containing a summary of financial
status, enrollment general fund comparative, and revenues and budgeting. Jim Frey informed
the Board about projections and how they will anticipate enrollment numbers that will affect
the 2021-2022 budget as well as legislative decisions that are made.
6. Reports
Superintendent
• Health Department Updates
Jim Frey reported on the latest information from the Whatcom County Health Department
(WCHD) to continue in-person learning and community health related items. The most recent
information coming from Washington State Department of Health was pertaining to the
performing arts activities being able to engage in-person with given protocols. Jim explained
the process that Tim Metz and principals operate in cooperation with Whatcom County Health
Department if there is a report of a positive COVID-19 case.

Enrollment
Jim Frey explained the steps of developing the 2021-2022 budget, with the first step of
establishing an enrollment projection. With the impact of COVID-19 to in-person learning and
cohort size at each grade level, these factors affecting enrollment and staff to student ratio are
yet to be foreseen, making the projection more challenging. Jim shared thoughts on how they
will go about establishing enrollment numbers for 2021-2022.

7. Adjourn Meeting to go into Board Work Session
Meeting adjourned at 7:50 P.M.
8b. Board Work Session
• Open Public Meetings Act (OPMA) Exemptions
The Board discussed the recent proclamation extension of the OPMA by Governor Jay Inslee
which issues to extend the statutory waivers and suspension until the termination of the state
of emergency or until rescinded, whichever occurs first. We have operated throughout the
COVID-19 Pandemic by meeting remotely and providing community members to attend via
phone with the option to provide written comments and questions to the Board prior to or after
the meeting, therefore meeting requirements of the OPMA guidelines. The Board discussed the
option of changing the current practice to one that would allow community members to speak
at the meeting during the public comment portion. The Board agreed to modify the Public
Comment on the Agenda to allow people to sign-up to speak by notifying the District Office 24
hours in advance and be sent a link to join the audio and video option during that time and
given 5 minutes to address the Board of Directors.
