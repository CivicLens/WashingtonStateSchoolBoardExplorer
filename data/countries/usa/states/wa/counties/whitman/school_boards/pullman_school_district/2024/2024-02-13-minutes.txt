  Community Development Director RJ Lott explained the West End Villas Planned Residential Development is a proposal to divide approximately 5.26 acres into 65 lots.  The PRD includes the construction of 60 townhouses, four lots for open space, and one lot for a private road.  The site for the project is north of Pullman High School, located south of NW High Point Court, and east of NW Valley View Drive on Military Hill. 
  The current zoning designation at this location is R-2 Low-Density Multi-Family Residential.  The R-2 zoning district allows for a maximum density of 15 units per acre.
A planned residential development allows for flexibility and creativity in the layout and design of new residential developments.
  The Planned Residential Development went through the site plan committee on May 30, 2023, and had 45 recommended conditions outlined in the staff report.
  The Planning Commission held a public hearing on this item on June 28, 2023, and voted unanimously in favor of a recommendation of approval to the City Council.  At the public hearing on June 28, 2023, numerous individuals spoke against the proposal.  They cited traffic, parking, and neighborhood character as their chief concerns.  
  This proposal appeared before the City Council on July 11, 2023.  The City Council remanded the item back to staff with the direction that the applicant prepare and submit a traffic impact analysis regarding potential impacts associated with this project proposal.  
  The traffic impact analysis was received on December 15, 2023.  A review of the analysis by staff from the Public Works Department concluded that there is no significant impact on traffic.
  RESOLUTION NO. R-10-24 - A RESOLUTION APPROVING THE WEST END VILLAS PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT PRELIMINARY PLAN.

    Regular Agenda, Action, Resolution, Motion: 3.  
  City Administrator Mike Urban stated Resolution No. R-12-24 will authorize a professional services agreement with Welch Comer for the Downtown Pullman Improvement Project phase three.  The contract with Apollo was awarded on February 6, 2024.  Phase three is part of the original RFP.  The City Council selected Welch Comer from four proposals in October 2021.    Phase zero was the original surveying piece. Having Welch Comer do construction management on this project is vital to ensure the contractor maintains timelines.  The City Staff's ability to perform this work and keep other projects moving is not feasible; we need professional help.   
  Welch Comer Engineer Matt Gillis explained the generalities of the construction phase services agreement and how they will help through the construction process.  The City has contractual ties with Apollo, Inc. as the contractor, and the City will have a separate contract with Welch Comer as the project engineer.  There is no contractual tie between the contractor and the engineer.  Welch Comer has an unbiased, unconnected relationship with the contractor because they represent the City of Pullman.
  Welch Comer's priority is the public's health, welfare, and safety.  Welch Comer is responsible for informing the public about what is happening with the project and is also tasked with enforcing the contract between Apollo and the City of Pullman.  Enforcing that document, Welch Comer is ensuring that the construction of Main Street is done according to the contract documents, the plans, the specifications, and all the associated requirements.
  Matt explained he will serve the City as the overall project manager from the engineering side, and his team has a specific level of expertise that's very important to the project.
  Welch Comer has technical staff and engineers, as technical things will come up during this project that must be addressed immediately.  As important as the technical and administrative services are with the project, Welch Comer must keep very close tabs on pay requests, change orders, and funding, which is the project administrator's job.  One of the most critical jobs on site is the Resident Project Representative, who will be on-site every day the contractors are on site, watching every move they make, documenting everything they do, and ensuring that it's being done per the contract.
  The Welch Comer Focused Public Outreach Coordinator will handle news releases, website updates, weekly newsletters, and outreach to specific business people.  The Public Outreach Coordinator will interact daily with the on-site representative so that they know what the other is doing because they both must know the project's status.
  The Project's Broad Public Outreach Coordinator, Recraft, is an independent consultant who does not promote the City of Pullman, the Project Downtown Pullman, or Welch Comer.  The Project's Broad Public Outreach Coordinator and his staff will work with the Focused Public Outreach Coordinator to inform the public via photography, social media,  and videography of the project site and social media content production throughout the project. 
  Matt explained Welch Comer would host a neighborhood open house meeting in the next couple of weeks where his team and the contractor could answer the public's questions.  Welch Comer will also host a workshop for Pullman businesses to talk with the design team and ask questions about the project's design.
  RESOLUTION NO. R-12-24 - A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE EXECUTION OF A PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF PULLMAN AND WELCH-COMER ENGINEERS FOR THE DOWNTOWN PULLMAN PROJECT PHASE 3 – CONSTRUCTION PHASE SERVICES.
  Motion by Pat Wright, second by Ann Parks.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Nathan Weller, Pat Wright, Megan Guido, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira, Trymaine Gaither
O. Discussion Items
  Discussion Items: 1.  
  Mayor Benjamin explained this agenda item is a follow-up from the council retreat held
on February 3 and is in preparation for the goal setting.  The Council discussed their interest in having a pubic input session before the goal setting that would allow in-person conversations and online suggestions for goal setting.
  The Council unanimously agreed to have a special meeting on Tuesday, March
5, 2024, at 6:00 p.m., each Councilmember will sit at a table to facilitate conversations with the public and answer questions.  The Council agreed to have their Goal Setting Retreat on a Saturday morning after the public input special meeting.  The Council agreed on the below table assignments.
