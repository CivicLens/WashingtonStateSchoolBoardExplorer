F195 / 2024-2025 Budget - The public hearing is to adopt the budget for our school district while ensuring the 2024-25 fiscal year with the review and adoption of the F195 and Resolutions No 2024-17 adoption of the 2024-2025 SY budget. Superintendent, Director of Finance, Human Resources, and Operations David Cram presented a PPT which is available in BoardDocs.
  President Deyo opened the public hearing to receive comments on the 2024-2025 budget at 7:02 pm.
  Resident Dan O'Donnell, who resides at 328 North 3rd Street, La Conner asked the board about his budget concerns with the lack of contributions by the Swinomish Tribe to pay for our current debt service when our school population has 34%
Native American students? Superintendent, Director of Finance, Human Resources, and Operations Cram will meet with Dan O’Donnell to address his concerns.
Superintendent, Director of Finance, Human Resources, and Operations, Dave Cram, stated that although the district had to make significant and difficult staffing and program reductions due to reduced student enrollment, we are on track to close the year out with a positive balance of approximately $511,000. He is optimistic that our district will meet the required 3 to 4% fund balance target and get out of binding conditions.

Superintendent, Director of Finance, Human Resources, and Operations David Cram presented the following budget information.
In June, our enrollment count was reported to OSPI at 486.15 which indicates a downward trend. This decrease is largely due to the shift between the incoming kindergarten class and the outgoing senior class. We initially projected 25 full-time equivalent (FTE) students for kindergarten, but we currently have around 30 to 31 students enrolled, and this number may increase by the time we start the school year. This is a positive development compared to our budgeted estimate of 25. Enrollment figures are crucial as they drive our revenue and staffing models. For the next year, we anticipate receiving around $12,068 per full-time equivalent (FTE) for the Basic Education Allocation (BEA).
  David Cram, Director of Finance, Human Resources, and Operations, provided a 10-year comparison of district finances. Notably, our expenditures for the 2023-24 year are projected at $12.9 million, with revenues expected slightly over $13 million. In the 2021-22 year, revenues peaked at $15.3 million and expenditures were just under $15 million, partly due to ESSER funding related to COVID-19.
A pie chart presented illustrates our revenue sources, with 43% coming from apportionment (state funding). Enrollment significantly impacts this revenue stream. Despite a decrease in enrollment, the state has increased funding through adjustments like the inflation adjustment (COLA/IPD), maintaining a 1% increase crucial for supporting our mature staff. Additionally, there was an increase in funding for materials, supplies, and operating costs (MSOCs), which has been factored into the $12,068 allocation.
  Despite these adjustments, rising costs for employee benefits, insurance, and purchase services—an increase of $265,000—exceed the compensation provided per student. It's worth mentioning that the state funding per FTE does not cover the full cost of employing a teacher in our district, so we rely on local and other funds to cover these additional costs.
Slide 9 of the PPT is state-mandated that districts disclose MSOC funds and 4-year projections after the McCleary Act. The district has to show the MSOC funds are not used for salary increases and are used appropriately, which we are. It isn’t just student enrollment that affects school district budgets. Districts had to address the McLeary Act requiring large salary increases for certificated staff which was only partially funded for two years. Then salaries for classified staff had to be addressed along with inflation rates.
  Director Agen stated the state is supposed to fully fund education which isn’t happening. Our voted debt is through 2032 for the building of the middle school.
Superintendent David Cram highlighted the significant sacrifices made to reach our current position. The district has had to make tough decisions and painful cuts. Upon his arrival, the district office had 6 full-time staff, but now we only have 2.5 employees, with Beth Mills at 0.5 and Beth Clothier and himself each at 1. This reduction has necessitated the remaining staff to cover 6300 hours. We are running on thin resources and need to continue until we have 10% in reserves to comply with policy.
  We are urging officials from Shelter Bay and the Swinomish Tribe to reach an agreement and proceed with their lease. Our student population has declined significantly, for example, we used to have two busloads of kids from Shelter Bay, but this last year we only had 15 students. Families are unable to secure a 30-year loan for a home in Shelter Bay, which has contributed to the decline in student numbers.
The board of directors expressed their gratitude to Superintendent David Cram, Director of Finance, Human Resources, and Operations Dave Cram for his hard work in addressing the financial challenges the district faced when he started. As a result, our district is now closing the year with a positive fund balance.

There being no other comments, President Deyo closed the public hearing on the 2024-2025 budget at 7:42 pm
