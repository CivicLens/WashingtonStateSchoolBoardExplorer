a Public Safety Distributed Antenna System (DAS) for Battle Ground High School, Daybreak Middle School, Daybreak Primary
School and Chief Middle School. The District advertised in both the Washington and Oregon Daily Journal of Commerce
newspapers during December 2023, as well as on the District and the WA State Office of Minority & Womens Business
Enterprise (OMWBE) webpages.Twenty vendors requested the bid packet. Three bidders submitted qualifications. A committee

Executive Director of Human Resources
Background:
We have recently changed our practice in how we conduct background checks of volunteers who have regularly scheduled
unsupervised access to children. Volunteers will undergo a background check through the Washington State Patrol criminal
identification system and through the Federal Bureau of Investigation, instead of through the Secure Volunteer Background
Investigations Bureau (BIB). This will allow us to consider background information beyond seven years.

Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors approve the revision of Policy
5410 Holidays.

Public Content
Presenter:
MichelleReinhardt
Executive Director of Human Resources
Background:
In 2021, the Legislature passed House Bill (HB) 1016 making Juneteenth a state legal holiday in Washington. This change took
effect in June 2022. Policy 5410 Holidays has been updated to include this holiday. Other changes to the policy include
presenting the holidays in a listed format and removing language around additional dates that are considered holidays for district
employees only. These additional dates are outlined in various collective bargaining agreements with the District. These contract
provisions still remain in effect, but are removed from the policy due to not being considered state legal holidays.
