It's the job of the superintendent, who represents the board, and the district staff to carry out the board's wishes. The board welcomes and encourages public participation during its meetings. Members believe that good schools and the community nourish each other and that active citizen interest guarantees the excellence of public schools. Board meetings begin at 5:30pm at the district's Administrative Service Center ( 13413 NE LeRoy Hagen Memorial Drive). All meetings are open to the public (with the exception of executive sessions). At each regular or special meeting , the public can participate in one of two ways: The board asks for public comments to permit audience members to raise district issues not listed on the agenda. However, board members will only be able to listen and/or ask clarifying questions. They will not respond or take action on items not on the published agenda. Or, at regular or special meetings, you can speak regarding any information or action item on the agenda, at the time that item is discussed. You can email the Board of Directors at board.directors@evergreenps.org or contact them at their individual numbers that are listed below. Board Meetings PUBLIC TESTIMONY PROTOCOLS espa ol | p The Board of Directors of Evergreen Public Schools welcomes the public to all open board meetings.
