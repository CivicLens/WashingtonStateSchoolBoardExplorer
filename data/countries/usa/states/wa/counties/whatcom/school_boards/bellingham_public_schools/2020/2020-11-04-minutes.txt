Superintendent’s Announcements and Report:
Over 500 kindergarten students, along with primary students in the Life Skills and
BRIDGES programs, were welcomed into school buildings on Monday. Dr. Baker gave
an update on the number of kindergarten students participating in the in-person, remote,
Bellingham Family Partnership Program and Bellingham Virtual Learning options.
The high school internet cafes have been going well, and we expect to offer this option to
more students soon.
High school athletes are beginning to be brought back for small group outdoor workouts,
one to two days per week while wearing masks. Some workouts will move indoors in the
coming weeks.
The Whatcom County Health Department continues to monitor and inform us, and if their
guidance changes we will adjust accordingly.
First grade students, as well as intermediate Life Skills and BRIDGES students, will
begin to return to in-person classes on Nov. 12. Staff is also working on plans to bring
additional students who receive special education services back to in-person learning.
Dr. Baker responded to questions from board members.
