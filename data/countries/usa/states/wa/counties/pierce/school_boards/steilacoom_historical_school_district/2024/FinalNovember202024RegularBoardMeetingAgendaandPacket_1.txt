Who We Are
The Saltar’s Point Elementary
School LEGO and Robotics Club is
comprised of 68 fourth and fifth
grade students this year. These
students are separated into two
different groups.
Our Beginner group is comprised
of students who have been in the
club at our school before. The
Advanced group is mostly fifth
grade students who were in the
club last year.

Packet page 5 of 129

What We Do
LEGO® Education strongly
believes that students learn
best through play—by actively
doing, exploring, and
experimenting. This approach
empowers them to become
creative and engaged life-long
learners, which is essential for
success in their future careers
and lives.

Packet page 6 of 129

What We Do
Through the use of play, we
actively build, explore, and
experiment with several LEGO®
kits in two groups.
Group 1 - Advanced LEGO and
Robotics
Group 2 - Beginner LEGO and
Robotics
The two groups rotate into the
build part and the Robotics part
weekly.

Packet page 7 of 129

• During this part, students

build various objects or
devices with set parameters
and guidelines using LEGO

BUILD

pieces.
• Students work in groups of
3 to problem solve so as to
find solutions to the confines

of the parameters given.
Packet page 8 of 129

During the Build Phase, students are asked to create
certain objects or devices with various parameters such
as: time, amount of LEGO® bricks, themed builds, and

much more.
Packet page 9 of 129

ROBOTICS

• During this part, students will
use the Spike Prime Kits to

program robotic components
to perform certain tasks.

• The students will work as a
team to program their robotic

components to perform
various tasks using the Spike

Prime App on Chromebooks.

Packet page 10 of 129

This club could not have been
successful without the

generosity of the DoDEA

THANKS

grant which provided all of
our LEGO Spike Prime kits
and from the generous
donation of the PTA to

provide more LEGOs.

To:

Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

From: Shawn Lewis
Subject: Financial Update
Attached are the Budget Status Reports for all funds as of the end of September 2024, along
with charts and data showing our monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund
cash balance.
October expenditures, revenue, and fund balances in all funds are consistent with expectations.
Our fund balance at the end of October was roughly $6.15 million. Impact aid collections are
lower than originally predicted but we expect that money to come from the federal
government once a new budget or continuing resolution is passed at the federal level.
Enrollment is tracking slightly higher than expected in November – largely due to Transitional
Kindergarten students which were not included in the original budget.
On October 31, we transferred $2,000,000 of capital projects fund resources to the debt service
fund. On that same day, Pierce County paid off all outstanding debt and interest related to the
McNeil Street property.
There is currently $1 million in our Capital Projects fund, $870,000 in our Debt Service fund,
$386,000 in our ASB fund, and $176,500 in our Transportation Vehicle fund.
Thank you for the opportunity to assist you in rebuilding the district’s financial health.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF DIRECTORS
Board Meeting Date: November 20, 2024
Strategic Focus Area
☐ Achieve
☒ Support

☐ Connect
☒ Plan
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The 2023-24 Financial Statements have been certified by the Superintendent and the total ending
fund balances for last year were as follows:
General Fund:
ASB Fund:
Debt Service Fund:
Transportation Vehicle Fund:
Capital Projects Fund:

$ 3,950,328.86
$ 337,187.10
$ 2,411,647.09
$ 175,411.66
$ 843,060.40

Our General Fund Balance remains lower than pre-pandemic levels (when the General Fund
Balance was typically closer to $5 million), but we completed the year with a balance above the
Minimum Fund Balance Policy amount.
We also completed the year with a clear plan for paying off all non-voted bonds by October 31.
The district spent below the appropriation level established by the board in every fund.
No adjustment to the current year budget is required but the Superintendent and Board may
consider a future budget extension to restate beginning fund balance amounts and come into
technical compliance with the board’s minimum fund balance policy. This is only recommended if
other adjustments become necessary later in the year.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

No action is required

Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent

II. COMMUNITY PARTNER RECOGNITION
Emily Hofbauer, the district's Health Services Coordinator, shared that SHSD's Health Services
Department reached out to our PTAs and the Sentinel Booster Club, to request assistance with
restocking the supply of spare clothing kept in each health room. Students of all grade levels seek
spare clean clothing at school for various reasons, including incontinence episodes, cafeteria
mishaps, unexpected menstrual cycles, and heavy rain. The goal was to restock dwindling spare
clothing supply as well as optimize the types of clothing we keep in the health room, with a focus on
options that are gender-neutral, weather appropriate, and size inclusive.
The district received an awesome response to the request for help from Saltar's Point and Pioneer
PTA treasurer Lauren Peterson. Lauren put requests out to the community, collected clothing from
donors, washed and sorted many of the donations, and delivered them to the district office for
distribution. The donations received through Lauren helped restock the spare clothing supplies for all
5 mainland schools.
The district also received a wonderful response from the Sentinel's Booster Club. Treasurer Kerry
Campbell brought our request for help to their general membership meeting, where she was able to
secure donations of socks and underwear, to fill the gaps in what the high school health room still
needed.
The district would like to thank Lauren Peterson of the Saltar's Point and Pioneer PTAs, as well as
Kerry Campbell and the members of the Sentinel Booster Club, for helping our health rooms serve
our students.

Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

B. Budget Status Report
Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent, shared budget status reports for all funds as of the end of
September 2024, along with charts and data showing monthly attendance, general fund balance, and
general fund cash balance.
Books for the 2023‐24 school year are substantially complete. The district finished the last fiscal year
with a general fund ending total fund balance of $3.95 million and an unreserved/unassigned fund
balance of $3.25 million. This amount slightly exceeded the board policy minimum fund balance
percentage.
September expenditures are largely in line with expectations. Expenditures this year are higher than
last year primarily due to paying property insurance bill ($375,000) in September ‐ one month earlier
than last year. The district also had $300,000 of prepaid expenses that are already part of the
reserved fund balance.
Revenues were slightly under last year due to decreased enrollment and a delay in making certain
grant claims. The district will be watching revenue trends closely.
Running Start enrollment is less than 1 FTE different than projected. The district budgeted 200 FTE
and October enrollment is currently reported at 200.75 FTE. Non‐Running Start enrollment is
trending slightly over projections which would be recognized as additional revenue in January if the
trend holds (approximately $230,000).
All other funds have expenditures, revenues and balances that are consistent with expectations.
Director Tinsley asked if the factors playing into low enrollment are still the same. Mr. Lewis
confirmed that to be true. He shared information about possible delays in the future residential
development in DuPont.
Director Rohrer shared regarding a TNT article about larger school districts experiencing lower
enrollment. Areas with affordable housing are experiencing some increases in enrollment.
C. Traffic Study Recommendations
Mr. Lewis shared results of traffic studies for elementary schools in the district. The studies and
future improvements are funded by the Capital Projects Levy. Each review included a school
overview, existing conditions, alternatives to consider, and a summary. This year will be a planning

year and a proposal will be brought to the board later this year for any possible work to be done in
the summer.
Director Rohrer asked if any school was a priority. Mr. Lewis shared he would like to make some
improvements at all schools. The process will start with Mr. Lewis meeting with the Town of
Steilacoom and the City of DuPont. The mostly likely success for the least amount of money spent
would be at Saltar's Point. Improving walker/bike rider access for Cherrydale is a top priority for that
school.
Director Tinsley shared some ideas for both Saltar's Point and Cherrydale.
Chair Scott shared there are some safety concerns in Steilacoom for walkers/bike riders that need to
be addressed with the Town.
D. AP Exam Scores
Tracy Garza, Steilacoom High School Assistant Principal, shared AP Exam Data for SHS for the
2023-24 school year. SHS offered 21 AP classes in the 2023-24 school year, with 247 students
taking an AP class. 229 students took a total of 368 AP exams, with 76% of total AP students
earning a score of 3 or higher. Steilacoom High School was named to the 2024 AP School Honor Roll,
earning silver distinction.
V. CONSENT AGENDA
Director Lewis made a motion to approve the Consent Agenda, Director Tinsley seconded the
motion, and the motion passed (4/0).
The Consent Agenda consisted of Approval of September and October 2024 Accounts Payable and
September 2024 Payroll; Approval of the September 18, 2024 Regular Board Meeting Minutes;
Approval of Personnel Reports; Approval of 2024 Instructional Materials Committee; an Approval of
SHS Field Trip Request to National Cheerleading Championships.
VI. NEW BUSINESS
A. Approval of School Improvement Plans
Dr. Laurie Valleries shared district 2023-2026 Continuous School Improvement Plans (CSIP) were
adopted on October 18, 2023, and through the district's monitoring process, school teams have
completed a thorough review and analysis of multiple data points, including the spring Washington
School Improvement Framework (WSIF) and Smarter Balanced (SBA) data. This process led to an
update and revision of school goals, ensuring they reflect the most recent data. School teams have
developed new action steps to replace those that were successfully completed in the 23-24 school
year, and they are excited to continue making progress toward achieving these goals.
Each Continuous School Improvement Plan continues to serve as a central hub for school data,
outlining clear, measurable objectives for student outcomes and detailing the collaborative efforts
required to achieve them. The CSIPs provide families and community members with a transparent
view of the schools' commitment to continuous improvement, fostering a shared understanding of
our long-term goals.
Schools designated as Title I or identified under the Washington School Improvement Framework
(WSIF) have conducted comprehensive needs assessments, as required. The results of these

assessments were shared during a Board Briefing in the fall of 2024 and have played a key role in
shaping the updated goals and action steps in their respective plans.
Each plan is designed with three focused goals, supported by actionable steps that can be completed
within the school year. As steps are accomplished, they will be replaced with new actions to ensure
ongoing progress until the overarching goals are met.
Director Rohrer made a motion to reaffirm approval of the updated 2024-2026 School Improvement
Plans for all six district schools, Director Tinsley seconded the motion, and the motion passed (4/0).
B. Board Goal - Professional Learning
Chair Scott shared an article about budgets and explaining why Washington school budgets are
getting tighter, and what can be done about it. He thanked Mr. Lewis and the district for the hard
work already done to correct the budget, so our district has not had to go through the terribly
difficult times other districts have. He encouraged other directors to read the article.
VII. BOARD COMMUNICATION
No communication was received by directors.
VIII. ANNOUNCEMENTS
Director Tinsley shared it is fundraising season for district PTAs.
IX. ADJOURNMENT
Director Tinsley made a motion to adjourn the meeting at 7:19 p.m., Director Rohrer seconded the
motion, and the motion passed (5/0).

II. COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE
No comments.
III. NEW BUSINESS - Sanitary Sewer Easement on McNeil Street Property
Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent, shared that as part of the masterplan development
approval process, the District and Careage worked together to ensure the District’s property on
McNeil Street has access to stormwater retention areas located on other parcels, and adjacent
property owners would have reasonable access to necessary utility services. Careage is closing on an
adjacent parcel and the new owner would like the easement for sanitary sewer approved prior to
the sale. This easement is for a sanitary sewer line that extends through what will be the future
elementary school playfield and a portion of the parking lot. The easement is to the County and
would require the District to seek approval for any construction that would interfere with the
County’s access to the easement area. The placement of the line was reviewed by the engineer and
architect firms the District worked with during the conceptual design phase for the elementary
school. It was determined that the placement would not impact the District’s future construction or
sitework.
Questions and discussion followed, with Chair Scott summarizing there is no downside to the district
in approving this agreement. The district loses no property, as it does not have to use its property
for the stormwater retention pond.
Director Lewis made a motion to approve the McNeil Street property sanitary sewer easement to
Pierce County and authorize the Superintendent to sign all necessary documents to allow for the
recording of the easement, Director Tinsley seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Senate Bill 5395 requires that every public school shall provide comprehensive sexual
health education (CSHE) to each student by the 2022-23 school year. This board
background outlines the update of the Comprehensive Sexual Health Education (CSHE)
curriculum for 5th grade in alignment with state requirements and CSHE educational
standards.
Legal Requirements and Rationale for Curriculum Selection:
Washington State law mandates that all public schools provide comprehensive sexual
health education (CSHE) that is medically and scientifically accurate, age-appropriate,
inclusive, and effective in promoting healthy relationships. Key requirements include:
1. Medically and Scientifically Accurate: Information must be verified and supported by
research in the field of sexual health.
2. Age-Appropriate: The curriculum must match the developmental stage and cognitive
ability of students.
3. Inclusive: Education must be respectful of all students regardless of gender, race,
disability status, or sexual orientation.
4. Standards-Aligned: The curriculum must meet specific grade-level standards as
outlined by the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI).
5. Per the RCW, SHSD must provide access to CSHE:
a) At least once in grades 4-5. SHSD has determined it will provide access to
CSHE in the 5th grade.
The selected curricula, Marsh Media for 5th grade meet these requirements for the
following reasons:
1. Pre-Vetted by OSPI: The curricula have been rigorously evaluated and approved by the
Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), ensuring that they meet or exceed all
state standards for CSHE.
2. Transparency and Accessibility: SHSD can post the videos two weeks prior on the
district website and provide families with a password for access, providing full public
transparency and ensuring that there are no copyright issues that would prevent public
access.
Packet page 123 of 129

3. Compliance with New RCW: Updating the curricula will bring SHSD into compliance
with the latest state laws regarding CSHE.
Grade-Specific Implementation:
5th Grade (Marsh Media Curriculum): This updated curriculum offers a comprehensive
introduction to puberty for younger students, tailored to both girls and boys. Each version
incorporates new music and a fresh perspective on the changes associated with puberty.
Designed for students who are not yet ready to learn about reproduction, the curriculum
focuses on body changes, hygiene, and emotional well-being.
●
●
●
●
●

Anticipating the onset of puberty
Understanding physical and emotional changes
Learning about menstruation
Emphasizing the importance of hygiene, exercise, nutrition, and sleep
Building self-esteem and positive body image

This curriculum provides age-appropriate information to prepare students for the changes
ahead while promoting positive body awareness and self-care practices.
The "AIDS: Facts for Kids" program provides clear, age-appropriate information to help
students understand HIV and AIDS. The core message is: "Protecting yourself from HIV
and AIDS is your own responsibility." This curriculum aims to dispel myths and focus on
practical information for making healthy choices.
Key elements include:
● Understanding HIV: Students learn how HIV affects the immune system and why
it’s important to protect their health.
● Transmission Facts: The program explains that HIV is not spread through casual
contact, such as sneezing, sharing a water fountain, or using the same telephone. It
is primarily transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person or exposure
to infected blood.
● Prevention Tips: Students receive practical advice on how to stay healthy, including
avoiding illegal drugs and being careful with activities that could involve blood, like
ear piercing.
The program offers reassuring guidance to help students make informed and safe
decisions, promoting a positive approach to personal health.
Evaluation and Selection Process:
During the 2023-2024 school year, a comprehensive evaluation process was led by Mary
Snyder in collaboration with the 5th grade team. The process involved:
● Review of Current Curriculum: The team conducted a thorough review of the
existing sexual health education curriculum to identify gaps and areas for
improvement.
● Research and Comparison: Various curricula were researched and compared
against the Comprehensive Sexual Health Education (CSHE) requirements and
standards set by the state. The 5th grade team recommended the FLASH
curriculum to the IMC.

Packet page 124 of 129

● District Office Review: The District Office reviewed FLASH and determined that
some materials were not age appropriate, took away too much instructional time,
and exceeded the standards requirements. Therefore, the District Office decided to
research and compare updated versions of existing curricula and present them to
the Instructional Materials Committee (IMC) for approval, as they meet current Office
of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) standards.
● Selection of Approved Curriculum: The decision was made to update the current
curriculum with materials pre-approved by OSPI to ensure they meet all necessary
standards and requirements.
● Instructional Materials Committee (IMC) Review: The IMC reviewed the District’s
request to update the 5th grade curriculum and agreed that it met the minimum state
requirements. The IMC is requesting approval for the following updates and
adoption:
○ Just Around the Corner (Girls) (Grades 4-6)
○ Just Around the Corner (Boys) (Grades 4-6)
○ AIDS Facts for Kids (Grades 5-8)
Exclusions:
It is important to note that CSHE is not taught in grades TK-4 in SHSD. Instead, our focus
in these early grades is on Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) skills, such as solving
problems with peers,and learning to self-regulate emotions independently. These
foundational SEL skills are crucial for overall student development and help prepare
younger students for more advanced topics in later grades.
The update and adoption of the Marsh Media curriculum for 5th grade provides curricula
that not only meet state requirements but also promote transparency, inclusivity, and
age-appropriate learning. By implementing these updates, SHSD will ensure that our
families are well-informed and can preview all CSHE materials before they are taught on
our district website two weeks prior to the videos being shown.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
The Instructional Materials Committee recommends that the Board:
● Update and adopt the Marsh Media curriculum for the 5th grade
○ Just Around the Corner (Girls) (Grades 4-6)
○ Just Around the Corner (Boys) (Grades 4-6)
○ AIDS Facts for Kids (Grades 5-8)

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
During the 2024 Legislative Session, a new law was passed making it a gross misdemeanor to
enter and remain unlawfully on a school bus and create a risk to the passengers or driver.
This revision to our Transportation policy 6600 incorporates the new law which is intended to
prevent or otherwise deter people from entering a school bus without permission and putting
students and drivers at risk.
In addition to this policy, the district is required to promote awareness of the importance of safety
and security on school buses and (if funds are appropriated) affix placards warning of the
consequences of committing school bus trespass

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

I move approval of policy 6600.

TRANSPORTATION
The district may provide transportation to and from school for a student:
A. Whose residence is beyond the one mile radius from the school to which the student is
assigned;
B. Whose walking route to school is hazardous;
C. Whose disability prevents him/her from walking or providing for his/her own welfare while
walking; or
D. Who has another compelling and legally sufficient reason to receive transportation services.
The parent or guardian of a student whose assigned bus stop is beyond the maximum walking
distance may receive reimbursement for private transportation at the state mileage
reimbursement rate.
At the request of an eligible student, the district may allow the student to transport his or her
infant on a school bus or other student transportation vehicle provided by the district. The infant
must be transported in a rear-facing child restraint system as defined in the federal motor vehicle
safety standards found in 49 C.F.R. § 572.213. If the district denies the student’s request to
transport his or her infant by school bus, the district must authorize other arrangements for
individual transportation in accordance with RCW 28A.160.030. For purposes of this paragraph,
“eligible student” means any student served by the transportation program of the district or
compensated for individual transportation arrangements authorized by RCW 28A.160.030 whose
route stop is outside the walk area for a student’s school, except if the student to be transported is
disabled under RCW 28A.155.020 and is either not ambulatory or not capable of protecting his
or her own welfare while traveling to or from the school or agency where special education
services are provided, in which case no mileage distance restriction applies.
Each year the superintendent or designee will present to the board the number of students who
live within the minimum distance of their schools and for whom there appears sufficient
justification for the district to provide transportation. In this report, the superintendent or
designee will also provide the reasons why each of these students is transported.
The district's transportation program will comply in all ways with state law and regulation.
Transportation services of the district may include approved bus routes, district-approved field
trips, school activities (participants only) and extracurricular activities (rooters). The
superintendent or designee is authorized to permit a parent of a student enrolled in school to ride
a bus when excess seating is available and private or other public transportation is not reasonably
available.
The board of directors may authorize children attending an approved private school to ride a
school bus provided that the bus route and stops are not altered, space is available, and a fee to
cover the per seat cost for such transportation is collected.
Routes And Schedules
The superintendent or designee will be responsible for scheduling bus transportation, including
the determination of routes and bus stops as well as overseeing the transportation program.

Page 1 of 3
Packet page 127 of 129

Policy No. 6600
Management Support
The purpose of bus scheduling and routing is to achieve maximum service with a minimum fleet
of buses insofar as this is consistent with rendering safe and reasonably equal service to all
students entitled to such service. The board may authorize the use of a district-owned passenger
car in lieu of a bus for transporting students to and from school.
In order to operate the transportation system as safely and efficiently as possible, the following
factors will be considered in establishing bus routes:
A.Where an alternate route may be considered without sacrifice of efficiency or economy,
preference will be given to that route more directly serving the largest number of
students;
B. Location of bus stops may be determined by such factors as student safety, economy and
efficiency. Students may be required to walk up to one mile from their home to their bus
stop provided that the walking route is safe; and
C. School schedules will be adjusted to allow maximum utilization of each bus in the system
by alternating elementary and secondary trips.
The district will apply for state transportation apportionment funds and will maintain the records
required to obtain such funding.
Emergency Routes And Schedules
The district will develop emergency bus routes and schedules to be used when weather
conditions make the usual routes impassable or, in the superintendent's or designee’s judgment,
too hazardous. At the beginning of the school year, copies of emergency routes and schedules
will be distributed to parents with instructions on how to obtain emergency information.
If roads are closed to buses but not to private vehicles, the district may continue to operate the
instructional programs of the schools without providing bus transportation until the roads are
again open to buses.
School Bus Trespass
It is a gross misdemeanor for individuals to enter or remain unlawfully on a school bus, do any
act that creates a substantial risk of harm to passengers or the driver, and cause a substantial
interruption or impairment of services rendered by the bus. This doesn’t apply to enrolled
students, law enforcement officers or other authorized personnel engaged in the performance of
their official duties, individuals with written consent from the district allowing them to enter or
remain on the school bus, and emergency situations where entering the bus is necessary to
protect the safety or wellbeing of students or others.
The district will implement educational programs and awareness campaigns to inform students,
parents, and the community about the importance of maintaining safety and security on school
buses. These initiatives will highlight the potential criminal consequences of school bus
trespassing.
If the district receives the funds to do so, it will affix placards warning of the consequences of
school bus trespassing to the outside of all its school buses so they are easily visible.
