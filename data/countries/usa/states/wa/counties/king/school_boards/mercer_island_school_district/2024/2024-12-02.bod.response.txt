Many school districts and other agencies have such policies to assist when deciding whether and how to name a new facility, name an existing facility/portion of a facility, or rename a facility/portion of a facility. The District wishes to invite interested people with either a previous or current connection to Mercer Island to apply to be a member of our Facility Naming Policy Committee. The Board selected two current School Board members, Maggie Tai Tucker and Dan Glowitz, to work alongside the Superintendent to begin the process of selecting a representative group to serve on the Facility Naming Policy Committee. The superintendent is charged with submitting a policy recommendation to the current Mercer Island School Board for consideration. If you are interested in this opportunity, please complete this brief survey . We also encourage you to share this survey with other current or former Islanders who you think might be interested. The survey will close on Friday, October 18. If you have any questions, please contact communications@mercerislandschools.org .
