Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer, Director of Capital Projects

Explanation of Issue:

One of the requirements for obtaining state construction funding assistance associated withthe
replacement of Parkview Elementary School, the school board must approve the Educational
Specifications associated with the new school.
During the winter and spring of 2019-2020, the Sunnyland Elementary School Educational Specifications
/Design Advisory Committee, which comprises staff members, parents, community members, and
consultants, met to develop the educational specifications for our new Parkview Elementary School. Amy
Berreth, Sunnyland principal,and Curtis Lawyer led this effort with support from Zach Ham from Dykeman
Architects.
The Educational Specifications (Ed. Specs.) are a compilation of written narratives intended to describe
the activities and physical/spatial requirements of the new school. Their purpose is to provide a written
document that communicates to the architects the goals and requirements of the new school. Further, the
Ed. Specs. define the functions, relationships, valuesand goals that the design must respond to.
The process involves identifying and describing specific physical needs and other considerations for the
various programs which will take place in the school. These considerations include the number and type
of occupants, size, lighting, plumbing, HVAC, power, data/voice, finishes (floors, walls, ceiling)and
specialties such as casework, whiteboards, projection screens, the use of technologyand proximity
/adjacency requirements.
Attached for board approval is Resolution 20-20 which certifies the school boards approval of the
Sunnyland Elementary School Educational Specifications.
A copy of the entire document is also attached.

2.8 Authorize Negotiations for General ContractorConstruction Manager Services Related to Sunnyland
Rebuild

Meeting :

Sep 16, 2020 - Regular Board Meeting via Zoom

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the request outlined below in connection with
the new Sunnyland Elementary School project. As
superintendent, I have reviewed this information and fully
support the proposal to move forward with contract
negotiations with Dawson Construction to provide GC/CM
services for this project.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer, Director of Capital Projects
Explanation of Issue:
With any school rebuild project we strive to keep students and staff on site while construction occurs, and with an occupied site, safety is the
greatest concern. Sunnyland Elementary is one of our smallest school sites and safety during construction is especially highlighted for this
project. In working with our consultants to develop mitigations of this risk, we decided to seek approval to utilize the General Contractor
Construction Manager (GC/CM) project delivery model for the new Sunnyland Elementary rebuild project. On June 25, 2020, the Capital
Projects Review Boards Project Review Committee formally authorized us to utilize the GC/CM process.
The primary advantage with GC/CM is that the contractor is hired early on as a partner and provides valuable input and recommendations
during design including facility design, siting, phasing, material selection, scheduling, procurement, etc., which is not the case with Design/Bid
/Build. In addition, the GC/CM contractor selection process is based on qualifications and fee rather than solely on fee.
On June 26, 2020, we publicly advertised a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) from firms interested in providing GC/CM services for the
Sunnyland Project. Six firms responded by providing Statements of Qualifications (SOQ):Abbott-RAM Construction, BNBuilders, Colacurcio
Brothers, Dawson Construction, FORMA and SpeeWest Construction.
A selection committee comprised of Mike Anderson, Director, Buildings and Grounds; Amy Berreth, Sunnyland Principal; Curtis Lawyer,
Capital Projects Director; Corey Ayers, Capital Projects Manager, and Zach Ham, Associate Principal for Dykeman Architects, reviewed the
SOQs on July 24, 2020, and selected BNBuilders, Dawson and FORMA as the most highly-qualified to continue on in the selection process.
Selected firms were invited to interview with the committeevia Zoom onAugust 10, 2020, and to submit a Request for Fee Proposal (RFFP)
due August 13, 2020. The RFFP requested Contractors fee, specified general conditions (staff costs for management of project)and preconstruction services.
Scoring was weighted as follows: up to 40 points for qualifications (SOQ), up to 40 points for interview performance, and up to 20 points for
Request for Fee Proposal (RFFP).After combining the SOQ, interview andRFFP scores, Dawson Construction earned the highest score of
93.9 points, followed by 93.2 points for BNBuilders and 93.0 points for FORMA. See attached GC/CM Scoring Summary.
Based on the above, board approval is requested to begin contract negotiations with Dawson Construction to provide General Contractor
Construction Manager Services for the new Sunnyland Elementary School Rebuild project.

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached Partial Release of Utility
Easement which, as superintendent, I approve.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer, Director of Capital Projects

Explanation of Issue:

In 1955, the district received the vacated right-of-way of Cornwall Avenue that is now part of the school
property of Parkview Elementary School. With any right-of-way, an easement is established for utility
companies to maintain existing utilities located within the right-of-way. This easement is left in place until
a request is made to relinquish it. Through the district's work to permit the rebuild project for Parkview
Elementary Schoolwith the City of Bellingham, we discovered this easement is still in place. Becausewe
are not able to build on an easement, we have requested that the City extinguish this easement. To do so
in a timely manner, so as not to hold up construction efforts, we are entering into an agreement with the
City that allows us to continue construction and resolve any issues that might arise with local utility
agencies directly. Since this roadway became our property in 1955, and since we have researched
theeasement and contacted the utility franchisees, we are comfortable entering into this agreement.

Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer, Director of Capital Projects

Explanation of Issue:

During the bid period forthe phase 2 fields at Squalicum High School, it became apparent that the cost of
the dugouts was cost-prohibitive and the decision was made to deduct this scope to bid at a later time to
secure better pricing. During construction,district staff worked to revise the scope and bring the price

down for thedugouts. The capital projects team worked with the design team and contractor to negotiate
a price that was approximately one-third of the initial price estimates. The attached change order
represents the costs for all four dugouts.
