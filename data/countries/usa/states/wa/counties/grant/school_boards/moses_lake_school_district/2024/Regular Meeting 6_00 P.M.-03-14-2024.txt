----- Written Comment(s) ----Lanette May--3 years ago the FMS library was split in half to provide for as I was told a temporary classroom. The table and chairs
along with half of book shelving went to the classroom side. Leaving the library with all the Non-Fiction books on tables, with no
where for student to sit. I was told that they would be replacing the tables and chairs in the future (still has not been done). It is
concerning to me that the students at FMS have to take state tests sitting on cushions on the floor and listening to the classroom
next door. I have been trying for 3 years to get replacement shelving units for the books and tables and chairs for the library side of
the room. I am bringing this to the attention of the school board member in hopes that the FMS students and staff can get their
library back and be able to utilize it. As my other attempts going through the FMS principals and the LSC have gone unanswered.
Please advise as to what FMS Library needs to do to get these items so that we may be able to service our students better.
