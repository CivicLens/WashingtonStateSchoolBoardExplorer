  3. Reports
A. Budget Status and Financial Report
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses for the month of June which was a typically slow summer month. Expenses included the twice-yearly interest payment on bond debt. Ending cash and investments continue to trend downward as time passes further away from tax collection months. Revenues and expenditures as compared to budget also show a typical reduction in activity. Unusual items related to the pandemic emergency included refunds received and given for numerous cancellations. This has not been a typical year, and next year will continue to be unusual.
  Director McKinney asked about ASB revenues and Ms. Porter explained that they are made up primarily of fundraising from various sources. There is no tax revenue in the ASB fund, and there is a small amount of interest earned on the fund deposits. The ASB fund also includes some revenue from programs like InvestED, as well as fees collected for athletic participation, yearbooks, etc. It was noted that revenue was received for high sales of yearbooks at the end of the school year. Ms. Porter also referenced refunds that were issued from the ASB account for athletic fees and other programs canceled due to the pandemic. Those refunds are represented in the ASB expenses.
  There was discussion regarding the Interfund Billing amount referenced on page one of the report. Director Thomas asked about the Transportation Vehicle expense referenced in September 2019 and Ms. Porter explained that was for the purchase of a school bus.
  B. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update on current district activities.

During the 2020-2021 program year, board meetings will remain on the 4th Monday of each month, except for December. The designation for a meeting in Pt. Roberts has been removed from the 2020-2021 calendar due to the pandemic, but may be scheduled if circumstances allow. Consideration is being given to moving the annual Point Roberts meeting to September, starting in 2021.

The district's reopening plan represents a large volume of work by the Facilities department in arranging classroom furniture to implement 6-feet of distancing and other measures to limit contact between students and staff. The district is also working on options for a robust online program for families who are not comfortable sending their students to school. This week, families are being asked to choose between hybrid and online models in an attestation survey which opened today. At the time of the meeting, there were over 400 responses with more than 70% choosing the hybrid model. Dr. Granger has also been collaborating with the Boys & Girls Club on an after school care plan using school facility space.

An update was provided on the field turf project which was impacted by rain water and necessitated one section being dug out and redone. The full football field is now installed, and the project is slated for completion in mid-August.

Staffing considerations for next year are underway. Survey responses from families are informing decisions about how many students will be in each classroom. Instead of adding two daytime custodial positions, current nighttime workers are being rescheduled to daytime shifts.
  Implementation of the legislature's Sex Ed bill is on hold pending the results of Referendum 90 which will be on November's General Election ballot. The district will continue with its current curriculum for grades 6-12, but will hold off on adding curriculum for K-5.

Director Lotze asked how teachers have responded to the idea of returning to classrooms. Dr. Granger referenced a few questions that have come up in staff meetings, as well as the WEA's formal statement encouraging the governor to require schools to provide online only instruction. Having enough staff to conduct in-person instruction will be critical to the success of the district's hybrid reopening plan. The situation is being monitored.

Dr. Granger anticipates an upcoming decision from WIAA to pause all sports until January. He shared concerns about giving the message that using gym spaces can be allowed if classroom spaces cannot be used by students. Dr. Granger further described concerns regarding potential impact on student engagement in learning without the motivation of athletic participation. Director Lotze asked about choir and band which also fall under WIAA jurisdiction. Limitations on music instruction are a result of the higher risk due to expenditure of droplets with force of breath for both wind instruments and singing. Dr. Granger referenced Mr. Gray's and Mr. Marshall's work to identify options for music instruction without instruments for the time being. He also mentioned the possibility of playing musical instruments out on the football field where safe distancing can be implemented. President Gibson thanked Dr. Granger and the leadership team for their hard work in this challenging planning process.
  4. Public Hearing
A. Public Hearing on 2020-21 Budget
A Public Hearing was held on the 2020-21 Budget. Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided a high level overview of each fund followed by more detail of the General Fund.
  Ms. Porter described the process for student leaders to set their own ASB budget which is then affirmed by the school board in its budget adoption. Director McKinney asked what sorts of expenses are included in the ASB budget, and Ms. Porter described examples of expenses related to athletics and field trips which correspond with revenue from fundraising and fees. Third party charitable fundraising (e.g. InvestEd) is also permitted through this fund. The proposed ASB budget is based upon a typical school year, and Ms. Porter described unique variables that could impact ASB revenues and expenditures in the 2020-2021 school year. Director Nunamaker asked about revenue from ASB card fees which Ms. Porter indicated are not necessarily a large portion of the revenue total.

Transportation Vehicle Fund revenue can only be used for the purchase of buses and, although the intent is for funds to be used up annually, funds may carry over to allow accumulation for these large purchases.
  The Capital Projects Fund is also budgeted for full expenditure. Unspent funds can be carried over, but must only be spent on capital related expenses. Funds from Capital Projects cannot be transferred to the General Fund to assist with any deficit there.

Ms. Porter reviewed the proposed General Fund budget. She affirmed the continued expectation for maintaining a 6% ending fund balance. The proposed budget is based upon a typical school year. The district anticipates that adjustments will be needed to address changes related to the current pandemic emergency, however expenditures cannot exceed the approved budget amount without board approval. Ms. Porter explained that, because the district's fiscal year will start in a strong position, there is atypical capacity for budget expenditures to exceed revenue. Potential impacts from legislative action were also discussed. Enrollment trends were reviewed, and Ms. Porter reminded the board that the 2016-17 FTE increase was a result of implementing full-time kindergarten and did not indicate a significant increase in student count. Ms. Porter explained factors which impacted reduction of the budgeted enrollment for 2020-21. There was a modest 4% increase in expenditures which will include the increase from 11 to 12 months of SEBB benefits coverage. Ms. Porter also described the MSOC Disclosure which is required by law.
  The General Fund Forecast was reviewed showing budgetary expectations for continuing the current level of service. Director McKinney asked about upcoming open contract negotiations which will take place with both BEA and SEIU in the spring of 2021. Ms. Porter explained that the projection is based on the state's expected inflation numbers and does not account for any negotiated salary increases. There was continued discussion regarding other potential budgetary impacts.

The board will take action on approval of the budget at the August 24 meeting. Dr. Granger will continue to lead planning efforts with consideration given to ongoing cost reductions.

At 7:52pm, President Gibson opened the floor to receive public comment. Patrons were instructed to use the Zoom webinar's "Raise Hand" feature to indicate their desire to speak. No attendees indicated a desire to address the board, and President Gibson closed the public comment period at 7:53pm.
