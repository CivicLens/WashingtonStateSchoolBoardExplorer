9. REGULAR MEETING - Consent Agenda
Subject :

A. Budget and Enrollment Reports

Meeting :

Mar 25, 2024 - Board of Directors Study Session and
Regular Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the Budget and Enrollment
Reports as presented

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
February Budget Reports:
Fund balance and net cash: The beginning fund balance for the 2023-24 year was $3.8 million. As of the end of February 2024, the fund
balance was $266,638 (compared to $4.7 million last February 2023) and net cash is approximately $2.5 million (compared to $7 million last
February 2023). These balances have decreased from the previous month and while it is consistent with the normal pattern at this time of
year, it is at a significantly lower balance across this fiscal year than in prior years. Consistent with prior year trends, fund balance, net cash,
and revenues show a large spike in October from receipt of a large portion of local property taxes. December through March show declines
especially since the state apportionment allocation in November is only 5% of the total allocation versus 9% in other months. Fund balance
and net cash will continue to decrease in the coming months as the influx of levy dollars tapers down, until the next big influx in April.
Meanwhile expenditures remain at a fairly consistent monthly level. A short-term temporary interfund loan from the Capital Projects is
planned for the month of March, if needed. A short-term temporary interfund loan from Capital Projects is almost certain to be needed for the
month of June which is typically the lowest point in the year for fund balance.
Local Tax Revenue: The district has received 46% of total budgeted General Fund tax revenues for the 2023-24 fiscal year. Tax revenues
received year-to-date amount to $4.4 million of the $9.6 million budgeted.

State Apportionment Revenues: The district's State Apportionment allocation is increased since actual average full-time equivalent (FTE)
enrollment is approximately 117 more than budgeted enrollment. In November, the District requested OSPI to adjust the enrollment figure
used to disburse the District's monthly allocation, to a level that would more closely align with the increase in enrollment that the district was
experiencing. This allowed the district to receive needed revenues earlier and supported cash flow levels for November and December. The
amount of the increase will be more evident with January's apportionment which is when the State makes its annual 'true-up' on its payments
to school districts. January is when the state adjusts from paying school districts based on budgeted average student FTE to payments
based on ACTUAL average student FTE. The remaining increase in apportionment is than spread from January to August. The overall
increase in revenues for additional enrollment is estimated to be between $1-1.5 million dollars.
March Enrollment Report:
The March 2024 enrollment reports are submitted for Board review and approval. Actual enrollment for March 2024 was 5,419.34 FTE (FullTime-Equivalent). March enrollment decreased 5.10 FTE compared to February's enrollment. The average FTE taking into consideration
September through March monthly enrollments is 5,431.67. This is 117.67 FTE more than budgeted enrollment of 5,314.00.
Compared to 2022-23 average enrollment, the district is serving approximately 69 more student FTE in 2023-24 than the year before.
Previous Board Action:
Board acceptance of Budget Reports for January 2024 occurred at the February 26, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.
February enrollment was approved by the Board during the February 26, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the 2023-24 Highly Capable
Program Grant.

Goals :

Goal 1: Student Learning & Achievement

Public Content
Submitted by:
Karl Olson, Director of Categorical Programs
Background Information:

Board Policy 2190 requires that the Board annually approves the District's Highly Capable Program plan. Additionally, the grant application
requires School Board approval as directed by OSPI. For this year, OSPI is using a new system called "Smart Sheets." This new format is in a
list and checkbox form, thus the reason for the design of the attachment.
Administrative Considerations:

The Highly Capable Program is offered in grades kindergarten through twelfth grade. A continuum of services is offered based on the needs
of the students and their highly capable goals. Funding pays for a 1.0 FTE HiCap Coordinator to oversee all aspects of the K-12 program, as
well as collaboration time for staff and PLC'sto meet and provide guidance on continual improvement efforts.
Professional development for general education staff, extended learning, and materials are all funded from this grant as well.
Budgetary Impact:

State funding for the 2023-24 Highly Capable Program is projected to be $186,757.

Contract as presented and ammended.

Goals :

Goal 1: Student Learning & Achievement

Public Content
Submitted by:
Karl Olson, Director of Categorical Programs

Background Information:
Arlington Public Schools contracts with the Human Services Department of Snohomish County to fund the ECEAP Preschool Program. ECEAP
partners with families to prepare their children for success in kindergarten and beyond. This program provides free preschool to families who
meet financial requirements. This specific contract amendment adds additional funds for the 2023-24 school year in order to continue offsetting
the total cost of the program. We are a sub-recipient of these funds, and they will be utilized to provide additional Assistant Teachers for
classroom support in order to support social-emotional needs of students. This current amendment represents an increase of $7,320 from the
previous contract approved by the Board.

Administrative Considerations:

Research demonstrates the importance of early education. Due to financial constraints, many families are not able to provide a
preschool experience for their children. ECEAP works to strengthen the entire family and provides a positive opportunity for the
pre-kindergarten age students and their families.
Budgetary Impact:

The additional funds of $7,320 are part of the total grant amount of $655,000.

Briefing

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Brian Lewis, Executive Director of Operations
Background Information:
The Asset Preservation Program (APP) is a state required assessment of buildings constructed with state assistance and accepted by
school district Board of Directors after December 31, 1993. Arlington has several of these buildings. The briefing describes these buildings
and theircurrent building assessment scores.
Administrative Considerations:
Most of the district APP buildings meet or exceed the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI)established standards.
Presidents Elementary is the only APP school which does not meet OSPI's standards. This condition will be corrected by the planned
envelope improvements project for the school scheduled for Summer 2025. The envelope improvements project will provide a new roof for
the structure, repair deficient exterior siding, replace any failed windows, and repaint the exterior siding and steel of the building.
Budgetary Impact:
None at this time.At the end of a building's 30-year life span, if the building has not been maintained to OSPI standards, there is the potential
that state construction assistance program funds available to Arlington Public Schools may be reduced.
