Public Content
Information:
Interlocal Cooperation agreement with resident districts for special education services 2024-25
Background:
Edmonds School District places a strong emphasis on serving Deaf and Hard of Hearing students and
providing them with a variety of educational options to accommodate their diverse learning needs. The
utilization of American Sign Language (ASL) - English Bilingual strategies, with strong connections to
evidence-based practices in second language instruction, is an important step in supporting the academic
development of these students and ensuring they have access to quality education.
By offering ASL-English bilingual programming as well as other educational programs that incorporate
various modalities, the District recognizes that each student may have unique preferences and needs
when it comes to academic learning. This inclusive approach allows students to choose the method that
best suits their individual learning styles, maximizing their chances of academic success.
Furthermore, the District's commitment to providing access to education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing
children, both within the District and in partner districts, demonstrates a dedication to ensuring that all
students, regardless of their location, have equal opportunities for education and personal growth. (It's
important to note that while the current agreement with NW School for the Deaf & Hard of Hearing,
inherited from the previous administration, allows for student placement there, the focus for the future will
be on expanding in-district options to better serve our students' needs and preferences).
By fostering an environment that values modality diversity and tailoring educational programs to meet the
needs of different learners, the District is setting a positive example for inclusive education practices. This
approach not only helps students thrive academically but also promotes a sense of belonging and
empowerment among Deaf and Hard of Hearing students, as they are recognized and supported in their
unique educational journey.
There are currently 41 students attending the DHH program via this interlocal agreement and additional
students may be added during the school year. This agreement has been in place for 41 years.

proposal are contained in the attached amendment.
The Budget Authorization request is for $87,000,000 and includes all project costs, including sales tax. Capital Projects will

contract for all necessary project-related construction, FF&E (furniture, fixtures, and equipment), design,
construction administration, permits, special inspections and testing, project management, and other
related services needed for the project (whether by bidding or some other procurement procedure
authorized by Washington State Law) and enter into (and, as necessary, amend) all project-related
contracts within the approved Budget Authorization, all of which will be done in compliance with

Recommended Action :

highest rated firm to provide General Contractor/Construction Manager (GC/CM) Services for the College Place Elementary and College
Place Middle Schools Replacement Project. Approval of preliminary budget for College Place Replacement Project.

Background:
In accordance with RCW 39.10 and the procedures described below, District personnel have determined Cornerstone General Contractors of
Bothell, WA, to be the highest-rated firm to provide General Contractor/Construction Manager (GC/CM) Services for the College Place
Elementary and College Place Middle Schools Replacement Project. If the Board of Directors authorizes award of the contract, the District
would execute the attached agreement and issue a purchase order for $1,496,684 for Conceptual and Preconstruction Services. (See
attached Cornerstone Proposal for Preconstruction Services.) Near the end of the Design phase the District and Cornerstone General
Contractors would negotiate a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for Construction. District staff would bring the GMP proposal to the Board
for consideration. If the Board approved the GMP, it would be executed as an amendment to the contract recommended in this item.
In accordance with State requirements, the District advertised a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to provide GC/CM services. Seven firms
submitted their Statements of Qualifications (SOQ). A seven-person team independently reviewed all SOQs using the ten selection criteria
described in detail in the RFQ, and advanced the following four firms: BNBuilders, Cornerstone, Skanska, and Spee West Construction.
The Selection Committee members, in alphabetical order, were as follows:
Laura Bowers, Design & Construction Manager, Edmonds School District
Amy Jain, Project Architect, NAC Architecture
Chris Long, Custodial & Warehouse Manager, Edmonds School District
Victoria Page, Construction Project Coordinator, Edmonds School District
Philip Riedel, Principal in Charge, NAC Architecture
Will Thomsen, Design & Construction Manager, Edmonds School District
Taine Wilton, Capital Projects Director, Edmonds School District
The shortlisted firms responded to all parts of the Request for Proposals which the Selection Committee rated based on the criteria identified
in the RFP and were given to each shortlisted team in advance. These criteria are described in full in the attached tabulation.
The Selection Committee conducted an interview specific to the GC/CM alternative delivery method, addressing the eight categories of
project-related questions.
Proposing firms were required to submit sealed proposals including the cost of their fee or profit for the entire construction project, along with
their Specified General Conditions to manage the project and the cost for one-month additional Specified General Conditions. The Fee
Proposals are shown on the attached Qualifications and Cost rating, Tabulation of Proposal Costs.
The committees recommendation is based on a combination of qualifications and cost and is attached.
The Capital Projects Office recommends a preliminary budget authorization of $20,000,000 for architectural design as well as Cornerstone's

preconstruction services. Once a GMP has been negotiated with Cornerstone General Contractors, staff will recommend full budget
authorization at that time. No construction would occur without Board authorization.

Background:
In accordance with state requirements, our districts Title I Parent and Family Engagement policy (Board

application. The current policy, last revised in 2008, does not meet the comprehensive and detailed
standards now required by state and federal guidelines. The newly proposed policy, adapted from the
Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA) Model policy and customized with districtspecific language, significantly expands on the original framework to enhance parent and family
engagement across all Title I schools in our district.
