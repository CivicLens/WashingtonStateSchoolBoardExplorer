Re: District Budget Advisory Committee (DBAC) Update
____________________________________________________________________________
The District Budget Advisory Committee held its first meeting of the fiscal year on Tuesday, October 8, 2024. The primary focus
was to review preliminary financial data from the previous fiscal year, including the ending fund balance, areas of overspending,
and cash flow trends. This meeting was crucial for setting the stage for budget planning for the upcoming fiscal year.
Key Discussion Points

1. Ending Fund Balance: The ending fund balance for the fiscal year 2023-2024 currently stands at $4.15 million.
2. Areas of Overspending: The committee discussed several key areas where the district exceeded budgeted amounts:
a. Staffing costs: certificated salaries and benefits represented a significant portion of the overspend due to
unanticipated hiring needs and items not being included in the initial budget.

b. Special Education:Additional resources allocated to special education services exceeded the initial budget due to
increased student needs and external service contracts.

3. Cash Flow Trends: Time was spent reviewing anticipated pinch points in the districts liquidity for the upcoming fiscal
year.

Supporting Research Documents: Materials from the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) on budget processes

and reductions, equity in budgeting, and strategies for addressing budget shortfalls were shared to provide context on best
practices.

Re: Monthly Financial Reports September 2024
____________________________________________________________________________
Attached are the preliminary financial reports for August 2024.

1. General Fund
a. Commentary
b. Summary of Revenues and Expenditures
c. Budget Status Reports for All Funds
d. Monthly Financial Statement

Commentary:
Revenues for September totalled $5,286,778.60.
Local Property Tax collections were $145,734.56.
State apportionment collections for September thru December reflect the budget and not actual enrollment. For
September, general state revenue was 68% of total revenue.
Local non-tax support was 9% of the total revenue, and includes PTO and other donations, student fees, and food
service deposits.
Expenditures for September totalled $7,191,144.27.
Expenditures outpaced revenue for the month by $1, 904 365.67
September is a higher than normal payroll month due to the payment of the August professional development
days for certificated staff.
Approximately 75% of the total instructional and support expenditures were spent on core instructional programs
(Regular Instruction, Special Education, Vocational Instruction and Compensatory Education).
Grant claims for September expenses will be collected in October.
Fund Balance:
The ending fund balance in the General Fund currently stands at $2,248,045.38. Cash flow is not sufficient to support a normal
twice monthly Accounts Payable runs. The District is moving to a large run at the end of the month, with a much smaller
supplemental run mid-month for utilities and will utilize this timing for the entirety of the fiscal year. While tax collections in
October will alleviate cash flow on a temporary basis, it will need to be closely monitored throughout the year.
