2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
 Increased board communications, especially in the areas of bond, levy and facilities updates,
and start and end times.
 As always, the superintendent keeps the board well informed and up to date on issues and
goings-on within the district.
 While reference in the report to formal reports at meetings and written reports on district
initiatives is in itself very commendable, the standout is the sheer number of informal
communications via emails, 1:2 meetings and almost immediate responses to board members’
inquiries. The superintendent appears to be extremely sensitive and savvy to keeping the
board immediately informed, especially given our current social state of knowing “now”
through digital immediacy.
 The superintendent has kept both the board and the community well informed about the
district. In talking to parents about recent changes, the only negatives have been that they
don't necessarily agree with what they've read -- not that they weren't aware of the changes.
 The board appreciates that the superintendent considers communication with the board to be a
high priority.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
 This is not a comment about improvement, but a thought as the board examines its role with
regard to “advocacy.” Item 2.e.ii refers to a system to inform the board of opportunities for
members to participate in district events. Depending upon how the board refines its advocacy
role, this might be a time for an expansion of that system.
 The board would like to strive for a minimum of four linkages and four study sessions each
year.
4. Comments on the report itself.
 It is amazing to see the amount of e-mails sent in the span of one year (590). This report
solidifies the board’s belief that there is good communication between the superintendent and
the board.
 The report might understate the superintendent’s strength in this area.
5. Possible changes to the policy.
 The EL could use a bit of streamlining and focus. What does the board specifically want to
know?
 Would like to discuss 2. e. ii & iii with the board to further define expectations and increase
clarity, if necessary
