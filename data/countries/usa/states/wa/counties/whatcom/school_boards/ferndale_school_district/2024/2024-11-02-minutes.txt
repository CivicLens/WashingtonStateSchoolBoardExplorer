6. MATTERS FOR BOARD DISCUSSION
Discussion: 6.01 Cell Phones for Directors
Discussion of issuing a District cell phone so that personal phones are not used for Board
business. If District email is installed on your personal phone or receive text messages on District
business, it becomes subject to public records requests. In some cases, this may mean you would
lose the use of the device until it has been scanned for records requested. Question raised of
adding an 'app' that can be installed that will identify you as a board director but not reveal your
personal phone number, camouflaging your personal information. Dr. Dominguez will work with
the Technology Department and Ms. Rodriguez to gather additional information. We will
provide and update at the next meeting.
