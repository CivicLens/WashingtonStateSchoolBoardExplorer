Hofstetter and Aster Early Learning
Reading Focus-Every decision we intentionally make regarding reading instruction will be to ensure Hofstetter
students reach The 95% (research proven % of students who can read at grade level if given intentional, focused and
research proven reading instruction).

Developmental Preschool
Our Developmental Preschool is an early intervention special education program for three and four year olds who
show significant developmental delay in defined areas.
●

Physical development: A student's ability to move, see, and hear

●

Cognitive development: A student's ability to learn and think

●

Communication development: A student's ability to understand and use language

●

Social or emotional development: A student's ability to relate to others and exhibit age-appropriate
behaviors

●

Adaptive development: A student's ability to perform age-appropriate self-help skills

Transition to Kindergarten
We are currently housing four TK classrooms at the Aster building. TK is for students who would benefit from a “get
ready for school” year before kindergarten. Students must be 4 years old by September 1. Students learn how to be
part of a school community and develop social-emotional skills along with pre academic skills.
Kindergarten
Hofstetter K is currently sitting at 18 kids per classroom. Our K teachers are: Jessica Carmell, Jenny Bohren, Michael
Westphal, Nichole Pierce, Mackenzie Goodwin, and Abigail Wolfe. Kinder students have been in school five days
now. We are working to build strong Hofstetter foundational routines and procedures with our littles. An example of
this is the term “space bubble”. This means self-control by keeping the body inside personal space. We check our
space bubbles in lines, at recess, in the bathrooms, etc. “Space bubble” is a common term used in every class, hallway
and space at Hofstetter.
1st Grade
First grade staff: Jennifer Kelley, Hannah Gormon, Jennie Dalton, Jacki Smoldon, Jaelynn Skok and Kaylee Hopper.
The 1st Grade Skills Inventory (1st SI) and the PAST (phonological awareness screening test) have been administered.
Small group reading instruction (Walk to Read) has begun based on student reading placement tests. Additionally,
Walk to Learn (Intervention or Extension) will begin on Monday, September 23, based on the 1st SI and PAST results.
30% of 1st graders need additional time and support in either Concept of Spoken Word, Rhyme Production or
Rhyme Recognition. These three concepts are essential standards that a student must master in order to learn how to
read. They are part of our Guaranteed and Viable Curriculum, which means we guarantee we teach it, assess it, and
provide additional time and support until mastery. These skills are essential, foundational and building block skills
and concepts.

2nd Grade
Second Grade Staff: Liz Gill, Tommie Tharaldson, Ashley Moore, Josie Clark, Jordan Groce and Kylee Frazer. Second
grade has also administered the 2nd SI and the PAST. Their Walk to Read has also begun and their Walk to Learn
starts Monday as well. Their intervention focus skill areas are phonemic awareness onset rime (The division of a
syllable into two parts: the onset and the rime. The onset is the initial consonant sound, blend, or digraph, and the
rime is the following vowel and all subsequent sounds in the syllable. An example is in the CVC word, cat. “C” is the
onset consonant sound. “AT” is the rime. It is the subsequent sounds.) and phonemic awareness digraphs (A digraph
is a combination of two letters that work together to make one sound, or phoneme, for example: sh, th) and blends (st
in stop or ct in act). At-grade-level and extension groups will focus on writing-reading it, hearing it, writing it.
Fort Colville Elementary School

★

We’ve had a great start to the 24/25 school year! Students and staff are getting to know each other. Our new
playground equipment is a huge hit with the students!

Grade level and department teams/PLCs meet weekly. This is time for staff to discuss learning targets,
instructional strategies, and formative and summative assessments. Staff will analyze data to plan for
instruction and interventions.

Dorian Studio will be in our building Friday morning to take staff and student pictures. We are glad to have
them back!

★

Fort Colville will hold their Bingo for Books/Parent/Family Engagement Night on Wednesday, October 2nd
from 5:00 to 7:00pm. The goal of this night is to share our curriculum, explain what Title 1 is and how it
helps students, and ways to support learning at home. We anticipate a successful evening with a lot of
parents and families present.

★

Mrs. Johansen has our Scholastic Book Fair scheduled for the week of September 30th through October 4th.
This event is a fundraiser for our library and provides families with an opportunity to celebrate reading.

weeks from the Falcon’s Nest (PBIS Store).

understand the science of teaching students how to read. This will include 4 full days in Spokane and
approximately 60 hours of “homework” throughout this school year.

Colville Junior High School

The Raptor Update:
●

We are off to a great start at CJHS! We have the highest enrollment to date at the Junior High since I (Mr.
Burch) have been in the district. It feels good to be over the 400 mark, but you also feel the fullness of our
building. It's a great problem to have! Students have all taken the first round of our district benchmark
assessment in STAR. Teachers are focused on working in their PLCs around their essential standards and
tracking each student by standard. Teachers will focus this year's Student Growth Goals on their essential
standards and work to support each other reaching those goals.

●

1st Day Welcome Back
○

On the first day of school, we had a welcome back assembly that set the tone for starting the school
year. We introduced staff and the student ASB council, followed by our continued focus on
attendance and respect! We then got the gym rocking with some music and had 3 class
competitions for the prestigious spirit stick and early lunch honors. Our 7th grade class came out
on top of the spirited competitions. Mrs. McEvoy took some great pictures and captured some
pretty happy kiddos! (Pictures below)

●

Safety Drill
○

We ran our first safety drill of the school year on Friday the 13th. Students and staff all participated
in an evacuation drill (fire drill). During this drill I communicated to students and staff the
expectations of what the drill would look like and then we set off the fire alarm so new staff and
students could hear and recognize our alarm system. The drill went smoothly and staff and
students did an amazing job with the evacuation drill.

●

CJHS Raptor Fall Sports
○

We currently have Cross Country, Softball, Football Cheer, and Football competing. We had a great
turnout for our fall teams and our varsity football team won a big first game on the 17th in double
overtime. This was the first win for our football team in a number of years. We are optimistic that
getting our youth program going again will support the growth in our football program at the
junior high.

Turnout Numbers

Football - 43

Cross Country - 25 boys and 15 girls

Facilities
The month of September the Maintenance crew has been finishing up some large projects. Along with the new
playground structure at Fort Colville, the Maintenance crew has been installing four new basketball hoops and poles.
We have also painted new four square courts and plan on painting the new basketball courts in the following weeks.
In the later part of summer the Junior High suffered a lightning strike. The strike caused failures in both the main
building panel along with the annex fire alarm panel. As I am writing this report the last panel is being replaced.
After installation of the new panel the fire alarm system will be new and in good working order.
The Grounds crew continue to work hard at making our district clean, safe and pleasing to the eye. I would like to
say thank you for that!
There are a lot of irons in the fire at the moment, we have plans to continue improving our facilities and making our
district a better place.
As usual a big thank you to all of our staff for everything you do. Please feel free to contact me with questions or
concerns.
6.02 WIAA Allocations and Amendments
Superintendent Knight and CHS Athletic Director Blake Sjordal have been working with other Washington school
districts on WIAA amendment proposals to protect our female athletes. The District previously passed a resolution
supporting fairness in competition and commitment to protecting female sports and will continue to work towards
getting these rules changed. Mr. Sjordal has been continually working on our state allocations and fall sport post
season play and updated the board on these scenarios. With the new 4 team league, the NEA only receives one berth
to state. Mr. Sjordal is working with District 5 to allow a second team play in opportunities.
7. Superintendent’s Report
7.01 CHS Student Update
Rachel Stutzer-Ferrell, Student Representative, updated the Board on recent CHS activities:
August 29th was our fourth annual Freshman First Day. Freshmen were paired up with an upper classman mentor
and had a great time learning what CHS is all about.
CHS Clubs are in full swing and are having weekly meetings. All clubs are welcoming new members.
CHS Athletics are off to a great start with 163 athletes participating in Fall Sports.
Class Meetings were held on September 11. Mr. Groce, Mr. Bateman, Mr. Cleveland, and Mr. Sjordal went over
campus rules and expectations.
School pictures were on September 12 and ran very smoothly.
