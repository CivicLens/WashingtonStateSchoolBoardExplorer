The Bellingham School District Board of Directors held a study session on March 2, 2016, to discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing a balanced calendar system.

Conversely, opponents highlighted concerns about disrupting family vacations, impacting the local business community reliant on student summer employment, and logistical challenges related to transportation and food services. The discussion also touched upon exploring alternative strategies to support struggling students and considering pilot programs at specific grade levels or schools before district-wide implementation.
