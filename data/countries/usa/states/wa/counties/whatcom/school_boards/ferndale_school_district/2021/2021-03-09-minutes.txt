3. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
Information: 3.01 Considerations and Next Steps for the Selection of the New Superintendent
Mr. McLaurin informed audience members that Dr. Quinn let the Board know that she
intends to retire, either at the conclusion of her current contract year, which is June 30,
2021, or within a few months after that, depending on the decisions made by the Board.
Mr. McLaurin said as allowable under the Open Public Meetings Act, Dr. Quinn
informed the Board of her pending retirement during an Executive Session scheduled for
the purpose of reviewing her performance and contract. He reminded audience members
that the Board is not allowed to make any decisions or take any actions during an
Executive Session; therefore, the Board called this special meeting to discuss how the
Board would like to move forward with selecting a replacement.
Mr. McLaurin noted that upon learning Dr. Quinnâ€™s decision, he had a conversation with
Larry Francois, the Superintendent of Northwest Educational Service District, to learn

more about the typical superintendent search process. Ms. Riddle had a similar
conversation with Tim Garchow, the Executive Director of the Washington State School
Directors Association.
Mr. McLaurin said from these conversations, we have learned that there are two options
we can pursue:
1. The Board can hire a search firm as soon as possible and conduct a full-blown
search to select and hire a new superintendent between now and June 30th, which
is the date when most educational administrators are free to move into new
positions.
2. Or appoint an interim superintendent for the 2021-2022 school year and take a
more measured, less rushed approach to finding a new superintendent, who would
begin his or her tenure in the Ferndale School District in the summer of 2022.
Mr. McLaurin noted that if the Board chose the second option, Dr. Quinn has agreed to
stay in her role through the summer. He noted that since she still has one more year on
her three-year contract, the Board would not need to make any changes for that to
happen.
Ms. Riddle explained the process they used when hiring Superintendent Dr. Quinn.
Mr. McLaurin explained the process of what they would need to accomplish in the next
few months to move forward with option number 1.
The Board discussed issues and restrictions that they would face with gathering
community input during this time because of COVID.
The majority of the Board agreed that it would feel rushed if they tried to hire a new
superintendent by June 30.
Mr. McLaurin noted that within our district there is the Operational Expectations policy
(OE-2) for superintendent succession which could be used in this situation. In our district,
the staff member is Assistant Superintendent Mark Deebach. He said that Mr. Deebach
could step in if Dr. Quinn is no longer able to do the job. The Board has the opportunity
to discuss with Mr. Deebach the possibility of him stepping into an interim role for one
year.
In a consensus vote, four out of five of the Board members agreed to have an interim
superintendent for a year and begin conducting the search for the new superintendent in
the fall.
The Board would like to set up an Executive Session to look into all personnel options for
an interim superintendent and decide as a group before Mr. McLaurin speaks to Mr.
Deebach. The Board will have an Executive Session on Tuesday, March 16 at 7:00pm to
discuss the interim superintendent further.
