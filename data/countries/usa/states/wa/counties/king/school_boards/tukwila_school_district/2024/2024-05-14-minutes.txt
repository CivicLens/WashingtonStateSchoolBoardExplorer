  3. Public Comment
  A. Public Comment
  Vice President Simpson called for Public Comments. 
  Vice President Simpson read the following public comments received electronically: 
  Gavin Steinmetz - Student - Because of the debt the school district is in teachers are not being renewed. We as students are asking you to reconsider your decision on renewing Anthony Pascual’s contract. We have made a petition for him to keep his job and if our demands aren’t addressed before May 15th we will protest.
  Arista Alejandro - Student - I want you to reconsider your decision to terminate Ms. Fichamba. In my role as a student, she has been the biggest advocate for students’ futures and should be your first choice for her role. Since the sixth grade, she has been my main source of support. She helped me access college options that no one at Foster High School was unable to provide. My counselor has too many students to work with to be very encouraging and intentionally helpful, so Ms. Fichamba has always helped to push me to explore my talents in science. She is the only one who has assisted me in connecting with my main college and who has given me positive feedback about my subject-matter knowledge or comprehension. She has assisted many learners in locating top colleges where they can receive grants and scholarships. She has assisted me by researching universities with a reputation for accepting forensic science majors. She was a huge asset when it came to researching colleges, and she has also encouraged me to seek universities abroad. In cutting her and her position, you are depriving kids of the assistance they require while completing the FAFSA or applying for scholarships. If you don't decide to change your mind, you are removing the one resource that hundreds of students may rely on for college assistance. While we students are preparing for college, she provides us with the motivation and knowledge to lessen our struggles. She is responsible for getting students tens of thousands, if not into the millions, of dollars in scholarships and grants. Cutting her position shows future Foster High School students that this district does not care about their future. They don't care about setting them up for success in career paths that are unique to them and their interests. Please reconsider reinstating Ms. Fichamba to her College and Career Readiness role. Please help support current and future Foster students in their pursuits of planning their futures by maintaining the one person who has the knowledge and the trusting relationships with students and families in our school. Thank you for your time and consideration.
  Courtney Martinez - Teacher - Good afternoon school board. I am writing today in response to recent staffing and position cuts. My children have been in the Tukwila School District since kindergarten; now both will be at Foster next year for their senior and freshman years. When they were in kindergarten, college and a career seemed so far away. Then, when my oldest was in 6th grade, we were connected with Ms. Fichamba and began learning about all the career paths available to my child and all TSD children. Ms. Fichamba was the Gear Up College and Career Specialist, and while her title may have been wordsmithed over the years, she helped to guide students down paths towards successful futures. Futures that did not just include 4-year colleges, but trades too! She has been the stead contact for all my college and career questions that I have had for both of my children as we have been slowly (and way too quickly) getting closer to their launch into adulthood. Hearing that this critical position has been cut is gut-wrenching; especially as my child, and many peoples children, are entering their senior years and preparing for the stress along with it. The stress of navigating FAFSA, which has changed to become less difficult, but became MORE difficult. The stress of how to pay for college. The stresses of if college is even the right fit for them. The stress of being an adult and what that entails. Ms. Fichamba has helped to guide not only my child but hundreds of children through these issues. She has built the trust and respect from our greater school community. She has demonstrated time and time again that she is here for all our children and their successes! She inspired my daughter to attempt running start, and as a result she will be graduating Foster High School with not only her diploma, but an Associates Transfer Degree. This was because of Ms. Fichamba and her position. It was because of her dedication to our students and her unwavering support for their success. I understand that we are in a financial crisis. I understand hard cuts need to be made. But I'm left wondering, what is the purpose of Foster High School if it isn't to launch these scholars into career paths that inspire them? Without this position, who will take on this important job? The counselors, who are already stretched WAY too thin? I can guarantee that the same level of commitment and dedication to students post secondary plans will not be as successful. Foster High School will become a printing press for diplomas that are placed on dressers or shoved under beds without a second thought, as students try to blindly navigate the already tumultuous journey into adulthood. Please choose to invest in our students' futures. Please save the college and career readiness position. Please save Ms. Fichamba.
  Miranda Garcia - Student - Ms.Fichamba has positively impacted me in a way that has made me push out of my comfort zone which is very rare for a quiet person like me. She has seen me grow since middle and has supported me since the very beginning. Up until the pandemic Ms.Fichamaba still made sure that I was given the middle school experience despite being online and offering virtual appointments to talk about anything that I had on my plate. Entering Foster as a freshman I was utterly clueless and extremely shy, however when I came to visit the college and career center to see Ms.Fichamba she automatically created a pathway for me as well as classes to consider for my specific career that I was thinking of pursuing. That very same year I was enrolled in AVID where Ms.Fichamaba made sure that all the resources and information I needed was provided for me. One day in particular was when she encouraged me to join all of the academic opportunities she organized for students, especially the college visits that occurred every month. Because of these events it has allowed me to get out of my comfort zone and begin networking with the college officials and start looking for what I want to do in the future. `Another event was when she organized a field trip to the NACAC college fair that was a key moment for my education. This moment helped me realize all the possible schools that I’m able to attend and the experiences that can help me grow as a person. My plan throughout high school was to only attend four year universities within the state of Washington but attending the NACAC college fair expanded my horizons and diverse programs that haven’t crossed my mind. Not only did this college fair give me school choices but it also alternated my career pathway and see free grants for that specific career pathway. For every trip, internships, and programs Ms.Fichamba was always there to speak for every student and to make sure what I needed was there, including the MindsMatter program that has supported me in every way possible for both academically and personally. As a first-generation student this program has supported my goals into pursuing higher education and handle obstacles that prevent me from accomplishing my goal. I wouldn’t have considered participating in MindsMatter if it wasn’t for Ms.Fichamba who knew what I needed to assist me in my academic goals. All the given opportunities that she has provided for me all share one thing which is to support me in my academic goals. Ms.Fichamba has helped me tremendously especially coming from an immigrant family that has sacrificed everything and left their homeland to give me a better education. As a result of everything she has given me, she has not only helped me but also my family who needed it the most.
  Three additional public comment forms were received electronically through the website, however, there was no public statement included, and only a topic was listed.  
  Madyson Martin - I want to talk about the loss of the college and career center as well as budget restrictions. 
  Paytin Kupferer - Comment about what is happening in the district currently and how the staff cuts affect the students. 
  Jennifer Fichamba - Regarding district budget cuts and the effect on students
  4. Discussion Items
  A. Discipline Plan - Review
  Scott Whitbeck, Chief Academic Officer, presented the Discipline Plan. 
  Highlights included: 
  Equity Analysis Key Questions
Race and Equity Data 
          -Underrepresented Groups - Overrepresentations of Black/African-American and Multiracial students being assigned suspensions or expulsions
          -Potential Impacts - Students miss school, not able to develop a sense of belonging at school, lose trust in schools, and are unable to meet their hopes and dreams.
Existing Disparities through a Racial Equity Lens - Mid-Year Data 
          -Students who identify as Black/African American make up 22% of our total student population, but they received 3% of all suspensions/expulsions. 
          -Students who identify as Multiracial make up only 6% of our student count, but received 14% of all suspensions/expulsions. 
          -Students who identify as Hispanic make up 37% of our student body but receive only 34% of all suspensions/expulsions. 
Stakeholders in Addressing Disproportionate Discipline through an Anti-Racism Lens - principals, racial equity leads and teams, building leadership teams, superintendent advisory committee. 
Barriers to Equitable Outcomes - Lack of consistency in responses to student behaviors and insufficient system-wide understanding of racially equitable discipline practices. 
Next Steps and Ongoing Next Steps 
  Director Larson asked when students are identifying as multi-racial, are we listing all multi-racial choices?  CAO Whitbecked confirmed that we are listing all choices.  Director Larson shared that he wondered if there was an overlap between multi-racial and Black. He asked if that could be part of the Black over-representation.  CAO Whitbeck shared that we have started to look at this data, however, it is complex and is something that we would be able to put together for a future meeting. Superintendent Pedroza shared that in moving forward with intersectional data, we first have to fix a technical issue.  Additionally, when requesting two or more identifiers, it would be helpful to hear from the Board what they would like to see, i.e. race, program mix of both, etc.  We can't do all of it, but we can focus on two to three succinct areas. Director Larson shared we are looking for disproportionalities wherever they may exist, i.e. race, gender, program, chronic absence and discipline.    Additionally, we are looking at referrals, offenses, and suspensions.  So, for example, how many of them are coming out of incidents with substitutes?  CAO Whitbeck invited the principals in attendance to respond to the question from Director Larson.  The principals shared that it was a very small amount, i.e. 1 to 4 incidents.  Director Hoover shared that they want to make sure that we are looking at data with curiosity. It would even be okay to share the questions that we asked ourselves when reviewing the data.  This helps get a sense of how we are looking at all of the different potential intersectionalities that exist and seeing students who are marginalized.      
  Principal Parker shared that restorative practice and common terminology are part of the SIP goal for discipline at Foster High School. Staff and scholars will work together to come up with an agreement on what restorative practices look like in action. 
  Director Simpson shared that approximately two-thirds of our students represent three-fourths of our exclusions.  Why is this an existing disparity?  How are we addressing this as a team as this number is very large.  As for asking what we want to see as a Board, we need to have more discussion about this than just this minute. 
  Director Kruller asked if there was a benchmark for our data compared to other schools.  Do we have a benchmark against schools that are succeeding? Are we using any continuous improvement practices, i.e. fishbone, root causes, etc.?  What is our line in the sand?  Superintendent Pedroza shared that OSPI publishes all exclusions and suspensions at the end of the year.  This data is available to everyone.  Director Larson requested the Board to receive the school's comprehensive discipline plan.  Director Larson asked how are you going to get student and family voices into these discussions? CAO Whitbeck shared that we will be working with each principal to get family engagement.   
    5. Presentations
  A. Department Update - Technology
  Hsian-Yu Kuo, Director of Information Technology, presented to the Board.
  Director Larson commented with the reduction of support staff in this area, will the Help Desk response times be affected?  Director Larson asked what is the current response time.  Mr. Kuo shared that currently, response time is within 24 hours.  There is an exception if an issue will need further research, which could take several days.    
  Director Larson asked if we were getting close to our internet capacity. Mr. Kuo shared that our current capacity is 5G.  We currently use 2G and have never surpassed that.  With the network wireless updates completed last year, the speeds are much faster. Therefore, we will monitor this.  If we get close to our 5G capacity, then we will up our capacity to 10G. Bigger districts have 10G, as we are a small district, 5G should be sufficient.   
  Director Larson shared with the rest of the Board what the e-rate funding is and how it is funded.  Currently, we are at the top rate.  Are we going to stay at the top rate for the foreseeable future? Mr. Kuo shared that we will be watching this for any changes. Additionally, we will not be applying for this next year.  Our next application will be in 2025. CFO Fleming shared that there is a statewide committee that meets to discuss financial/accounting items and e-rates have been the subject of a lot of change.  It is now considered a federal program. The committee discussed ways to ensure CEP schooling and what they might put in place for CEP.  We anticipate we will get new guidance. Director Larson commented that we want to make sure that we do not get the short end of the stick and asked if we are using a survey tool to record income and are we getting a high return rate on this?  CFO Fleming shared that there was someone doing this work early this year.  This ia a statewide problem and we need to encourage higher participation.  It is difficult to get responses from families, so we need to have various tools for families to provide input. 
  Director Larson commented on the partnership with the City of Tukwila and Chromebooks. Mr. Kuo shared that there are still quite a few left in the office, even though many students already have one.  Currently, this program is under the City of Tukwila.  this is a trial run as they want to see if the funding of Chromebooks will improve the student's grades.  There are specific guidelines regarding who will receive a Chromebook.   Director Larson commented that he would like to know the following information: 
  How many do we have still 
How many have we sent out
Is it growing or not growing
Do they have an objective to monitor the students for three years
Want to see if it grows to get more funding. 
  Director Larson commented that he wanted to see their annual report.

24-25 School Year 
          - We are working with the Tukwila Community Center on possibly getting a grant to help support our Intramural Sports Program at the Elementary Schools.
          - We have officially started our own local AAU Basketball Team called Tuk-City Bulldogs. We have one team so far for 4th and 5th graders from our elementary schools, and we plan on creating teams for 6th-8th grade as the program grows.
          - We have also started a Foster Jr. Bulldogs Football Team for the kids in our community to have access to them. The age groups offered range from 3rd to 8th grade.
          - We plan to continue finding feeder programs for sports like soccer, tennis, baseball, and softball. These programs will give the kids in our community opportunities that have never been offered here in Tukwila. It will give them a positive outlet that is local, and beneficial for community growth.
  Director Larson shared that he appreciated all of Director Guiterrez's energy and the work that he is putting into the sports program. this is the most active athletic program that TSD has had in a number of years.  Director Larson inquired about the replacement of the scoreboard in the gym.  The current scoreboard has several lights that are out and not functional, so it was hard to tell what was on the scoreboard. What is the plan for updating the scoreboard?  Director Guiterrez shared that he and Director Cardenas have been getting quotes from the vendor that we used for the scoreboards. We have received quotes, which included installation costs, and we are currently $20K - $30K short.  We are looking at alternate funding sources.  In the meantime, we have ordered lightbulbs to replace the burnout lights.  This is a stopgap to buy us a little time, while we continue to look at grants and other sources of funding for a full replacement of the scoreboard.  Director Larson commented that there are a variety of scoreboards available, so perhaps we can look at a more cost-effective scoreboard.  He also shared that the scoreboard in the smaller gym is new.  Why can't we remove it and put it in the main gym? Director Cardenas shared that the cost to remove one of the scoreboards and install it in the main gym is not cost-effective as the scoreboard is smaller and there would need to be some additional adjustments to make it fit securely.  Director Cardenas shared that we can look into getting an LED scoreboard and grants for funding.   
  Director Kruller asked what is the lifecycle of the scoreboards and are we able to make payments. CFO Fleming shared that payments are not allowed.   
  Director Hoover shared their thanks for expanding sports for all age groups and for your advocacy on continuing these programs. It's important to advocate for students who are not always represented and there are big barriers to trans and non-binary people in organized sports. Some things are outside of our control about how we label. What are the ways we are ensuring our sports programs are inclusive and trans students feel like they belong?  They want to put in a nudge for this to be thought about going into next year. They shared that they have some ideas and they are interested in partnering with Mr. Guiterrez on this so all students feel like they belong.  Mr. Guiterrez shared that this will be part of the work and focus for next year. 
  Director Simpson shared that during the presentation Director Guiterrez shared that he doesn't know how to proceed for next year due to the impact of our current financial situation.  When will the budget for next year be shared?  When will current impacts be shared with the Directors?  Superintendent Pedroza shared that CFO Fleming is working on the final numbers and can set a meeting with Director Guiterrez to discuss.  One of our goals is to maintain secondary programming and look at how to support elementary with unified sports.  There may be some scaling down for elementary.  Director Simpson commented when looking at the numbers,we need to circle back to make sure we understand how much money there is to be able to keep this going for our young people. He is a strong believer in after-school sports and wants to keep the programs going, 
  Director Larson commented that other districts charge for athletics.  We haven't charged before, so am I correct in assuming this practice will not change?  Dr. Pedroza shared that we will continue to not charge for athletics.  We are currently working with after-school programs to look at activities, arts, clubs, academics, athletics, etc.
  C. Department Update - Food Services
  Trevor Watt, Director of Dining Services, shared a presentation with the Board. 
  Highlights included: 
  Student Choice Program - students have the power to choose what's on their cafeteria menu.  This is another way to provide student voice. 
Nutrition Services - Mood Boost - teaches students which food may help them feel their personal best.
Cheers Program - monthly program used to recognize our staff members for the outstanding job that they do on a daily basis.  Staff have the opportunity to nominate one of their fellow staff to be recognized for going above and beyond. 
Fun Days Program - On a monthly basis there are nationally recognized fun days, so why not include them in our menu?  These days bring just a little more excitement to the meals that we serve to students.  
Discovery Kitchen - the platform allows us to integrate nutrition education and cooking demonstrations with our promotional calendar through dynamic monthly themes, connecting the lessons students learn with delicious dishes in the cafeteria. 
Budget Impacts - staffing costs, student participation, staff/teacher participation, and contractual agreement
Breakfast and lunch participation for 23-24
  Director Larson asked if there was an opportunity to get help from the superintendent student advisory committee to get ideas on how to get more student input.  Superintendent Pedroza shared that the advisory committee will definitely provide input.  Director Larson asked about the Chartwells' Scholarship program.  CFO Fleming shared that she researched the scholarship back to 2016.  The scholarship is used to help subsidize student lunch costs.  Since all breakfast and lunches are now free, we will be looking at what these funds can be directed towards. 
  Director Kruller asked if we worked with local farms.  Director Watt shared that there are rules and regulations around this.  At this time, no, we do not.   
  D. Department Update - Maintenance and Operations
  Liliana Cardenas, Director of Maintenance, Operations, and Capital Projects, shared a presentation with the Board. 
  Highlights included: 
  Maintenance & Operations oversees all building facilities, grounds, and construction, safety, operations, and building improvements. 
Staffing for the department. 
Maintencance and perations Budget 
Scheduled projects  - Sumer 2024
24-25 Budget Impacts - substitute pool, contracted janitorial services, utility increases, safety systems, fire systems, new project requests, state mandates, DOH mandates, and Fire Department mandates. 
  Director Simpson commented on the budget confirming that we will have a deficit this year.  Director Cardenas confirmed that we are going to have a deficit. We are not at the end of the year yet, and we still have some expenditures through August 31st, i.e. summer projects.
  Director Simpson asked where the surplus in 2020 and 2021 got accounted for going forward.  CFO Fleming shared that we do not carry the surplus forward if we don't spend it. 
  Director Proctor shared that for budgets, he would like to see the total budget, with expenditures, and variances, and the final balance after that.  
  Director Cardenas shared there will be a comprehensive report regarding the freezing of pipes incident at the May 28th Board meeting.  Director Simpson shared that we need to have a preventative plan. 
  Director Simpson asked where we are with the current levy, what we have left, and if we are over/under.  CFO Fleming shared that she would provide that information. 
  Director Simpson asked what is the professional development plan for staff to be able to do this work for long-term planning.  Director Cardenas shared that there is currently no incentive to staff to learn additional skills.  Director Simpson shared that vendors are charging significantly higher rates.  We need to look at how to attract skilled/licensed staff that specialize in plumbing, electrical, etc.  We need to invest in the people that are here.
