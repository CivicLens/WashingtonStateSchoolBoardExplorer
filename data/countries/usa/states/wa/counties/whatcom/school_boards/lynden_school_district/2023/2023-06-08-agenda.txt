Fisher 3rd graders took a field trip to the Whatcom Museum to experience up close Native American tradition and culture
which correlates with their CKLA learning that took place this year. They wrapped up the trip with a visit to the Lynden City
Park to play in our community resource. During their walk back to school, they applied their knowledge of using maps that
they learned at the beginning of the year!
Fisher 5th graders were tasked with using the Engineering Design Process to craft and design a project that would keep their
eggs safe after being dropped from the second story. Many students were able to complete the challenge and came out with
solid eggs and big smiles.
