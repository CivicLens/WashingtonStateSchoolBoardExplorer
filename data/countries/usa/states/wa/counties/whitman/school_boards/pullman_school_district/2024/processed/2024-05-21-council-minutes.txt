M. Public Hearing

N. Regular Agenda
Parks & Facilities Director Kurt Dahmen explained that city staff are seeking partial
funding for Pullman Veterans Memorial Park through a state grant opportunity.
The Washington Wildlife and Recreation Program (WWRP) provides land protection and
outdoor recreation funding. It serves the goals of acquiring valuable recreation and habitat
lands before they are lost to other uses and developing recreation areas for a growing
population. This legislation was passed in 1990, and governors, the Legislature, and
groups like the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition have supported continued
funding. The program is one of many competitive grants administered by the Washington
State Recreation and Conservation Office (RCO).
WWRP has several categories, each with different allocated funding. City staff prepared
an application for the Local Parks Category and submitted it on May 1st. The funding
request is for the development and construction of Pullman Veterans Memorial Park
(Phase 1) at 435 SE Fairmount Drive, adjacent to the City Cemetery. The City purchased
the land for this purpose in 2022. The park and its central features will be open and
available to the public after Phase 1.
City Staff requested $500,000, which is the maximum grant award amount. The City will
be responsible for the rest of the project cost, estimated at roughly $2 million. If selected,

the City will need to certify the availability of the remaining funds at least one month before
approval of grant funding, which is anticipated to be in early Summer 2025.
American Legion Post 52 is leading a fundraising campaign to secure donations and
community contributions. The ability to accept a potential RCO grant award depends on
successful fundraising and the ability to provide the rest of the project costs. If the project
is selected for an award and the remaining funds have been secured, staff will return to
the Council next summer regarding funding certification and a grant agreement.
The initial application was due May 1, and a technical review is underway. Staff will
receive feedback and suggestions for changes and then must resubmit by the Technical
Completion Deadline, July 18, 2024. Staff will also give a virtual presentation to an
evaluation team for project scoring this August. The Authorizing Resolution / Application
Authorization is due with the July 18 resubmission, which is the reason for this agenda
item. City Staff requests the Council's adoption of Resolution No. R-33-24, authorizing
the application and naming persons authorized to execute the grant documents.
Action, Resolution: 1.
RESOLUTION NO. R-33-24 - A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING SUBMISSION OF
A WASHINGTON WILDLIFE AND RECREATION PROGRAM GRANT
APPLICATION TO THE WASHINGTON STATE RECREATION AND
CONSERVATION OFFICE FOR PULLMAN VETERANS MEMORIAL PARK.
Motion by Pat Wright, second by Ann Parks.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Nathan Weller, Pat Wright, Megan Guido, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira,
Trymaine Gaither
Assistant Planner Ariel Medeiros explained that the Washington State Department of
Commerce invited the Community Development Department in August 2022 to join a pilot
program. The pilot was designed to test and improve the Model Climate Element with
resilience planning guidance. This Model Climate Element illustrates how counties and
cities can develop and implement plans, goals, and policies that build community-wide
climate resilience. The Model Climate Element provides different pathways for
communities that have done some or limited climate planning. The Planning Division had
meetings with Commerce every two weeks, working through the Model Climate Element
Guidelines, assisting with providing current plans for an audit, and working with the
Consultants (Cascadia Consulting Group and Berk Consulting, Inc.) on the Guidance
Workbook. Instead of creating a new Climate Element, the City opted to add climate
resiliency language throughout the current Comprehensive Plan. The Consultants
created maps showing Vulnerability and Risk Assessments and proposed language
changes and updates to the current Comprehensive Plan.
In March 2023, the Planning Commission started reviewing the proposed changes; in
April, the Commission requested to postpone continuing review until the new
Environmental Resilience Commission (ERC) reviewed the proposed changes. The ERC
started reviewing the proposed changes in September 2023. At their meeting on March
1, 2024, the ERC completed the review of the changes and voted unanimously to send
the proposed changes to the Planning Commission for final recommendation to the City
Council. Per RCW 35A.63.070 and Pullman City Code 17.110.020 and 17.180.030, a
public hearing is required before a recommendation is forwarded to the City Council. The
Planning Commission reviewed the changes during a public hearing during their regularly
scheduled meeting on March 27, 2024, and voted unanimously to forward a
recommendation for approval to the City Council.
Action, Resolution: 2.
RESOLUTION NO. R-34-24 - A RESOLUTION APPROVING AMENDMENTS
TO THE CITY OF PULLMAN COMPREHENSIVE PLAN RELATING TO
CLIMATE RESILIENCY.

Motion by Carla De Lira, second by Nathan Weller.
