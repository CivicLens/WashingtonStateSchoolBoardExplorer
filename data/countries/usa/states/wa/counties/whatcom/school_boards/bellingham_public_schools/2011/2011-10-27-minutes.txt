REGULAR AGENDA ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports
Steve Smith attended Senator Rankin’s meeting held at Fairhaven Middle School. He
commented it was interesting as the topic was about school funding. Dr. Smith also attended the
September meeting of the Bellingham Public School Foundation as an ex-officio member. He
enjoyed the Board’s Oct. 7 visit to Fairhaven Middle School, attended the Race for Education on
Oct. 8, which was co-sponsored by the Bellingham Public School Foundation and Communities
in Schools, and met with Superintendent Baker for a breakfast meeting.
Ken Gass participated in the Oct. 6 linkage with school/parent organizations representatives. He
participated in the Board’s Oct. 7 visit to Fairhaven Middle School and enjoyed the interaction
with the staff. He attended the Race for Education and expressed his appreciation to the
volunteers and runners who participated. Dr. Gass attended the Oct. 15 candidate forum
sponsored by the League of Women Voters. He met with Superintendent Baker for lunch and
visited two of his adopted schools. While visiting the Transportation Department, he learned
about the new online mapping system from the new manager. He also participated in Larrabee’s
jogathon.
Kelly Bashaw also participated in the activities mentioned by Dr. Smith and Dr. Gass and visited
Happy Valley Elementary, one of her adopted schools. Ms. Bashaw commented that Happy
Valley has gone through many transitions in recent years with the temporary closure of Lowell
Elementary and the opening of Wade King Elementary.
Ann Whitmyer attended the linkage on Oct. 6 with parent organization representatives and
visited Fairhaven Middle School with the Board on Oct. 7. She noted they are embracing
Response to Intervention (RtI) and were thoughtful about the kinds of interventions used. Ms.
Whitmyer also attended the Race for Education on Oct. 8.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report
Superintendent Greg Baker gave a brief report on the state budget. The Governor has requested a
reduction in the state budget of $2 billion for the current year. As presented, her plan would
impact all school districts. Two ideas cited as budget solutions would be to increase class size in
grades 4 to 12 and decrease instruction days from 180 to 175. The Legislature will be
considering budgets reductions in the special session, which begins in November.
Dr. Baker reported that district staff have been working on the Levy Task Force to make a
recommendation on the Maintenance and Operations Levy and the Technology Levy. Tom
Venable and Ralph Hayden co-chair the Task Force. Mr. Venable gave a brief overview of the

meetings, Ron Cowan gave a brief overview of basic school funding and Tanya Rowe updated
the Board on the work of the Citizens’ Advisory Committee and her development of a levy
communication plan.
Dr. Baker introduced Isabel Meaker, special assistant to the Superintendent and Latino Family
Liaison, and Amy Carder, program administrator for English Language Learners (ELL). They
demonstrated how technology is used to interpret information for families whose primary first
language is not English. This is one example of how the technology levy funds can help families.
Ms. Carder also reported on the English Language Learner (ELL) review process. As she
reported, the district has 11 new ELL certified specialists this year to support students, a
substantial increase from previous years to help bring our district into compliance and increase
student achievement. Ms. Carder shared the ELL models of delivery as compared with other
districts. She explained how our ELL instructional model benefits all students, not only those in
need of language acquisition support. The ELL program is putting together baseline data to
measure student/program success.
Dr. Baker reported that a team of 10 staff members attended the Association of Latino
Administrators and Superintendents (ALAS) Conference in San Francisco held Oct. 12–14. Dr.
Baker felt attending this conference was a positive experience for the attendees and will inform
and enhance our work with Latino families. Superintendent Baker expressed appreciation to Ms.
Meaker for her work engaging Latino families. He also thanked Steve Clarke for coordinating
the travel details and for promoting this positive experience for the staff who attended the
conference.
