Authority of the Superintendent
The Board will provide direction to the Superintendent through written policies that define the organizational results to be
achieved for students and define operational conditions and actions to be accomplished or avoided.
1. The Board will develop Results policies instructing the Superintendent to achieve defined results for the students served
by the district.
2. The Board will develop Operational Expectations policies which express the Boards values about operational conditions
and actions. Certain of these values will be expressed positively to assure that the stated actions occur and the identified
conditions exist, and will be stated as directives. Certain other values represent actions and conditions that are to be
avoided, and will be stated prohibitively.
3. As long as the Superintendent uses any reasonable interpretation of the Boards Results and Operational Expectations
policies, the Superintendent is authorized to establish any additional district policies or regulations, make any decisions,
establish any practices and develop any activities the Superintendent deems appropriate to achieve the Boards Results
policies. The Superintendent is not expected to seek Board approval or authority for any such decisions falling within the
Superintendents area of delegated authority.
4. The Board may change its Results and Operational Expectations policies, and in so doing shift the boundary between
Board and Superintendent areas of responsibility. The Board will respect and support any reasonable interpretation of its
policies by the Superintendent, even though Superintendent decisions may not be the decisions the Board or its
members may have made.
