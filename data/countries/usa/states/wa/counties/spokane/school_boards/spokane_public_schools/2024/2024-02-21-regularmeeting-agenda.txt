Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation:
Approval of contract expenditures in the amount of $169,581.00 for the AVID College Preparation Program.
Background:
In June of 2005, the District entered into an agreement with AVID, a non-profit corporation, for the purpose of providing a
program designed to increase school-wide learning and performance to ensure that all students will succeed, and especially
students from underrepresented populations. AVID is designed to promote equity and prepare students for a post-secondary
career pathway. AVID incorporates an elective experience for secondary students as well as school-wide strategies for all K-12
classrooms. In the elective course, participating secondary students learn organizational and study skills, work on critical
thinking, ask probing questions, get academic help from peers and college tutors, and participate in enrichment and motivational
activities. School-wide AVID strategies are utilized in all elementary, middle and traditional high schools as well as TEC at
Bryant. School staff receive access to a vast set of resources, training supports, and materials to enhance the use of best
instructional strategies.
This expenditure is for the period July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025.
