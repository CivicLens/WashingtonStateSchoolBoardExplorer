We encourage community members to communicate their ideas to the Board directors and the superintendent. Specific duties of the local Board of Directors include: Employing a school superintendent, principals, teachers, and other personnel. Establishing appropriate courses of study equal to or greater than required by the State Board of Education. Adopting a school budget. Determining local levies. Assessing teaching materials. Establishing local policies. The Board of Directors selects the Superintendent of schools to serve as its chief executive officer. It is the responsibility of the superintendent to recommend the appointment of all other personnel to the Board and to bring recommendations to the Board for action in carrying on the work of the District. Regular meetings of the Board are held at 5:00 pm on the fourth Monday of each month, except if the 4th Monday falls on a holiday or during a school break, the regular board meeting may be rescheduled to a different date. The meetings are held in the Board of Directors room in the District Office building, 305 N 6th Street. Meeting agendas are available in the superintendent's office two days before each regular meeting and can be found on BoardDocs Agenda page . All regular and special board meetings are open to the public. All actions authorized or required by law are taken at open meetings. The Board may, however, meet in executive (closed) sessions to discuss dealing with personnel, property considerations, employee negotiations, or possible litigation. Constituents of the La Conner School District who plan to comment on agenda items at board meetings are encouraged to contact the superintendent in advance. By using this process, the Board can be prepared to answer specific questions and have any requested information available.
