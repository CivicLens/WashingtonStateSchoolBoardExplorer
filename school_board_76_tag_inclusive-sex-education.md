The Battle Ground Public Schools Board of Directors held a regular meeting on October 14, 2024, where various topics were discussed, including updates from student representatives on events at their schools and the importance of community engagement. Notably, citizens addressed the board on issues related to LGBTQ+ representation, Indigenous Peoples month, and inclusive sex education. The board approved the retirement of Policy 5612, which dealt with Temporary Administrators, as it was deemed redundant with Policy 5001 regarding the hiring of retired school employees. Additionally, revisions to Policy 6220 on Bid or Request for Proposal Requirements were approved to reflect changes in statutory law under Senate Bill 5268. Superintendent Denny Waters provided insights into the AWARE grant's purpose, which aims to enhance mental health support and social-emotional learning initiatives within the district.
