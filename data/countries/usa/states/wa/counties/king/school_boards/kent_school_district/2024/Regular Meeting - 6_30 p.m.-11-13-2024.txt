ABSENCE OF A BOARD MEMBER

Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice, as soon as possible, to the president or
superintendent of their inability to attend a board meeting. Board directors will participate in a roll call to
reflect attendance during the meeting for the record. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive absences from
regular board meetings without receiving respectful communication from the absent board member.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Network Data Cabling Improvements Project
Phase 2
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Kent School District maintains critical network infrastructure to provide connectivity and access to the
learning and administrative tools used by students and staff daily. School building network cabling helps
to ensure access to online services such as learning and management tools, instructional content,
student information systems, clock & intercom systems, and more.
To improve the aging network cabling, the first five elementary school buildings are scheduled for cabling
improvements starting July 1, 2025. This is phase 2 of a multi-phase project. (Phase 1, secondary

schools, was previously approved and is underway). Specific cabling improvements being performed are
detailed in the table below.
Improvement(s)

Benefit

New fiber optic cabling between all wiring closets
within each building (12 strand single-mode)

Establish higher speed network backbone
between sections of each building.

New Ethernet cabling to each wireless access
points (2 each category 6a)

Improve wireless network capacity and density
throughout each buildings learning and work
areas.

New Ethernet cabling to each clock/intercom unit
throughout each building (1 each category 6)

Install prerequisite data cabling for forthcoming
network-based clock/intercom improvements.

Per previous board approval, phase 2 & 3 low voltage electrical engineering services were obtained, and
a construction RFP was developed and published on 10/4/2024. Phase 2 construction bids are being
solicited using the districts competitive bidding process as outlined in KSD School Board Policy 6220
