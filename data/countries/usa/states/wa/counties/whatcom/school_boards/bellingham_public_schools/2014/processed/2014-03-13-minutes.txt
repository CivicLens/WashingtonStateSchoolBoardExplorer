BELLINGHAM SCHOOL DISTRICT
BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location
March 13, 2014, District Office Board Room, 1306 Dupont St., Bellingham, WA

1.2

Call to Order/Roll Call
Dr. Smith called the meeting to order at 6:03 p.m.
Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Ken Gass, Camille Hackler, Steve Smith (President);
Scott Stockburger, Superintendent Greg Baker, and recorder Ruth Rasmussen.

Audience
Quenby Peterson asked the board to take action in response to new Washington State
legislation that allows schools to maintain supplies of EpiPens for use in emergencies for
students who have life threatening allergies.

1.4

Superintendent’s Announcements and Report
Food Service Program
Dr. Baker introduced Mark Dalton, Director of Food Services, who gave an overview of
the district’s food services program and protocol relating to students who are unable to
pay for school lunch. Mr. Dalton provided the following statistics:
 Approximately 1,800 breakfasts and 4,200 lunches are served daily; of these,
about 89 percent of breakfasts and 67 percent of lunches go to students enrolled in
the free and reduced lunch program.
 Shuksan Middle School serves about 80 dinners on Tuesday and Thursday
evenings each week. Because Shuksan is designated a high-needs school,
government assistance is provided for this program. Age 18 and under are not
charged for the meals; adults pay $4.
 School meal programs are currently self-sustaining and funded through revenues
from lunch purchases and federal government reimbursements. This is not a
federal or state mandate, but something the district has opted to do. The annual
cost of the program is $3.4 million, with approximately $1,000 written off each
year in unpaid accounts.
 A system is in place to call parents/guardians if an account is in arrears. Food
service staff members use discretion and respect in serving students who have a
negative balance in their lunch account. Additionally, most of the elementary and
middle schools have “share tables” in the cafeterias where students place
unwanted food for others to use.

Highly Capable Learner Program
Dr. Baker said the Highly Capable Program Committee has completed its work and has
forwarded its recommendations to him for review. He introduced Michelle Kuss-Cybula,
Director of Teaching and Learning, who presented an overview of the Highly Capable
Program and the committee’s work. Ms. Kuss-Cybula described how the program will
likely change in the coming year as the result of a consultant review and recently enacted
state legislation mandating that all districts provide highly capable programs and services
for students in grades K-12. She expressed appreciation to the Highly Capable Program
Committee for its work and noted that the committee had good representation from
families and district staff.
Budget
Dr. Baker said the district will receive information soon on how the recently completed
legislative session will impact the 2014-15 district budget. A survey relating to the
district’s Priorities for Progress has been sent to staff and families for input. Executive
Team members will review survey results and factor this information into overall
considerations as the budget is formulated. The final budget proposal will be presented to
the board in June.
Promise K
Promise K allows the district to address an opportunity gap in kindergarten between
students who have attended preschool and those who have not been able to access
preschool learning opportunities. Starting the week after spring break, we plan to serve
students who have turned five since the fall and who meet certain other criteria, including
not currently being enrolled in an early childhood program.

The Board discussed the following consent agenda items:

Architect
 Assistant Superintendent Ron Cowan reviewed in detail the process for the selection
of the architect for this project and answered questions from the board.
2.14: Monitoring Report EL-8 – District Calendar
 Dr. Smith stressed the importance of using best practices when considering the length
of the academic year. In response to a question regarding the benefits of year-round
school, Dr. Baker said this type of change could not be made in isolation; ideally, it
would have to be done state-wide or at least county-wide. Dr. Baker added that the
district will continue to explore the potential for lengthening the school day or the
school year, similar to many districts throughout the state and country.
Other discussion relating to the school calendar included a review of start and end
times; bus transportation considerations; the impact of collective bargaining on the
calendar; and recent state legislation relating to the 24-credit graduation standard
starting with the class of 2019.
Board members agreed to adjust the agenda so that Item 4.1 would be considered next.
