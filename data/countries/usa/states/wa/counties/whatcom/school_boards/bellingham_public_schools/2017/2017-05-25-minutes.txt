POLICY GOVERNANCE
Ends 1, 2, 3 Monitoring Reports (combined): Dr. Mike Copland, Deputy
Superintendent, and Brian Rick, Director of Research and Assessment, discussed the
monitoring report and data set and responded to questions from the board. Highlights of
comments/questions:
 The Bellingham Promise is alive and well in the district’s communications
and practices. One can hear references to it within our schools, within the
community, and beyond. The Promise website has received 28,000 unique
page views this year to date.
 The district’s four- and five-year graduation rates are up significantly over the
past six years.
 The restorative justice model has made a positive impact, as evidenced by the
significant reduction in suspensions in recent years.
 A major focus for system work going forward will be social emotional
learning.
 More work will be done to find ways to measure students’ success once they
are out of high school.
 Could future reports capture the impact and extent to which students are
participating in clubs and other extracurricular activities?
 Can we determine if a lack of technical skills in the lower grades is presenting
a barrier to better test results?
