Garden Coordinators for a round table discussion. The discussion was centered around the questions.

2. What is your vision for enhancing our work together?
3. What suggestions do you have for working together better?
Carrie Clendaniel from Jefferson Land Trust gave a brief explanation on how the Land Trust has been
involved in the schools. She highlighted that in the future they are interested in focusing on teaching the
students about forest health, forest inventories and forest management. The Land Trust looks forward to
doing 2-4 field trips per year with the students. They are collaborating with other local organizations
such as NOSC to provide our students with more resources and learning opportunities. Clendaniel
shared that The Land Trust is excited about the future and looking forward to growing the partnership
with CSD.

Chimacum Backpack for Kids; Traci Harris highlighted how they are involved in the schools. Their focus is
to provide nutrition for kids over the weekends. They are a team of volunteers that get together at the
food bank kitchen and pack bags full of nutritious foods and snacks for students to take home for the
weekend. Harris pointed out that they deliver about 120 bags each week to the schools. They would love
to keep doing this and have been grateful for all the help they have been getting from the staff. One
request was to help get the word out about this program to the parents and teachers. Apart from the
food bags the organization supports our preschool program by donating towards preschool tuition.
CSD garden coordinators, Valerie Randall and Katie Jagger gave a brief description of what their role in
the CSD garden program is. They highlighted they meet with students every week making core curricular
connections. The kids have been learning about different plants, vegetables, and fruit. Randall
highlighted they have been learning how to make different dishes with what they grow in the gardens.
They both expressed their gratitude for all the support they have been getting from the teachers and
staff.
