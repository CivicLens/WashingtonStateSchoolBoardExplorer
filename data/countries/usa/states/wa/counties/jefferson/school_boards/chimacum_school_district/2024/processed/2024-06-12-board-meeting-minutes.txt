SIP Presentations
Chimacum Primary School Principal Sarah Walker presented school improvement plans highlighting
reading, math, behavior, attendance, and family engagement data. She presented MAP data on Literacy
and compared the results from 2023-24 Fall to 2023-24 Spring. Walker also presented DIBELS data
showing growth. Walker confirmed she is working on improving the attendance numbers, it has been a
challenge, but she believes as she gets more acquainted with the families, she will be able to get them
the help they need to have the students attend school regularly. She explained the processes in place
now to mitigate this. Walker also highlighted the community engagements, she thanked the AAUW
volunteers that have been in the schools everyday helping our students. She pointed out the events that
the school hosted throughout the year expanding the community engagement.
Chimacum Elementary School Principal Leigh Schwartz presented school improvement plans highlighting
School Goals: Mathematics, English Language Arts, School Culture and Climate, and Community
Involvement. Schwartz presented MAP data for math, reading and science comparing Fall MAP data to
Spring MAP data. He stressed the students are thriving at science as they are doing hands on work,
which the students show a major interest in. Schwartz explained the disciplinary issues have decreased,
and pointed out the times the most disruptive behavior happens is when closer to school holidays. He
and his team have been helping the students mitigate these behavior problems, but he highlighted there
is still more work to be done in that area. He also highlighted the activities that the school offers the
students, as well as a list of activities our community can engage in.
Pi teacher, Jamie Jensen presented school improvement plans for Pi. She highlighted the program has
fifty-five students in 23-24 Spring and nine out of the ten seniors are graduating this year. They have
already received eight applications for the next school year and more inquiries. Jensen expressed her
enthusiasm for Mr. Orr joining the Pi team, she believes he would be a great fit and his creativity will be
beneficial to the students. Jensen presented MAP data for math, reading and language. She pointed out
there are some challenges in every area, but they have been finding ways to cope with them and move
forward. She highlighted the student successes they have had this year, finding students activities that
they love to do as well as setting them up with career paths they are genuinely interested in following.
Chimacum Jr/Sr High School Principal Ryan Stevens presented his SIP using his presentation to the State
Board. He explained what the state board expectations were when school goals were selected. He
stressed that all the building staff participated in the process. He noted CEE Perception Data, NWEA
MAPS Data, SBAC Data, Classroom Based Assessments and Teacher Observations were used to develop
these goals. He went on to talk about the graduation rates and future planning and learning for the staff
setting down foundations to achieve the goals set for the school. Stevens explained the staff will work as
a collaborative team and take collective responsibility for student learning rather than work in isolation.
