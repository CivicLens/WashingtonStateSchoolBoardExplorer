AGENDA ITEM:

Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Uncollectible Nontax Revenue

AGENDA ITEM:
This request for approval of uncollectible nontax revenue only pertains to inactive students who
have left the district and have fines/fees assessed prior to January 1, 2018.
Board Policy 6119, Uncollectible Nontax Revenue, states that When the district has exhausted its means
for collections, the district may declare the amount uncollectible. In such case, the superintendent or his
/her designee shall request from the school board to write off uncollectible amounts in excess of $500.
District staff is recommending that debts remain on the districts records for a period of 6 years, in
accordance with RCW 4.16.040, which addresses the statute of limitations for accounts receivable in
Washington state. Eligible non-student debts may be referred to an outside collection agency, once the
district has exhausted all means for collections, at which time, the district is recommending removal of
these amounts from the districts balance sheet.
As stewards of public funds, the district recognizes its fiduciary duty to recover value from lost or
damaged property purchased with tax-payer funds. The district additionally has the responsibility to
charge fees for items or services that are not part of the basic program of education provided by the
district. This duty is grounded in the Constitutional prohibition against gifting public funds, and the
statutes delineating the programs, services, and items that districts must provide for free, versus those
that would be considered elective or extracurricular, such as many ASB (Associated Student Body)
programs, school lunch for certain students, or certain preschool programs. The districts fee practices
have undergone considerable review by the Board and staff in the past four years. The district does
retain some latitude and discretion in how fines and fees may be appropriately and reasonably collected
and/or satisfied, including alternatives for families facing economic obstacles.
With passage of House Bill 1176 (2021), RCW 28A.635.060 was amended to prohibit school districts
from withholding a students grades or transcripts in response to the student damaging or losing school
property, or property belonging to a school contractor, employee, or another student. RCW 28A.225.330
was also amended to remove reference to a corresponding requirement that information about any fines

or fees related to a student losing or damaging property be provided to the school when a student enrolls
in another district.
With board approval, the fees and fines below will be removed from the districts student ledgers. It is
important to note that this recommendation does not extend to all fines and fees, and in some cases, the
class fees in question are no longer charged by the district.
$53,975.21 comprises only the unpaid fines and fees of inactive students, assessed before
January 1, 2018. Unpaid fines and fees for inactive students assessed after 01/01/2018 are not included
here.

The fines and fees brought for review today are not all the outstanding debts in the district, and
additionally exclude the outstanding debts in the Child Nutrition Services Program, which is
governed under a separate regulatory framework, including theHunger-Free Students Bill of
Rights Act.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 1: Preparing all students to be Global Citizens
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
This action means the potential loss of revenue (uncollected debt) of $53,975.21 to replace or repair the
items. Past practice suggests that the district would collect a relatively modest percentage of this total
debt, regardless of todays recommended action.
RECOMMENDATION:
It is recommended that the board of directors authorize the standard of retaining debts for six years,
unless otherwise referred to an outside collection agency, and authorize the superintendents designee to
waive the collection of the designated outstanding fine and fee debt, as itemized herein, for the period
specified.

Boardroom Audio Video Upgrade
AGENDA ITEM:
Kent School District's boardroom audio and video systems have been consistently experiencing
significant issues, including microphones intermittently cutting in and out, HDMI inputs not working and
various other components showing their age and becoming unreliable. Except for the upgrade in 2021, all
current audio components are outdated as they were installed over a decade ago. Additionally,
replacement parts are no longer in production, creating an inability to maintain and repair as needed.
Background:
Despite previous improvements, no major revision to the entire system has taken place. Necessary
upgrades have been made recently as follows:
Digital audio processing unit and modern control panel (2021)
Two cameras and a video switcher for a more engaged experience for livestream viewers, in
addition to increased accuracy, and transparency for meeting archival purposes (2022)
Equipment from the 2021 and 2022 upgrades will be fully incorporated in the proposed audio/video
system upgrade.
Summary:
Below is a summary of three quotes provided (the full quotes are attached to this item), each written
through the lens of sustainability and equity especially for meetings with increased attendance such as
with students and community partners. The quote details are as follows:
1. Avidex (Current Provider):
Quote Amount: $80,123
Total: 9 wireless microphones (3 new), AV over IP
2. Dimensional Communications (Selected Quote):
Quote Amount: $65,633
Features include but not limited to: 14 wireless microphones (8 new), 6 new dais wired
microphones, an Assistive Listening Systems (ALS) for hearing impairment, Third PTZ
camera for enhanced audience participation, AV over IP
3. Evergreen Technologies:
Quote Amount: $119,438
Features include but not limited to: 14 wireless microphones (8 new), 6 new dais wired
microphones, an Assistive Listening Systems (ALS) for hearing impairment, Earset Mic
Option with Lapel Mics, Updated Wall Ports in the back of the board room, Third PTZ
Camera installed behind Dias, Split 2 Mic Install w/ Capsule at Lectern, AV over IP
Recommendation:
The Technology department has carefully considered and selected Dimensional Communications as they
are the most cost-effective and offer features to significantly enhance the functionality and accessibility of
our boardroom.
BOARD GOALS:

Executive Summary of 2023-2024 to 2029-2030 Capital Facilities Plan

AGENDA ITEM:
The Capital Facilities Plan is updated each year to include capacity, enrollment forecasts, a current list of
major capital improvements planned by the District, and calculation of proposed impact fees based on
updated student generation rates for both single family and multi-family dwellings in the community. The
District adopted 2022-2023 Capital Facilities Plan suspended impact fees due to decrease in enrollment
and the Districts current capacity, even with additional programs. The 2023-2024 plan will also result in
no collection of impact fee for the 2024-2025 school year. This executive summary is being provided to
the Board in advance of proposed adoption of the Plan, which is scheduled for the June 26, 2024, board
meeting.

A draft version of the Plan is scheduled for a technical review by the King County School Technical
Review Committee on June 7, 2024. After this technical review, and after it is approved by the Board, the
plan will be transmitted to be included in the update of the Comprehensive Plans of King County and
impacted cities, including Kent, Covington, Renton, Black Diamond, Maple Valley, SeaTac, and Auburn.

The required State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) documents and public notices have been filed with
the 14-day comment period in accordance with statute. No adverse environmental impacts are foreseen
with the implementation of this Plan.
