OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
January 18, 2024 – Options High School, 2015 Franklin St., Bellingham, WA.
Call to Order/Land Acknowledgment:
Mr. Benjamin (President) called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. He acknowledged that
this meeting is being held on ancestral homelands of the Lummi people and Nooksack
tribe.
Roll Call:
Present: Directors Douglas Benjamin (President), Camille Diaz Hackler, Jennifer Mason,
Scott Ritchey and Katie Rose, Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder, attending via
Zoom).
Audience:
• Maria Ugas talked about her appreciation for Native American education.
• Suzanne Gray talked about the importance of Treaty Day.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Dr. Baker wanted to acknowledge our incredible team who did a great job responding
to a broken pipe at the District Office located on Dupont Street. Many worked
throughout the MLK holiday weekend for long days and into the early morning hours
of Tuesday to ensure we had internet and network services working to have school.
Their work is very much appreciated.
• We continue to deal with snow and ice, balancing the risk of having school buses on
the road and students walking to school. It can be difficult to make the decision to
cancel school the night before, but it’s important for many families to know in
advance so they can make alternative plans for childcare, etc.
• A District Office sprinkler line froze and burst in the early morning hours of Sat., Jan.
13, 2024, which resulted in the ceiling above the board room to cave in and flooding
throughout the building. Dr. Baker shared photos of the damage. There was also some
water damage at Bellingham High School from a broken pipe, impacting several
classrooms. We expect the new District Office to be completed within a couple of
months, and contractors are working hard to get the new facility up and running. The
District Office staff will be assigned to workspaces in schools across the district, and
the schools have been graciously moving things around to identify great spaces for
District Office staff.
• Many district leaders volunteered to help at the City of Bellingham’s cold weather
shelter over last weekend.

Martin Luther King, Jr. assemblies took place in schools last week, and a big event
was held at Sehome High School on Monday, the Martin Luther King, Jr. federal
holiday.
The athletic building at Bellingham High School is nearly complete.
Many of our students attended a Treaty Day film festival at the Mt. Baker Theatre
field trip this week.
The Cascadia Daily News published a letter from the Whatcom County
Superintendents regarding the upcoming levies that all Whatcom County districts
have on the Feb. 13, 2024 ballot. The letter outlines how critically important the
levies are to the students in our communities.
With January being School Board Recognition month, each school board member
was presented with gifts, which included gift boxes made by students in Bellingham
High School’s Engineering Technology class.

Dr. Baker responded to questions from the board.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
GP-7.2 – 2023-24 Annual Board Agenda, Revised – general review.
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Mason enjoyed the visit to Northern Heights Elementary earlier this month. It
was great to hear appreciation for the lessons regarding Treaty Day, and she
appreciates the district going above and beyond with these lessons. She liked hearing
from Northern Heights students about the time they spend with their Squalicum High
School buddies. She expressed huge appreciation for staff this week with all the
crises. She knows it’s difficult to make decisions about weather, but safety is
important.
• Mr. Ritchey shared his appreciation for the great work over the past week, handling
the waves of crises, with values on display. He appreciated seeing the work firsthand.
• Ms. Rose also knows how much goes into the decision of whether to cancel school
and asked the board for a round of applause for Dr. Baker and his excellent team.
Intentional communication is very much appreciated. Regarding the visit to Northern
Heights, she commented that the large class sizes of the fifth-grade classrooms, with
31 and 32 students, are evidence of the reality of our state’s broken funding system.

She appreciated the educational component of Treaty Day and is grateful that we
have the developed curriculum.
At the Northern Heights visit, Ms. Diaz Hackler discovered that a teacher at Northern
Heights was one of her high school classmates. She appreciates all the work that went
into the school board appreciation gifts.
Mr. Benjamin enjoyed the Northern Heights visit and thinks the school visits are a
treat. It was remarkable to see the soft start firsthand. He encouraged all board
members to attend WSSDA’s equity conference. It was decided at the last WSSDA
DA-1 meeting, in Mt. Vernon, that the April 27 regional meeting will be held on San
Juan Island. The board may be interested in attending the regional meeting and
holding its spring retreat on the island.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
There is evidence of specific actions taken by the superintendent and staff to comply with EL-1,
which are substantial. The efforts to treat the district as a “whole” with cross-team
communications is particularly forward thinking.
There is clear evidence, as we have seen in past years, that the superintendent and his team
actively monitor required and best practices policies, updating policies actively as needed, and
communicating those to staff, including 96 policies where no WSSDA model exists.
There is evidence of building relationships with many organizations, entities and individuals.
It is clear there has been an emphasis on avoiding silos and solving problems across departments.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
None identified.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
This is an area where the superintendent well exceeds expectations and has consistently done so
during his years with the district.
The list of board updates is extensive, including emails, in person meetings, roundtables, linkages
and study sessions. There is consistent communication to the board on a VERY wide range of
topics (also, this report is a good reminder of how many reminder-worthy things go on during the
year!).
At the same time the communications are well chosen and not overwhelming. They include
opportunities for the board to receive input from students, our schools and the greater community,
which are consistently well-planned and precisely meet the requests of the board.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
None identified. The board would be very pleased to have the superintendent continue the current
level of performance in this area.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
DB:
• Impressive steady year-after-year growth in grants applied for and received.
• Strong evidence of continued and new community partnerships.
• The district continues to use a robust and transparent budget development process.
• The annual Budget Book continues to be a remarkable document that both educates and
outlines the moral nature of the district budget.
CDH:
• The board continues to be impressed with the amount of work and care that goes towards
applying for grants to benefit the district. It exemplifies being a good steward of the district
budget.
• The last audit results were commendable, and the board will monitor the next audit starting
soon. This shows that BPS is at the top of surrounding districts.
JM:
• As usual, use of a long-term budget planning process that includes many voices.
• Record number of grants applied for and received!
• Grants secured for specific areas of need and interest, mental health and sustainability.
• Excellent work with local partners to result in new space(s) for Community Transitions.
• Increased collaboration, communication, and strategic problem-solving in many areas to
address budget reductions due to decreased State funding, inflation, and other factors.

Continued near-term and long-term planning to deal with inconsistent and insufficient State
funding.

The total number of submitted grant applications and number received reflect a substantial
increase over the year prior. More importantly, the total grant dollars received, and the
number of successful applications indicate success in our endeavors. Our commitment to
mental health, wellness, and sustainability I believe reflect the values of our community well.
This is an exceptional outcome.
The grant which will improve testing for hearing loss is an excellent step forward and
consistent with our core beliefs and creating new efficacy in equity for our system.
The district work to refinance our bonds reflects thoughtful stewardship of taxpayer money
and is a tremendous outcome. This effort should reinforce community trust in the district’s
efforts, especially important as we bring two essential renewal levies to the voters in 2024.
The budget process includes an impressive number of budget updates and communication
efforts. This work is incredibly important for community awareness and broader community
interest. Excellent work planning and communicating during a challenging planning cycle.
Great to see the continued year-after-year growth in both grant applications and awarded –
especially for priorities like mental health and sustainability.
Budget book is always an impressive work – highlighting how intentional and thoughtful the
district is in this process. Appreciate such a strong commitment to transparency and
connecting the budget to our values.
Given the state’s inadequate funding system, I deeply appreciate how intentional the district is
in thinking both near and long-term with planning.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
DB:
• There is evidence that district facility/transportation management was well maintained in spite
of an almost 15% reduction in associated staff due to budget cuts, and the addition of new
facility technologies (e.g., building entrance protocols). Even with these cuts, APP scores
remain roughly the same as last year (2022), and in many cases exceed those in 2021.
Numerous outside agency observers have confirmed this.
• The pace of facility replacements/upgrades continues to be impressive.
• There has been a commendable amount of safety training and process improvement during
this reporting period.
• The continued use of a Sustainability Advisory Committee and a Climate Action Plan show
clear focus and efforts working toward high standards of energy use and conservation. All
recently constructed facilities well exceed WSSP sustainability standards.
CDH:
• The board is impressed with the results showing the district exceeded WSSP standards for
new buildings.
• Great job on conducting a waste assessment at five different schools. It will be interesting to
see what happens in the years ahead.
JM:
• Always impressed with how much is done “behind the scenes” to keep our buildings warm,
welcoming, and functioning for our students, staff, and families.

Continued work to managing the differing needs of newer/older buildings and technologies.
Major initiatives and projects able to be completed through our bonds.
This report really demonstrates that various benefits of newer buildings, including for energy
efficiency.
Appreciate exceeding environmental design standards at our newer buildings, including the
new District Office which is not required to meet the standards at all.
The magnitude of facility demands clearly necessitates expert care and maintenance. It is
commendable that the district has identified a pathway to managing the complex mix of
properties and some very old facilities with fewer staff due to the budget challenges of the
district. This responsiveness to budget realities undoubtedly comes with significant challenges
for the teams involved. The district management of and staff response to these challenges is
excellent.
Transportation safety is of key concern for all parents with children who are supported by
district transportation and the accomplishment of our district’s achievement for ‘outstanding
bus inspections’ is an important part of that safety puzzle. The team’s work to make that
happen for the 12th consecutive year is excellent service to the community.
The district’s work to improve sustainability and impact on our environment is also a critical
new challenge for the organization but squares precisely with a broad base within the
community. In many cases I would expect this work necessitates more analysis, effort, and
dedication as we have new opportunities for management of the district facilities. That effort
is greatly appreciated and truly reflective of the ‘embracing change’ and dedication to
flexibility reflected in The Bellingham Promise. It is great to see progress in this area.
Cyber risk has become existential for many organizations and managing that risk essential for
leaders. It is prudent to consider cyber risks carefully and consider the mix of operational
activities and insurance to manage potential impacts. It is great to see the district investing in
management of those risks as they could seriously impact our ability to fulfill the mission of
the district otherwise.
Never ceases to impress how complex it is to keep our facilities safe, warm and welcoming—
deeply appreciate the work given how much time our community’s children spend in these
spaces. Would be a huge job just given the number of buildings and facilities, but is that much
more impressive given the range of age and needs of different buildings and marked budget
challenges and reduced staff.
Continued to commitment to sustainability is exciting to see. Heartening to know how
committed the district is to this work and not just paying lip service to these ideas.
Appreciate facilities exceeding sustainability standards—not only is this what the community
needs and students deserve, we also see how much more efficient and cost-effective newer
buildings are.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
DB:
• Thank you for providing additional information to the EL-9 report regarding the specific data
on reported staff injuries, including those staff injured by students. Due to the anomalous
nature of the numbers for this past reporting period, we would appreciate watching them over
the next year and hopefully getting a clearer understanding in the next EL-9 report.
