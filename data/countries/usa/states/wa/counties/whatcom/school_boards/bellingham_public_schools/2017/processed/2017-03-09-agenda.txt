to the Transportation Vehicle Fund in connection with the
purchase of new school buses. As Superintendent, I have

resolution.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent, Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
Attached is a resolution approving a temporary transfer of funds of up to $1,300,000from the Capital Projects Fund to the Transportation
Vehicle Fund as allowed by WAC 392-123-135. The district has placed an order for new and replacement school buses that will be delivered
by August 1, 2017, so that these buses can be brought into service at the start of the 2017-18 school year. The interfund loan is necessary
because the timing of revenues doesnt match the timing of the purchases. Revenues that will fund these purchases are received in August
(state bus transportation amount)and in October and April (local tax levies), whereas the buses will be purchased by the beginning of
August. The loan will be repaid within a year of issuance, interest will be paid on the loan at the Local Government Investment Pool (LGIP)
rate that would otherwise be available to these funds, and both funds are solvent.

2.6 Authorize Negotiations for Transportation Garage
Improvements Architect

Meeting :

Mar 9, 2017 - Regular Board Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the request outlined below in connection with
the selection of an architectural firm for the transportation
garage replacement project. As Superintendent, I have
reviewed this information and fully support the proposal to
begin contract negotiations with Zervas Group Architects.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director of Capital Projects and School Facilities.
Explanation of Issue:
As part of the bond approved by voters on November 5, 2013, the existing Transportation Garage will be renovated/replaced with a new
facility.This project will require architectural services.
RCW 39.80.040 governs the process for selecting architects. One option is to select a firm from an annual general request for statements of
qualifications from firms interested in providing such services.
After reviewing the statements of qualifications from firms who responded to our annual request, I believe Zervas Group Architects is best
qualified to provide services for our Transportation Garage Improvement project. Zervas has past successful experience and knowledge of
these types of projects including the Whatcom Transportation Authority (WTA) Transportation Garage Project. This will serve the district well
in that many of the design elements we need are similar to the ones incorporated into the WTA project (service bays, hydraulic lifts, fluid
distribution and storage, parts and tool storage, etc.).
I am seeking your approval to begin contract negotiations with Zervas Group Architects for services related to the Transportation Garage
Improvement project.
