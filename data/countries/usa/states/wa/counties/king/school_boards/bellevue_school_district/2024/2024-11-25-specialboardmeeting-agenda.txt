Special Board Meeting
Date: Monday, November 25, 2024
Time: 12:30pm
Location: Microsoft Teams
PURPOSE: To consider ratification of the Tentative Agreement (TA) between the Bellevue School District
and the International Union of Operating Engineers 302 (IUOE) to update the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) applicable to the Districts Custodians. The membership of IUOE ratified the same on
November 6, 2024 and the Board was scheduled to consider ratification at is November 14, 2024 Regular
Business Meeting. However, the item was removed from the proposed Agenda prior to the meeting so as
to provide sufficient time for the Board to receive a report on School Improvement Plans and a Financial
Update. Given the Thanksgiving holiday, the Board does not have another Regular Business Meeting
until December. Holding this Special Meeting to consider ratification will allow for the new CBA and its
corresponding salary schedule (if ratified by the Board) to be implemented in a timely manner, respecting
that the IUOE membership ratified the same this month. Please see the Agenda Item Details for further
information.
