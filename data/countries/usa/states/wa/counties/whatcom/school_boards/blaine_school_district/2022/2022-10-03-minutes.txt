  3. Public Comment
A. Public Comment
There were no requests for public comment at this meeting.
  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Monthly Reports
Monthly school administrator reports for Blaine schools were attached to the agenda for review by the board. There were no presentations at this meeting which was originally scheduled to be in Point Roberts.

President Thomas asked about the status of enrollment at the kindergarten level, and discussion followed regarding the district's decision to combine classrooms at Blaine Primary School due to kindergarten enrollment being 43 FTE below the budgeted level. Two instructional staff members on contract for the year will be utilized to address the district's current shortage of teacher substitutes. Dr. Granger explained that the transitional kindergarten program beginning in January is expected to increase enrollment. There was discussion regarding possible reasons for the significant drop in enrollment, including recent news reports that birth rates nationwide have been declining, as well as the choice some families have made to keep children home for an extra year following COVID. Director Creydt asked for clarification about the district's expectation to plan a conservative budget in 2023-24, and Dr. Granger explained that the budgeted enrollment will be lowered and new teachers will only be added later when it is known they are needed. President Thomas asked if the smaller class sizes could have been retained if there were not a substitute shortage, and Dr. Granger explained why that would be unsustainable in the long run. The average kindergarten class has been in the range of 19-21 students for the past 5 years, and if there were not a current shortage of teacher substitutes, the district would have reassigned the two instructional staff members to provide support in other areas. Discussion continued and Dr. Granger stated that the decision to combine classes that were too small is a function of the same protocol that would require the addition of a class when class sizes became too large. Fluctuations in grade level enrollment have historically resulted in staffing adjustments as the cohort moves through the lower grade levels. Dr. Granger reiterated that, if reductions in staffing are needed, it is the district's desire to accomplish that through attrition and not through layoffs.
  B. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided an enrollment report which was attached to the meeting agenda. There was no presentation at this meeting which was originally scheduled to be in Point Roberts.

Director Creydt asked when results would be available from the August 30 staff survey, and Dr. Granger explained that he expects that to be reported to the board at the October meeting.

Director Creydt asked for clarification about the district-wide enrollment deficit, and discussion followed. Total district enrollment is below budgeted level which represents more than $700K in lost funding.

Director Creydt asked about the district's status on acquiring property for a school in Birch Bay. Dr. Granger explained that Ms. Porter has been working diligently on coordinating the feasibility study for potential properties that have been identified. He reminded the board that construction of a school facility must follow passage of a bond to support it which may be challenged by current low enrollment rates. It is possible that the property purchased by the district with currently available funds could be utilized in other ways, such as athletic fields, until a school facility can be built. The district's decision-making on property feasibility has been driven by community feedback. Discussion continued regarding the timing of the feasibility studies which Dr. Granger hopes will be done by the end of the calendar year, depending on third-party availability. Dr. Granger clarified that the board would have to take action to put a bond measure before voters and then it would have to be passed in order to start construction of a new school in Birch Bay.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report, attached to the agenda, on revenue and expenses through the month of August. There was no presentation at this meeting which was originally scheduled to be in Point Roberts.
  D. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
The district's Substitute Job Fairs on September 19 and 26 were successful and resulted in 30 new substitute applications.
Updates to Procedure 3205P Sexual Harassment of Students Prohibited do not require the board's approval and were attached to the agenda for board review.
In anticipation of a future school in Birch Bay, the board will be asked to adopt Policy 3131 Student Attendance Area Transfers. Dr. Granger referenced the importance of being clear with families, in advance of building a new school, that students will be expected to attend in the area where they are zoned. The new policy will include recommended language from WSSDA as well as local language based upon examples from other districts in the county.
Dr. Granger recommended that the board discuss parameters for the naming of facilities at a future meeting in order to develop clear procedures for that process.
In preparation for the legislature's upcoming budget session, which will address issues related to McCleary, the following initiatives were reviewed.
WASA/WASBO/WSSDA has recommended phasing in certain Prototypical School Funding Model enhancements. Under the state's current formula, the district is considered to be "over staffed" in nursing positions, and that formula needs to be fixed.
OSPI's budget recommendations were reviewed. Dr. Granger commented on the influx of federal money related to COVID which has delayed the impact of McCleary-related funding issues that have been on the horizon for several years. The last time the state pumped more money into the education system, it was eaten up by salary increases. Dr. Granger described the new "classified administrator" employee category which has previously not been funded separately. Dr. Granger is advocating for the state to give more consideration to experience in the salary funding formula for both instructional staff as well as for para-educators.
Travel plans were mentioned for the annual WSSDA Conference which starts on November 17 in Spokane.
