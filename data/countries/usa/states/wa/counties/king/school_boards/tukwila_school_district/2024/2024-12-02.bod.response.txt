Representatives Upcoming Board Meeting Dates Careers District Calendars District Overview Enrollment Staff Directory Superintendent Non-Discrimination Statement Budget Information Board of Directors The Tukwila School District Board of Directors is made up of five elected members of the community who are responsible for the oversight and governance of the District's operation, including the following areas: Vision Structure Accountability Advocacy Student Representatives Vision The Board, with participation by the community, shall envision the future of the school district's educational program and formulate goals, define outcomes and set the course for the school district. This will be done within the context of respect for our diverse community, and with a commitment to educational excellence and equity for all students. Structure To achieve the vision, the Board will establish a structure, which reflects local circumstances and creates an environment designed to ensure all students have the opportunity to attain their maximum potential through a sound organizational framework. This includes employing a superintendent, developing and approving policies, formulating budgets, setting high instructional and learning goals for staff and students, and nurturing a climate conducive to continuous improvement. Accountability The Board's accountability to the community will include a system of continuous assessment of all conditions affecting education, including assessments for measuring staff and student progress towards goals. The public will be kept informed about programs and progress. Staff and Board training will be provided to ensure continuous improvement of student achievement. Advocacy The Board shall serve as the key advocate of students and their schools. The Board shall work to advance the community's vision for its schools, pursue the District's goals, encourage progress and systemic change, and ensure that students are treated as whole persons in a diversified society. Student Representatives The Tukwila School Board has two student representatives who sit at the board table and participate in each meeting. Each June, a new junior from Foster High School is selected for a two-year term to replace the outgoing senior representative. Student representatives act as a two-way conduit, making sure their peers voices are represented at the district level and bringing back important board business to their school so that students are aware of what s happening. Communicating with the Board If you would like to share feedback or a concern with the board, you are welcome to communicate with the entire board via email. While members of the community are welcome to email board members or the superintendent independently, the best way to ensure all board members simultaneously receive the same information is to use the email address below, which sends an email to all board members at once. All emails sent to the school board, or any district employee, are subject to public disclosure. tsdboard@tukwila.wednet.edu If you're interested in addressing the Board during a meeting, please visit the Public Comment page for more information about the various ways you can submit a statement or sign up to read a statement.
