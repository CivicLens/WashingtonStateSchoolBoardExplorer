Call to Order/Roll Call
Board President Douglas Benjamin called the meeting to order at 6:17 p.m. Present:
Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler, Steven Smith,
Superintendent Greg Baker, and recorder Ruth Rasmussen. Mr. Benjamin said Ms.
Peterson previously notified him that she was unable to attend tonight’s meeting.
Audience: no audience presented.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
 Dr. Baker said tonight’s audience includes administrators from area school
districts who are participating in an internship program as part of their candidacy
for initial superintendent certification at Western Washington University.
 Attendance Areas PreK-12 Standing Committee: Dr. Baker updated the board
on the committee’s work to date. Families who live in neighborhoods impacted by
proposed changes to attendance areas have been invited to parent input sessions
taking place tonight at Birchwood Elementary School and on March 9 at Cordata
Elementary School.
 Options High School (OHS) Construction Project: Options students are
currently housed at Bellingham High School. Ron Cowan, Executive Director,
Capital Projects and School Facilities, reviewed the construction timeline and
answered questions from the board. Dr. Baker said the district is committed to
opening the new school at the start of the 2017-18 school year for a variety of
reasons, including the following:
o Anticipated attendance area adjustments, along with the implementation of
the new 4x8 schedule, will result in increasingly challenging space
limitations if the two schools continue to be housed under one roof.
o New OHS staff must be hired at the start of the school year for new
specialty programs such as aerospace manufacturing, engineering
manufacturing, and applied physics.
o Our GRADS programs at Sehome and Squalicum high schools have
reached capacity. A third GRADS program at OHS must be up and
running at the start of the school year to provide necessary space for
students and their children and to meet licensing requirements for the
preschool program.

o Having OHS students and staff relocate to a new building several months
into the school year will be academically and culturally disruptive.
In other matters relating to the OHS project, the district has begun the process for
a Remedial Action Grant application of up to $400,000 in connection with soil
contamination at the construction site.
Update on Snow Days: A number of strategies are currently under consideration
to make up snow days. One potential scenario would require submission of a
letter to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for waiver of
two of the six days missed to date in the current school year. The board reviewed
a draft of the letter to OSPI. Ms. Bashaw then made a motion, seconded by Dr.
Smith, confirming board approval of the proposed plan as outlined in the letter to
OSPI requesting a two-day waiver from the 180-school day requirement without
the loss of state funding. Unanimous affirmative vote.
College Bound Scholarship Program: Our middle schools were the recipients of
Gold Star awards from Gov. Jay Inslee’s office in recognition of last year’s
exemplary sign-up rate (81.8 percent) of eighth graders. The award went to
schools that exceeded the statewide signup rate of 71 percent.
2017-18 High School Graduation Planning Guide and Course Catalog: Dr.
Baker distributed catalogs to each director.
