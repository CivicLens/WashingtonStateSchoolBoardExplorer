Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

From: Shawn Lewis
Subject: Financial Update
Attached are the Budget Status Reports for all funds as of the end of May 2024, along with
charts and data showing our monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund cash
balance.
Enrollment is generally flat, but we did have a larger than normal decrease in June in both
Running Start and non-Running Start categories. This results in roughly $70,000 less funding
this year than projected last month. This is offset partially by the approximately $50,000 we
won’t be required to pay Pierce College for Spring Quarter Running Start enrollment.
Our General Fund Balance as of May 31 was $3.25 million. This is slightly higher than
anticipated due to Federal Impact Aid payments being sent by the federal government earlier
than usual and local levy collections higher than normal for May. Early collections help cash
flow – but will decrease the funding that comes in later in the year – so this does not indicate a
change to the expected end of year balances. Expenses were higher than a “typical month” in
May due to our payment of Winter Quarter Running Start costs. This was expected, and we
expect to pay for Spring Quarter in August 2024.
General Fund cash balance as of the end of April is $3,214,113.
As discussed previously, we will need a budget extension for the current year to address the
higher Running Start costs. The budget extension request will be for an additional $1 million in
expenses – however, based on current trends we will likely only need to utilize roughly
$250,000 of the capacity. The rest is to ensure early grant expenditures can be made during
the summer without delay.
We will be transferring some of the capital projects levy funding to the debt service fund in
anticipation of paying of the bonds next December. The money will be fully invested to ensure
it grows in value to allow for full repayment of the LGO.
No other items of significance to report at this time.

planning year, however the district has already started progressing toward grant goals. This

School for Lexia PowerUp, 18 district teachers are enrolled in Dyslexia Certification coursework
through Pacific University, before and after-school literacy labs have begun at Cherrydale, Chloe
Clark, and Saltar's Point schools, multiple professional development opportunities have already

updates/adoption, professional development, additional literacy labs at the K-5 level, and
supplies to implement UFLI.
Dr. Valleries introduced Bianca Kirby, a teacher at Cherrydale Primary School, who shared about
the amazing impact the UFLI program has had on her teaching. It is an explicit, symptomatic
system. The confidence her students now have in reading and writing is more than she has seen
in her previous 19 years of teaching. She shared UFLI is not just for struggling readers, but also
helps on-level students read above and beyond their grade level while exceeding writing
expectations as well. She shared she hopes the district will adopt the UFLI curriculum.
Dr. Valleries then introduced Sasha and Jackson Leyva. Jackson is a student in Ms. Kirby's 2nd
grade class at Cherrydale. Mrs. Leyva shared about the impact the UFLI program has had for

participating in a literacy lab.
Director Tinsley shared how exciting it is to see teachers, parents, and students so passionate
about the UFLI program.

program in action. He also appreciates how UFLI has made the program so affordable for the
school district.
Chair Scott shared this program is helping our students at just the right time, and shared the
adage, "if you can't read, you can't succeed."

teachers. She was inspired by the stories shared tonight.

B. Approval of UFLI Curriculum
Dr. Valleries shared about the University of Florida Literacy Institute (UFLI) Foundations
program, which is an explicit and systematic program created to introduce students to the
foundational reading skills necessary for proficient reading. UFLI Foundations program will
supplement the district's current ELA curriculum.
The Instructional Materials Committee recommends that the Board adopt UFLI Foundations as
an explicit and systematic phonics program for K-2 as a supplement to our current ELA
curriculum. Materials purchased for the 24-25 school year will utilize DoDEA 2023
funds. Anderson Island materials for the 24-25 school year will be purchased out of Title II
funds. Professional Development for staff will occur in August of 2024 and will be paid for
utilizing DoDEA 2023 funds.
Director Tinsley made a motion to approve UFLI Curriculum, Director Lewis seconded the
motion, and the motion passed (4/0).
Chair Scott clarified the costs of implementing this curriculum will be minimal. Dr. Valleries
confirmed this, sharing how costs will be paid through DoDEA grant funds, and explaining the
costs are so low because UFLI is a non-profit organization, whose goal is to help students read,
not make a profit.
Director Rohrer questioned how training will work. Dr. Valleries explained staff from University
of Florida will have in-person training, books will be ordered tomorrow, and an implementation
team will be working as side-by-side coaches in our classrooms.

Chair Scott shared the following statement from Dr. McDonald: This is such an important step in
allowing all kids in our district to learn to read. The science backs it as helpful for ALL students
and it can help to close the achievement gap we see. Reading is the golden key to learning in
traditional public schools- since most of what we do after 3rd grade is based in textbooks and
writing. Employing this curriculum in our schools can also help decrease other gaps that are
created with some students who have the means to hire private tutors to employ science-based
reading education and some who never have that access. I'm so proud of our district for making
this step. Thank you to Laurie for her tireless efforts to obtain funding- and thank goodness UFLI
has an incredible and affordable curriculum. I'm really excited to see where this takes our
students.
Director Tinsley asked about other area districts using the program. Dr. Valleries shared it is
taking the school district world by storm and becoming very popular.
C. Capital Facilities Plan Draft
Shawn Lewis shared district staff has prepared the 2025-2030 Capital Facilities Plan for school
board and community review. Following a 14-day SEPA notice period and review by the Town of
Steilacoom, City of DuPont, and Pierce County, the board will be asked to consider the final plan
at their regularly scheduled June school board meeting.
The plan this year incorporates new studies on student generation rates and enrollment
projections. Those studies are included in the board’s background materials.
Also included in this year’s updated plan are impact fee calculations that address statutory
changes regarding impact fees. Specifically, the plan now calls out specific types of residential
units where no fee is collected, and provides for a discretionary reduction for certain fees.
The Capital Facilities Plan is shared with the Town of Steilacoom, the City of DuPont, Pierce
County and the greater SHSD community. This plan will be adopted by reference as a part of the
local jurisdiction’s Comprehensive Plan for purposes of identifying whether school facilities are
adequate to serve existing and proposed new development.
No action is necessary tonight. Action will be required at the June 12 Regular Board Meeting.
Director Rohrer asked how many town homes may be a part of the plan. Mr. Lewis shared he
can get an estimate of that information for the board. The impact fee is assessed at time of
occupancy permit.
D. Election of WIAA Representative
Director Rohrer nominated Director McDonald to serve as the WIAA Representative for the next
year, Director Tinsley seconded the motion. No other nominations. Director McDonald elected
to the WIAA Representative position for one year. (4/0).
E. First Reading of Policy 5161 Civility in the Workplace
Dr. Weight shared Policy 5161 Civility in the Workplace. This is a new policy established by the
Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA). The intent of the policy is to prioritize
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

Page 5 of 7

Packet page 81 of 173

an environment that is safe, civil, and grounded in both orderly conduct and mutual respect, to
contribute to a quality educational environment for students.
Director Lewis made a motion to move Policy 5161 Civility in the Workplace to a second reading,
Director Rohrer seconded the motion, and the motion passed (4/0).
Director Tinsley asked about the policy section it is in (Personnel). Dr. Weight shared this policy
would be relevant for any events on district property. She shared her research shows other
districts host this policy in the 5000s. One option would be for the district to have this same
policy in multiple sections, referencing other policy numbers back to Policy 5161.
Director Rohrer shared about hostility occurring in other school districts, and she believes this is
a good policy to adopt. Her concern is that she doesn't want this policy to lead to a knee-jerk
reaction. Something should be added into the language to grant grace and understanding.
F. Board Goal - Professional Learning
The Board established professional learning goals for the 2023-24 school year based on the
most recent Board self-evaluation process. This agenda item is a “standing” item at our Regular
Board Meetings to provide an opportunity for Board members to discuss their goals.
Chair Scott shared he will be attending the WSSDA Regional Meeting in Carbonado. No other
board directors will be attending. Chair Scott will take notes and bring back materials to share
with the other directors.
X. BOARD COMMUNICATION
• The board received communication from a group of Anderson Island Elementary parents
regarding safety and communication.
• The board also received communication from a community member regarding music at the fast
pitch field.
XI. ANNOUNCEMENTS
• SHS Principal Jake Tyrrell shared with the board he would like to recognize Janelle Mock for
living SHS's staff ideals of Fostering Resilience and Reciprocating Grace. Janelle elevates student
voice as well as any and you'll see her student's work highlighted all over the school. Just this
year she has had a student visit Washington DC in recognition of art created under her tutelage,
as well as spearheading an idea to recognize our native students through their stories and
cultural art pieces. Students of all abilities are engaged and smiling in her classroom. With
Janelle, our kids express themselves and explore elements of their young adult lives that they
are often unable to reveal in other classrooms. She is engaged with our community and
supports student activities across our entire district.
• Chair Scott shared SHS graduation is June 5 at 6:00 p.m. at St. Martin's University.
• Dr. Weight shared Kiwanis will receive the WASA Region 111 Community Partner Award on
Friday morning. She shared about all the wonderful ways Steilacoom Kiwanis supports the
district.
• Director Lewis thanked Pioneer Middle School for banning cell phones for students during the
school day. He will share an article with the board showing the benefits of making this decision.

From: Laurie Vallieres, Executive Director of Teaching & Learning
Re:
MLL/ELL Program Annual Report
Date: June 12, 2024
According to School Board Policy 2104 and in accordance with the obligations outlined the ESEA
Consolidated Grant Application, it is the responsibility of the school district staff to furnish and
document, via board minutes, a report containing the following details.
In our school district, students are identified for enrollment purposes using the OSPI Home Language
surveys, which are completed by parents. Additionally, students undergo testing using the WIDA
Screener, which serves as a state screening and achievement tool for assessing English language
proficiency.
Objectives of the Program:
● To establish a cohesive program that supports students in acquiring English proficiency and achieving
academic success.
● To provide personalized assistance to each learner through case management.
● To aid students in meeting the standards set for mandatory assessments.
● To equip students with the necessary skills and reduce their reliance on support, facilitating a smooth
transition into the general education program.
Description of the Multilingual Learner (MLL) instructional program:
Our model is one of several approved by the state and operates as an Alternative Instructional Program
(AIP), focusing on English as a second language instruction to foster English language proficiency through
English-only support.
Currently, our MLL (Multilingual Learners) population represents 31 different languages, which is an
increase compared to the 27 languages observed during the 23-24 school year and more than double
from the 22-23 school year.
To cater to the needs of students and families, we provide screening, assessment, and instruction.
Additional support is offered to enhance students' English mastery, which ultimately contributes to their
success in other academic subjects.
During the 2023-2024 school year, our district employed two full-time teachers in the program: Jody
McDonald, who worked with the schools in Steilacoom, and Patricia Kadel, who worked with the schools
in DuPont. Their roles involve close collaboration with teachers, counselors, and families, while also
providing assistance to MLL students.
To ensure appropriate support, all schools ensure that MLL-eligible students are assigned to teachers
who possess the necessary qualifications and experience in strategies to assist our students. We
continually enhance the capacity of our general education staff to meet the needs of MLL students
through targeted professional development. The Teaching & Learning Department is informed of any
supplementary materials or professional development opportunities required by the schools. When
necessary, the MLL teacher requests additional materials in alternative languages and software that aids
communication and language acquisition. Student interventions are scheduled alongside core academic
instruction. Furthermore, students who have transitioned out of the MLL program within the past two
years are closely monitored as they independently progress in their academic development.

Packet page 89 of 173

High School
During the 23-24 school year, Steilacoom High School assigned our 34 Multilingual Learners (MLL) students to
advisory groups, where they were mentored by a teacher who holds an ELL endorsement (state certificate
code). These advisory groups convened on a weekly basis. As part of this arrangement, Mr. McDonald met with
the students during their regular advisory group meetings. Additionally, counselors assigned students to an ELL
endorsed teacher in a core subject.
Middle School
During the 23-24 school year, a total of 29 students qualified for MLL services, and an additional 8 students
were in the transition phase after recently exiting the program. The MLL teacher collaborated with school
counselors and teachers to identify suitable times for students to receive support services.
The MLL teacher maintained close weekly collaboration with the ELA general education teachers to determine
the students' requirements and the most appropriate approach, whether it involved pull-out sessions, support
within the general education classroom, or online assistance.
For middle school students who were just beginning their MLL journey, they received support in the general
education classroom for a minimum of 30 minutes per day, twice a week during their ELA class.
Intermediate-level MLL students with strong oral language skills and foundational literacy abilities had
individual meetings with the ELL teacher twice a month, during their designated ELA block, with each session
lasting 10 minutes. These meetings focused on discussing learning strategies and monitoring progress
throughout the school year.
Elementary K-5
The MLL teachers collaborated closely with the general education teachers to offer resources and instructional
strategies in support of our 80 elementary MLL students within their general education classrooms.
Additionally, they monitored the progress of an additional 28 MLL transitional students. In order to provide
targeted instruction, the MLL teachers, along with a paraprofessional, conducted small group sessions within
the general education classroom for eligible students. These small groups, comprising no more than four MLL
students, focused on pre-teaching or re-teaching academic vocabulary and concepts aligned with the curriculum
and state standards. The sessions emphasized reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills.
The nature of instruction varied according to the individual needs of the students. At the beginning proficiency
level in elementary school, MLL students with the greatest needs received support either within the general
education classroom or through a pull-out model. They were scheduled for a minimum of three sessions per
week, lasting 30 minutes each. Intermediate proficiency level elementary MLL students, on the other hand,
received a minimum of 20-30 minutes of instruction within the general education classroom, twice a week.
To establish a baseline, all eligible elementary students participated in school-wide diagnostic academic
assessments in reading at the start of the academic year.
Professional Development and Program Development
The district has developed a professional development plan aimed at equipping classroom teachers with
instructional strategies, effective utilization of curricular materials, and a supportive mainstream program
model. Going forward, we will place increased emphasis on providing professional development support to our
general education teachers, as they play a pivotal role in supporting our MLL students throughout the majority

Packet page 90 of 173

of the school day. This deliberate effort aligns with our adoption of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and the
implementation of Enriched Core Instruction (ECI).
In June of 2023, the district conducted a one-day training session on Guided Language Acquisition Strategies
(GLAD) for teachers. This training took place at the end of the school year and saw participation from more
than 30 K-5 teachers and administrators. The largest group of participants came from Chloe Clark, the school
with the highest concentration of MLL students. As part of ongoing professional development, Saltar's Point
hosted a GLAD training session for all staff in August, followed by a subsequent training day for the entire staff
in October. Anderson Island, Cherrydale, and Chloe Clark also hosted a professional development day of GLAD
training in October of 2023 as well.
In late June of 2024, 30 participants from Pioneer Middle School and Steilacoom High School will also have the
option to participate in the GLAD training, creating strong vertical alignment of classroom strategies and
cohesive teacher knowledge.
Program objectives and changes for 2024-2025
● We will enhance the support for students in transition status by implementing more frequent
monitoring.
● Emphasizing Enriched Core Instruction (ECI) as an integral component of the MLL program,
integrated with other instructional support programs, and highlighting the expanded role of general
education teachers.
● Augmented focus on student learning growth, with a specific emphasis on productive language skills
such as writing and speaking.
● Maximizing the efficient utilization of school space to facilitate the delivery of services.
● Providing professional learning opportunities to the general education staff, fostering the sharing of
successful inclusive practices.
• Clustering groups of students for push-in inclusive classroom support in K-5.
● Implementing class period instruction at Pioneer Middle School and Steilacoom High School to
support Beginning and Developing language learners.

Program evaluation and fiscal report
The allocation of the $35,137 from state and federal programs, which included carryover from the 22-23 school
year, have been utilized for multiple GLAD training opportunities for the elementary staff at Saltar’s Point,
Chloe Clark Elementary, Cherrydale Primary, and Anderson Island during the 23-24 school year. An additional
optional training will be conducted on June 27th, 2024, benefiting the secondary teaching staff. Funds in the
24-25 allocation will serve to provide updated professional development to the current MLL staff and teaching
supplies.
Assurances that the district is legally compliant
Evidence of compliance with legal and policy requirements includes various aspects such as the selection
process, notification procedures, appeal process, and annual reporting.
To gather valuable feedback and insights for program improvements, the district administered an OSPIdeveloped parent survey via email and will continue this practice annually. The data collected from this survey
will be used to inform any necessary adjustments to the current program.
Every MLL family has the opportunity to meet with their child's MLL teacher at least once a year during the fall
conference period. These meetings serve as a platform to discuss the student's current progress and strategies
to enhance their development. Whenever possible, these meetings involve both the MLL teacher and the
general education teacher to establish a connection between state learning standards and language acquisition
goals. Moreover, MLL teachers maintain frequent communication with general education teachers and parents
throughout the academic year, addressing any areas of concern promptly.
Periodic meetings took place throughout the 22-23 school year involving the evaluator for the MLL teachers,
their assigned evaluators, and Student Services. These meetings serve as a platform to review student
progress, instructional support strategies, and assessment plans. For the 24-25 school year, the MLL program
will shift to the Teaching & Learning Department.

Highly Capable Program Annual Report
June 12,
2024

The Highly Capable Program (HCP) served 224 students from kindergarten through 12th grade during
the 2023-2024 school year.
HCP Program Goals:
● To expand academic and intellectual skills
● To stimulate intellectual curiosity, independence, and responsibility
● To develop a positive attitude toward self and others
● To develop originality and creativity
● To provide a coherent and rich program where students will complete independent
and cooperative projects
● To gain enriched learning through STEM curricula
● To expand the program in scope and content
● To connect with parents and partner with them in the development and monitoring
of the program
Description of the HCP instructional program:
Our school district identifies students through the universal screening of elementary grade students and
through a referral process. Parents or teachers can recommend any student for screening via the
district’s form within the annual spring referral window. The timeline for submitting referrals is in
March, with testing occurring in April and May. Parents are notified of results and eligibility vial mail by
the end of May. New to the district families may refer their students beginning in the last week of
August through September 13th with testing being completed by early October. Parents are notified of
results and eligibility via mail by mid-October. There is also a kindergarten referral window in December.
To be more inclusive of all families, students who meet the initial screening criteria complete further testing which
includes the CogAT test and the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. In addition, the Smarter Balanced Assessment
scores and/or i-Ready scores are considered as academic achievement indicators for placement determination.
The district’s target is to qualify and enroll students in the Highly Capable Program (HCP) at a number
equal to 5% of the district’s total K-12 student enrollment. For the 2023-2024 school year, the actual
percentage was 13.52% of total student enrollment, which is well above the target

Packet page 94 of 173

Instruction for grades K-5 includes a variety of enriched content, individual and group projects, direct
instruction, small group instruction, and some classroom based activities. Focus for the K-5 students
includes hands-on minds-on curricula, real-world problem solving, themed projects and presentations,
and use of instructional technology. New resources such as Generation Genius (science topics) and Math
Antics (math topics) are utilized to provide engaging activities and learning opportunities.
The middle school model includes a cohort class structure for the 6th graders in English and mathematics.
There are now offerings in ELA and mathematics for each of the grade levels and electives are designed
for STEM and are aimed at drawing in HCP students.
Students in grades 9-12 receive instruction in the Advanced Placement program and complete AP
examinations in the spring quarter of the school year. Career and Technical Education program
certification pathways are other enhanced programs that students can access. High School students in
HCP also have access to the Pierce County Skill Center programs and Running Start, where they can
spend half-days of instruction in areas of high-interest and vocational preparation.
Program evaluation and fiscal report:
For the 2023-2024 school year, the state has allocated $96,632 for HCP. This entire amount is dedicated to covering the
salary and benefits of the HCP teacher at 0.8 FTE. Other expenses such as curriculum, postage, and testing supplies,
including the universal screening of all 2nd, 3rd, and 5th grade students, are funded through the general fund.
Our HCP teacher has the opportunity to participate in training provided by the ESD, OSPI, and WAETAG.
They were also able to cross-train with the outgoing HCP teacher at the end of the previous school year
and during the beginning of the 23-24 school year.

The district started tracking HCP identified students in high school in 2016-2017.
*Three students in K-5 were in the Promise Program for 2021-2022.
Demographic Distribution and Comparison
The focus on diversifying the HCP population is a perennial priority for our program. Both our district
and the State of Washington have named the representative gaps and access barriers that exist. We are
consistently looking for ways to draw in students from all backgrounds, while maintaining the rigor and
high-engagement in the program. The plan for moving to a more representative distribution of our
student demographics in the HCP program include the following steps:

Packet page 96 of 173

● Implementing the values and practices of Enriched Core Instruction, which seeks to provide a
●

more inclusive learning environment for all students through access and support.
Expanding the referral criteria and screening tools to include creativity
(successfully implemented in 2018-2019)

● Screening all 2nd and 5th grade students using the CogAT screener and existing
assessments in the district to identify potential HCP students.

● Providing annual training to district teaching staff regarding the HCP referral process
Assurances that the district is legally compliant
The program staff communicates with parents frequently through group emails and/or ParentSquare and
at school-level events. The district also hosts a website for the HCP program including highlights.
The district’s plan to identify students is in compliance with School Board Policy 2190 and Procedure
2190P and the OSPI survey for funding. Evidence of the compliance with legal and policy requirements
include: the selection process; notification processes; appeal process; and annual reporting.
The district23-24
is also in
compliance
school
year,with
we the recent update in HCP law, which holds all districts accountable
for screening elementary students twice before the end of 6th grade. For the 24-25 school year, we will be
screening all 2nd graders and 5th graders to be in full compliance with new legislation in the spring.
Updates for the 23-24 School Year
In order to accommodate the expanding Highly Capable program in several grades which may include
3rd, 4th and 5th grade, Highly Capable services will be incorporated into the regular classroom setting
and provided by the classroom teachers. This approach will enable student projects to be directly
connected to the subjects they are studying in their regular classes. Grades in which smaller caseloads
occur will still receive pull-out services.
World language opportunities for eighth grade students at Pioneer Middle School will expand in the 2425 school year. For the first time, Pioneer is offering German I for high school credit.
Students at Steilacoom High School will have the opportunity to enroll in College in the High School
(CiHS) for dual credit in grades 9-12. This year SHS will be offering up to 14 opportunities in math,
science, and world languages for the 24-25 school year.

Board Meeting Date: __June 12, 2024______
Policy 5161 Civility in the Workplace – 2nd Reading
Strategic Focus Area
☐ Achieve
☒ Support
☐ Connect
☐ Plan
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Policy 5161 – Civility in the Workplace - was established by the Washington State School Directors
Association (WSSDA) as a model policy. Policy 5161 has been adopted by many school districts
around Washington State, as recommended by WSSDA.
At the Board’s most recent work session, the Board expressed an interest in implementation of a
civility policy, so staff researched the model policy series and is presenting this to you today for
consideration. The intent of the policy is to prioritize an environment that is safe, civil, and
grounded in both orderly conduct and mutual respect, to contribute to a quality educational
environment for students.
1st Reading was completed at our May 15 Board meeting and the Board was asked to review and
provide suggestions. Some language from the policy was recognized as being procedural in nature
so portions of the policy will be moved to a new procedure to accompany Policy 5161. WSSDA
does not have a model procedure; all language is captured in their model policy.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
It is the recommendation of the Superintendent to adopt Policy 5161.

Report prepared by:
Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

Packet page 109 of 173

Policy No. 5161
Personnel

CIVILITY IN THE WORKPLACE
The Steilacoom Historical School District board believes that a safe, civil environment of mutual
respect and orderly conduct contributes to a quality educational environment. Conversely,
uncivil conduct, similar to other forms of disruptive behavior, may interfere with an employee’s
ability to accomplish their work and a school’s ability to educate its students.
The board of directors commits the district in its entirety to the core value of mutual respect for
each person regardless of individual differences or characteristics. The district expects this value
to be manifested in the daily behavior of all constituents. When differences exist, stakeholders
will use clear, concise, and courteous communication with the goal of arriving at a goodwill
solution. Uncivil conduct on district property or at district-sponsored activities by school
directors, staff, parents, volunteers, contractors, or visitors is prohibited.
Expectations of Stakeholders (Board of Directors, Employees, Parents, Volunteers, Contractors,
and Visitors)
In support of this policy, the board of directors expects its members and all stakeholders to:
 Treat each other and students with dignity and respect;
 Exercise reasonable, good judgment in handling interpersonal disputes;
 Exercise respect, courtesy, and concern for the dignity and cultural background of others;
 Refrain from use of abusive language;
 Model respectful problem-solving;
 Reduce actions or behaviors that might provoke fear, anger, frustration, or alienation;
 Use clear, concise, and courteous oral and written communication to arrive at goodwill
solutions;
 Extend common courtesy to others such as saying please and thank you;
 Practice civility in all conversations and behavior;
 Be respectful of others even when in a disagreement;
 Address incivility when it is observed; and
 Seek to understand others’ points of view and cultural perceptions.
Definition of Uncivil Conduct
For the purposes of this policy, “uncivil conduct” includes but is not limited to, the following:
 Using vulgar, obscene or profane gestures or words;
 Using insulting or disrespectful nonverbal behaviors toward or in connection with
another;
 Taunting, jeering, or inciting others to taunt or jeer an individual;
 Raising one’s voice at another individual, and/or repeatedly interrupting another
individual who is speaking;
 Using personal epithets or slurs,
 Gesturing or behaving in a manner that puts another in fear for his/her personal safety,
including invading the personal space of an individual after being directed to move away,
physically blocking an individual’s exit from a room or location, or remaining in a
Page 1 of 2

Packet page 110 of 173

Policy No. 5161
Personnel
classroom or school area after a teacher or administrator in authority has directed one to
leave, or other similar disruptive conduct.
“Uncivil conduct” does not include the expression of controversial or differing viewpoints that
may be offensive to some persons, so long as (1) the ideas are presented in a respectful manner
and at a time and place that are appropriate, and (2) such expression does not materially disrupt,
and may not be reasonably anticipated to disrupt, the educational process. Nor does “uncivil
conduct” include regular supervisory-subordinate interactions, including but not limited to,
corrective action, discipline, unsatisfactory evaluations, plans for improvement, or probation.
Addressing Uncivil Conduct
Stakeholders are expected to:
 Calmly and politely caution or warn any speaker who is engaged in uncivil conduct. If
the conduct does not cease, politely end the conversation;
 Attempt to resolve differences with another employee first in a private conversation. If
that is not feasible or successful, request an appropriate administrator to conduct a private
conference with all parties of concern;
 Resolve personal complaints or grievances with a supervisor’s decision or action by
requesting a problem-solving conference with the supervisor or with the administrator’s
supervisor.
 Persons who observe or experience uncivil behavior have an obligation to intervene,
share their reflection with the offender about the impact of that behavior, or report the
uncivil behavior to a supervisor.
 Supervisors have an obligation to address reports of uncivil behavior.

Employees who engage in uncivil behavior may be subject to corrective action or discipline.
Retaliation for reporting allegations will result in discipline.

TAB 1 INTRODUCTION
The Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 (SHSD) has prepared this Capital Facilities Plan
(CFP) to assess the facilities needed to accommodate projected student enrollment at
acceptable levels of service, as well as a more detailed schedule and financing program for
capital improvements, over the next six years (2025-2030). The CFP is intended to be shared
with the Town of Steilacoom, the City of DuPont, Pierce County and the greater SHSD
community. This report assesses the following:
•
•
•
•

The anticipated growth within the District’s boundaries;
The anticipated school enrollment growth through the 2025-2030 planning period;
The new school facilities required to meet the needs of this expanding student
enrollment; and
As applicable, the school impact fee calculations based on the capacity projects
necessary to address growth needs.

Residential development has historically preceded any school construction and has never
progressed in an orderly and coordinated manner. Selection of school sites and the
construction of schools have generally followed the construction of new homes. This historic
process of school construction following residential growth has left a gap between available
space and the student population. As a result, schools have commonly become overcrowded.
Compounding the situation is the state’s historic and consistent underfunding of the State
Construction Assistance Program by using construction cost allocations and eligible area
estimates that are far below normal and reasonable levels. In addition, the required time to
acquire property, design facilities, acquire all necessary permits, and to construct facilities also
contributes to overcrowded schools.
Relief for overcrowded schools has primarily come from local residents who have supported tax
levies and bond issues. Voter approval of school levies and bond issues is becoming more
difficult as other interests vie for property tax dollars. In addition, many existing residents are
questioning the equity of having to pay the full costs of the educational facilities needed to
serve new residents. In an effort to overcome the perceived inequity of property tax supported
levies and bond issues, school districts have sought conditions upon development activity to
provide a share of the local financial support needed for the construction of school facilities.
This Capital Facilities Plan is designed to support the use of school impact fees as provided for
under the 1990 Growth Management Act. Therefore, this Plan consists of:
•
•
•
•

An inventory of the existing schools, support facilities and properties owned by
Steilacoom Historical School District No.1;
An enrollment history and projection for the 2025-2030 time frame;
An identification of the District’s current “level of service” with respect to capital
facilities;
A forecast of the District’s need for new construction, modernization, and new
construction-in-lieu-of modernization; and

2025-2030

Page 5 of 35
Packet page 117 of 173

•

A plan that will finance the proposed construction projects within projected funding
capacities and clearly identify sources of public money for such purposes. The CFP is
designed to support school impact fees authorized by Pierce County, as implemented by
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 and other municipalities that may collect
school impact fees on behalf of the District.

In addition, the CFP will also provide a basis for mitigation under the State Environmental
Protection Act (SEPA) or the State Subdivision Act.

Land/Parcel Holdings and Disposition

In 2010, the District purchased a 13.5-acre parcel (tax parcel identification No. 761500022
located immediately directly north of Steilacoom High School. In November 2013, the Board
passed Resolution 810-11-13-13 to approve the surplus of a 3.77-acre portion of that site, and it
remains for sale. It is the intent of the District to utilize a portion of this site for additional
parking and athletic fields. The timing of this expansion is subject to the successful passage of
a bond proposition.
In July 2022, the Board approved the purchase of a 10-acre elementary school site in the City of
DuPont located on McNeil Street adjacent to Marshall Circle. The District intends to construct
the next elementary school on this site. The timing of this expansion is subject to the successful
passage of a bond proposition.
The District owns a 14.71-acre site located on Manchester Place within the City of DuPont.
This 14.71-acre site in DuPont was intended to serve as the location for a planned new school.
The Board declared this property surplus subsequent to the acquisition of the McNeil Street
property in 2022. The 14.71-acre site is currently available for sale.

History of Capital Facility Planning and Construction

To meet increasing population and provide a sturdier building, the Town of Steilacoom
approved in 1913 the construction of a new brick structure at the cost of $15,000.
During the early part of the 1990’s, about a dozen portable classrooms were placed to
accommodate the growing enrollment at Cherrydale Primary School, Saltar’s Point Elementary,
and Pioneer Middle School. After the Town of Steilacoom placed a moratorium on the number
of portables that could be sited, the District held public information meetings designed to
inform residents about the critical situation. When the bond election was held in 1996 to
approve general obligation bonds of $38,000,000, voters rejected it. A second election, held in
the following year was approved.
In 1997, voters approved by over 60%, a proposition for construction and improvements to the
District’s elementary schools and high school but rejected a second proposition to build a new
middle school.
Instead, the old Steilacoom School serving as Pioneer Middle School underwent an extensive
retro-fit to make the building earthquake safe. In addition, the cafeteria was remodeled and
enlarged and the gymnasium floor was replaced. The results of that retro-fit were
demonstrated during the February 28, 2001 earthquake. A portion of Proposition #1, or
$2,003,000, was designated for technology—computers, software and related equipment.
Following approval of the 1997 Capital Facilities Bond, plans were started for work on
Cherrydale Primary School, Saltar’s Point Elementary School, and Anderson Island Elementary
SHSD Capital Facilities Plan

School. To accommodate school-age students in the DuPont community, ground was broken in
fall 2000 for a new elementary school. Chloe Clark Elementary School was dedicated in August
2001 and 180 students were enrolled for the following school year.
On May 17, 2005, District voters approved Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 to issue
$55.9 million dollars in general obligation bonds to finance a 6-year construction program.
The District received approximately $17. 1 million dollars in state match dollars to assist in
funding.
The 2005 bond projects included:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Completing Phase II of Chloe Clark Elementary School
Building a new middle school
Building an addition to Steilacoom High School
Modernizing the existing portion of Steilacoom High School
Building a new multi-purpose room at Anderson Island Elementary School
Completing other priority renovations/modernization projects

Bond sales were executed in two phases: June 2005, $22 million dollars and July 2006, $33.9
million dollars. The 2005 bond projects are complete.
The board passed in November 2012 Resolution 787-10-24-12 to approve the addition of a
modular building containing two classrooms to be placed at Saltar's Point Elementary to
accommodate enrollment growth. The two classrooms are now in place.
In 2008, the Board of Directors gave the Citizens Advisory Committee the task of exploring
options regarding the buildings that make up the old Pioneer Middle School site. The
Committee’s recommendation included consolidation of all SHSD administrative offices into the
1918 building. The District converted the 1918 Building into an administrative building in
August of 2014 which has enabled all of the District’s administrative staff to be housed in one
building.
In the fall of 2016, the Board of Directors discussed the development of a comprehensive
facility improvement plan for the District. It adopted a community based process that included
board presentations, listening sessions, and a community based committee. The committee
provided a set of recommendations to the Board of Directors in October 2018 and finalized
their recommendations in November of 2018. The committee recommendations included:
• Increasing facility capacity at each school level,
• Construction of a maintenance/transportation facility, and
• Special program spaces to meet the needs of students and the community.
In October 2022, the Board of Directors resolved to place a bond measure before voters in
February 2023 that would have:
• Built an elementary school in DuPont, addressing capacity issues at all elementary
schools within the district;
• Constructed an expanded performing arts center at the high school;
SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Packet page 124 of 173

•
•
•
•

Provided an additional athletic field and a covered stadium at the high school;
Increased facility capacity at the middle and high school;
Improved traffic safety and flow at all schools; and
Addressed ongoing facility safety and security needs for students.

Voters narrowly defeated the bond measure in February 2023 and again in April 2023. The
board intends to re-engage the community in broad based process prior to placing another
bond issue on the ballot. In November 2023, voters approved a capital and technology levy to
address some of the more emergent capital needs that could be funded through a levy without
a significant increase in the overall tax rate within the district.

Future Capital Facility Plans

The District’s projected enrollment growth is anticipated to be greatest at the elementary level
over the next six years. Elementary schools are also impacted by increased special education
needs and other special programs. Modest growth is also expected at both the middle and high
school.
A significant factor of the projected enrollment growth is directly related to additional planned
housing in the Old Fort Lake Subarea in DuPont. A new development is in the planning process
which includes between 2,750 and 4,000 housing units. Developers have indicated that the
housing units would be added over a period of 6 years, but the exact timing depends on a
variety of external factors. Demographers and city staff have indicated that the complete
development is more likely to occur over a 10 to 20-year period. Enrollment projections
anticipate the housing additions over a 10-year period.
To meet these capacity needs, the Board envisions the need for another school for K-5 students
in DuPont. If a new elementary school is not constructed, the District would need to add
additional classrooms at Chloe Clark as an interim planning measure. In July 2022, the Board
approved the purchase of a 10-acre elementary school site in the City of DuPont located on
McNeil Street adjacent to Marshall Circle. The District intends to construct the next elementary
school on this site. Discussions are underway with developers who intend to build multifamily
housing in the City of DuPont regarding additional school sites and other mitigation measures
that may be required, which could impact the location of the next elementary school
Subject to voter approval, the District intends to begin construction of this school during the six
year planning period of this Capital Facilities Plan.
The District will also consider other alternatives to address enrollment growth including but not
limited to adding modular classrooms at existing schools within the District.

TAB III STUDENT ENROLLMENT TRENDS
1.

DISTRICT GROWTH

Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 has reviewed historical demographic trends and
actual enrollments. The combined student population from the Town of Steilacoom, the City of
DuPont, and Pierce County is expected to result in an overall increase in student enrollment
due to increased residential growth within these communities.
Using in-school building enrollment figures, the District’s elementary school enrollment (grades
K-5) grew from 966 students in 2003 to 1,305 students in 2023. During that same period, the
Middle School (grades 6-8) student enrollment grew from 529 students to 745 students.
Overall student enrollment for grades 9-12 increased from 675 students in 2003 to 785 FTE
(headcount of 913 students) in 2023. Fall 2023 enrollment figures show continued long-term
growth at the elementary and secondary levels, though the most current years have been
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The District is monitoring stabilization of enrollment
following this impact.
The District implemented the following grade configuration model to address actual and
projected growth of the elementary school student population:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.

Anderson Island Elementary School:
Cherrydale Primary School:

Grades Pre-K-3rd
Grades Pre-K to 3rd
Grades Pre-K to 3rd

This grade configuration model may change once a new elementary school is operational to
allow elementary students in DuPont to be served within DuPont.

2.

ENROLLMENT AND PROJECTIONS

The Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) provides enrollment
projections based on the “Cohort Survival” method. This method of enrollment projection uses
historic patterns of student progression by grade level to measure the portion of students
moving from one grade level up to the next cohort or grade. This ratio or survival rate is used in
conjunction with current birth rates as a base for statewide enrollment projections. The OSPI
system is useful, but has obvious inadequacies in representing the unique growth conditions of
individual school districts. Historically, OSPI projections in growing school districts tend to
underestimate the actual student enrollment growth. Furthermore, the OSPI projections do
not wholly anticipate new students from new development within the District. As such, the
OSPI projections are considered conservative. In addition, recent enrollment anomalies due to
the COVID-19 pandemic make the OSPI projections fairly unreliable for predicting near-term
future enrollment growth.
SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Packet page 127 of 173

School enrollment growth and distribution over the next six years in Steilacoom Historical
School District will be influenced by several factors. A primary factor will be overall population
growth in the District.
The District is using a modified cohort survival projection for purposes of this Capital Facilities
Plan. The cohort projection was prepared by a consultant and considers historic growth trends,
future building plans and availability, birth rates, as well as economic and various other factors
that contribute to overall population growth. The modified cohort survival rates provide
projections that balance between achieving recency and stability.
Most school districts in the Puget Sound area and across the state experienced enrollment
decreases recently with remote learning and uncertainties related to school instruction. The
SHSD enrollment decrease in 2020-21 was larger on a percentage basis than many other local
school districts. It may take an additional year for enrollment and the associated increases in
student population to return to the prior trend. Because the District updates this CFP on an
annual basis, adjustments will be made annually as needed if COVID 19 assumptions are
incorrect.
The District engaged an outside demographer to conduct a demographic study for the 20252030 Capital Facilities Plan update. This demographic study used a cohort survival model with
adjustments for new housing. There were several alternative forecasts provided and the
District is relying on the demographer’s preferred forecast in the report. The preferred forecast
is based on birth counts, birth forecasts, grade level enrollment trends, and assumptions about
the number of students likely to be added from new home construction over time. For
purposes of the modified cohort survival projection, the demographer’s preferred forecast uses
a six-year average of continuing grades to balance the cohort projections between periods of
decline and increase.
The housing component of the forecast assumes that the District will see a substantial number
of new housing unites added over the next decade. Most of this is related to a project in the
Old Fort Lake Subarea in the City of DuPont – which alone is expected to add about 3,000 units
between 2025 and 2035.
In Steilacoom, a new masterplan community is expected to add residential units within the
Cherrydale attendance area. The types of residential units and timeline for construction has
not been finalized.
The following tables provide the District’s historical enrollment data and the projections by
grade level through the 2029-30 school year.

TAB IV LEVEL OF SERVICE
1.

INTRODUCTION

The Growth Management Act (GMA) requires that school districts provide “level of service” or
“school capacity” data as a component of their Capital Facilities Plan (CFP). The GMA was
developed, in part, to help ensure public services, including schools, necessary to support
development will be adequate to serve said development at the time the development is
available for occupancy and use, without decreasing current service levels below locally
established minimum standards. In other words, each public service needs to clearly define
their service level so that service level can be maintained in the face of new development.

2.

DEFINITION

The “level of service” is based on the number of classrooms available at each school and the
desired average class load. Inherent in the level of service are the types and amounts of space
required to accommodate the District’s adopted educational program. The educational
program standards which typically drive facility space needs include grade configuration,
optimal facility size, class size, educational program offerings, as well as classroom utilization
and scheduling requirements.
In addition to factors that affect the amount of space required, government mandates and
community expectations may affect how classroom space is used. For example, State
requirements related to full day kindergarten and reduced class sizes impact the level of
service. In addition, traditional educational programs offered by school districts are often
supplemented by non-traditional or special programs such as special education – resource and
self-contained, special education 18-21-year-old transitional program, English Language Learner
(ELL), Title I, Learning Assistance Program (LAP), music education, highly capable, special
education preschool, computer labs, career and technical education, etc. These special or nontraditional educational programs can have a significant impact on the available student capacity
of school facilities. For example, the District currently has approximately 425 students
(approximately 13% of its total student population) participating in Special Education Programs.
Variations in student capacity between schools often result in special or non-traditional
programs offered at specific schools. These special programs require classroom space, which
can reduce the permanent capacity of some of the buildings housing these programs. Some
students, for example, leave their regular classroom for a short period of time to receive
instruction in these special programs. Newer schools within the District have been designed to
accommodate many of these programs. However, older schools often require space
modifications to accommodate special programs, and in some circumstances, these
modifications may reduce the overall classroom capacities of the buildings.
District educational program standards will undoubtedly change in the future as a result of
changes in special programs, class sizes, grade span configurations, use of new technology, and
other physical aspects of the school facilities. The school space inventory will be reviewed

SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 19 of 35
Packet page 131 of 173

periodically and adjusted for any changes to the educational program standards. These
changes will also be reflected in future updates of this Capital Facilities Plan.
The District does not consider portables as being ideal instructional space for students and/or
staff members. By design, portable classrooms separate their occupants from the rest of a
school’s student body and/or staff members. In addition, the increased enrollments that
portables afford may exceed the optimal size of the “core” facilities of the permanent
building(s); such spaces as the gymnasium, the library, the restrooms, the main office, and the
food service facilities.

3.

SUMMARY

The Growth Management Act (GMA) requires that school districts provide “level of service” or
“school capacity” data to support requests for impact fees from residential developers. With
respect to public schools, the “level of service” is a quantifiable measure of the capacity
available to support the instruction of students.
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 has elected to define its “level of service” in terms of
each student’s share of the District’s permanent school facilities, with reference to the District’s
standard for average class load and identification of classrooms available for regular instruction.
The level of service (LOS) is dictated by the amount of space required to accommodate the
District’s adopted educational program. The LOS will change as the District changes its
educational program and it must be reviewed and modified periodically.
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 has adopted an organization that houses
kindergarten through fifth grade in elementary schools, sixth through eighth grade in middle
school, and ninth through twelfth grade in high school.
The District has adopted a traditional calendar beginning in late August or early September
(prior to Labor Day) and ending in mid-June, and a traditional daily schedule with academic
classes beginning in the early morning (between 7:35 a.m. and 9:05 a.m.) and ending 6.5 hours
after the start time. Although the District continues to study alternate organizations, calendars,
and schedules, the District believes the adopted organization is educationally sound and
reflects community values.
The District’s educational program includes individual and small group work, as well as full class
activities. Portable classrooms, which are neither intended for nor function as long term
educational space, are excluded from the level of service calculation. Portables are considered
adequate only for supplemental programs and interim housing.
The capacity for each facility is established by multiplying the regular classrooms available by
the District’s standard for average class load (the “Standard of Service”). Spaces used for
special program needs are excluded from the definition of regular classrooms. Core facilities
and special use facilities are compared to classroom capacity to confirm that facility capacity is
not limited by limitations in core facilities.
The District’s adopted Standard of Service is as follows:

TAB V THE DISTRICT’S CONSTRUCTION PLAN
1.

INTRODUCTION

From district to district, it is common to find variations in the grade level configurations, class
size requirements and instructional programs depending upon a local community’s educational
philosophy and the needs of the students to be served. Such variations between districts do
impact the design and the cost of newly constructed school facilities.
In late 2016, the district began a planning process with a Capital Facilities Advisory Committee
made up of community members, staff, district officials, students, Town of Steilacoom and City
of DuPont representatives. The Committee began their work in 2018. The purpose of the
Steilacoom Historical School District’s Facilities Advisory Committee (FAC) was:
•
•

•

Establish a long-term Capital Projects Plan
Recommend short- and long-term solutions related to the District’s deferred
maintenance, educational adequacy of schools, safety and security, future plans and use
of district property; and
Consider a future capital bond proposition.

The Capital Facilities Advisory Committee was presented data to study and evaluate the overall
condition of district facilities to identify and prioritize potential facility modifications,
replacements, additions and/or closures to best enhance student achievement opportunities,
and support the ongoing economic development and a healthy community. This data included:
•
•
•

THE NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM

The ability to move forward on the construction of any new school facility in the Steilacoom
Historical School District is dependent on many factors. First, the District needs to have local
funding available to pay for the cost of new school facilities. Normally, school districts secure
the majority of their local funds through the sale of general obligation bonds, as approved by
the qualified voters of their districts. The authority to issue and sell such bonds rests in the
Constitution and laws of the State of Washington, including RCW 28A.530.010 and RCW
84.52.056.
The State of Washington has set forth recommended site size standards, as defined in WAC
392-342-020. Specifically, for an elementary school, the minimum standard is five (5) acres plus
SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 23 of 35
Packet page 135 of 173

an additional one (1) acre for each one hundred (100) pupils of a school’s maximum enrollment.
For junior and senior high schools, the minimum standard is ten (10) acres plus an additional
one (1) acre for each one hundred (100) pupils of a school’s maximum enrollment. These
recommended acreages provide space for the school building(s) and the appropriate support
facilities such as play fields, athletic facilities and parking.
Of particular importance to Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1, is the eligibility for State
School Construction Assistance. Such State assistance is used along with local funds to pay for
the cost of new school facilities. However, State monies cannot be used to purchase school
sites, to make off-site improvements and/or fund those specific items spoken to in WAC 392343-120. The formula for determining the exact amount of State funding assistance a district
can receive is set forth in WAC 392-343-020.
To address capacity needs, the District plans to construct a new elementary school in the City of
DuPont. The District has completed the conceptual design stage for this school but the
District’s voters will need to approve a bond measure to fund the construction of this school.

3.

SUMMARY

To accommodate enrollment growth, Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 completed the
2005 Capital Improvement Program which benefitted four schools. The completion of Phases II
and III to Chloe Clark Elementary School resulted in a student capacity increase from the
original 175 student capacity. The 2,865 square foot multipurpose building at Anderson Island
Elementary was added to accommodate up to 40 students. Pioneer Middle School, which can
hold 775 students, opened in August 2008. The addition and modernization of the existing
Steilacoom High School was completed in 2009. Steilacoom High School can now hold 1,025
students.
Currently, Elementary Schools on the mainland are all over capacity based on Service Standards
(see page 22).
To address projected long term growth in the District, the District plans to construct a new
elementary school in DuPont within the six year planning period of this Capital Facilities Plan.
The District may also add portable facilities as needed to provide interim capacity for
elementary grades.

TAB VI THE DISTRICT’S FINANCE PLAN
1.

INTRODUCTION

The Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 clearly recognizes the long-term value of capital
facilities planning. The execution of the 2005 Capital Improvement Program, discussed earlier
in this report, helped address the District’s need for permanent facilities to accommodate
students from new housing developments.
The District’s long-planned modernization of its older facilities (Cherrydale, Saltar’s Point, and
Anderson Island Elementary Schools), construction of a future elementary school in DuPont,
and the addition of modular classrooms is dependent on a means of financing modernization or
new construction. The costs associated with new construction and modernization identified in
the District’s Construction Plan and anticipated state and local funding are presented in Tab 5.
The District uses an impact fee methodology that is based upon the Pierce County school
impact fee ordinance.
In this Capital Facilities Plan, based on current enrollment projections and the need to construct
a new school to meet capacity needs related to growth, the District is requesting school impact
fees.
The District’s Funding Plan identifies the specific funding sources, amounts of funding, and the
unique relationships that exist between funding sources for the projects spelled out in the
District’s Comprehensive Plan.

2.

COST FACTORS

Factors: A number of factors influence the total cost and, specifically, the local share of any
new school construction project. The major factors that impact the cost of new school
construction are as follows:
1.

The per acre cost of school sites will vary considerably from district to district. In
general, the more urban the district tends to be, the costlier the school sites.

2.

The acreage of available property and the use ability of acreage will not always match
the preferred school site sizes.

3.

The proximity of needed utilities (i.e., water, sewer, electricity, etc.) and roadways to a
new school site are oftentimes a significant cost variable.

4.

The nature of the instructional programs housed in school facilities drastically impact
the cost of those facilities. The square foot cost of senior high schools is almost always
higher than elementary and middle schools. The square footage costs of middle schools
are usually higher than elementary schools. Specialized facilities for Vocational and
Special Education programs can also increase construction costs.

SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 25 of 35
Packet page 137 of 173

5.

The posture of the local governmental planning agencies (i.e., City or County) will affect
such items as off-site street improvements, landscaping, street signaling, and signage,
etc.

6.

The “bidding climate” at the time a new school project comes on line is terribly
important. Normally, the less construction work available the more competitive the
general contractors become and vise-versa.

7.

The experiences and competence of the lowest bidding and general contractor and their
major subcontractors can also impact the final cost of any new school project.

8.

The State’s “funding assistance percentage”, as determined in accordance with the
formula set forth in RCW 28A.525.166, establishes the relationship between the local
and state funding of any new school construction project.

9.

The enrollment projection provisions of the State’s “space allocations” determine just
how much area of a new school facility will be eligible for State School Construction
Funding Assistance. Building a new school (i.e., elementary, middle, senior high)
without full “unhoused” eligibility increases the amount of local funds that have to go
into a project.

10.

The State funding assistance formula also impacts the level of state financial assistance.
See WAC 392-343-060.

Site Acquisition: The first major expense of any new school construction project is the cost to
purchase the site. Property acquisition cannot be funded with State School Construction
Funding Assistance. Land costs are strictly a local school district expense.
In addition to the location, site size and availability to utilities, other factors can also impact the
cost of school sites. For example, the general condition of the real estate market, zoning and
the overall construction suitability of a site do influence the price.
Construction Estimates: The second major expense of any new school construction project is
the cost of actually developing the site and constructing the buildings(s). Such costs include
payment for planning, designing, engineering, constructing, furnishing, and equipping new
school facilities. In addition, at times, new portable classrooms are purchased and sited at new
schools and/or existing portable classrooms are moved to new school sites.

FUNDING SOURCES

School districts utilize budgets consisting of a number of discrete funds. However, for the most
part, the capital needs of any school system are addressed with the Capital Projects Fund and
the Debt Service Fund.
1. The Capital Projects fund is used for purposes such as: (a) to finance the purchase and
development of school sites; (b) the construction of new facilities and the
modernization of existing facilities; and (c) the purchase of initial equipment, library
books and textbooks for new facilities. Revenues accruing to the Capital Project Fund
come primarily from bond sale proceeds, capital levy collections, and state matching
funds. However, Revenues from the General Fund, the sale of property and
contributions can also be accrued to the Capital Projects Fund. School impact fees and
mitigation fees are maintained in segregated accounts.
2. The Debt Service Fund is used as a mechanism to pay for bonds. When a bond issue
passes, a school district sells bonds that have a face value and an interest rate. Local
property taxes are adjusted to provide the funds necessary to meet the approved
periodic payments on sold bonds. The proceeds from the taxes collected for this
purpose are deposited in the Debt Service Fund and drawn out for payments at the
appropriate times.
As noted earlier, school districts receive funds for capital program purposes from a variety of
sources. Those sources are described as follows:
Bonds: Bonds are financial instruments having a face value and an interest rate, which is
determined at the time and by the conditions of their sale. Bonds are backed by the “full faith
and credit” of the issuing school district and may be paid from proceeds derived from a specific
increase in the property taxes for that purpose. The increase in the taxes results in an “excess
levy” of taxes beyond the constitutional limit, so the bonds must be approved by a vote of the
people in the jurisdiction may not exceed five (5) percent of the assessed value of the property
within that jurisdiction at the time of issuance. Bonds are multi-year financial instruments,
generally issued for 10-20 years. Because of their long-lasting impact, they require both an
extraordinary plurality of votes and a specific minimum number of voters for validation. The
positive votes must equal or exceed 60 percent of the total number of voters in the school
district who cast ballots in the last general election.
Proceeds from bond sales are limited by bond covenants and must be used for the purpose(s)
for which the bonds are issued. They cannot be converted to a non-capital or operating
purpose. The life of the improvement resulting from the bonds must meet or exceed the term
of the bonds themselves.
Capital Levies: Capital Levies differ from bonds in that they do not result in the issuance of a
financial instrument and, therefore, do not affect the “bonded indebtedness” of a school
district. This method of financing is a straight increase in property tax rates to produce a voterapproved dollar amount. The amount generated from the capital levy is then available to a
SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 27 of 35
Packet page 139 of 173

district in the approved year. The actual levy rate itself is determined by dividing the number of
dollars approved by the assessed valuation of the total district at the time the taxes are set by
the County Council. While a typical period for capital levies is one or two years, they can be
approved for up to a six-year period at one election. The amounts to be collected are identified
for each year separately and the tax rates set for each individual year. Like bond issues, capital
levies must be used for the specific capital purpose(s) that they were passed. They cannot be
converted to a non-capital or operating purpose.
State Funding Assistance: The State of Washington has a Common School Construction Fund.
The State Board of Education is responsible for administration of the funds and the
establishment of matching ratios. The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI),
has determined that Steilacoom School District’s 2024 funding assistance ratio is 52.15% for
those expenses that are defined as eligible for state funding assistance. However, the District’s
planned elementary school capacity project in this six-year plan are not anticipated to qualify
for state funding.
The base to which the percent is applied is the cost of construction, as determined by the
Construction Cost Allocation. The Construction Cost Allocation is an index of construction costs
that is used by the state to hold, define, or limit their level of support. This particular
construction cost index rarely matches the actual cost of school construction in districts across
Washington State. Nevertheless, the Construction Cost Allocation for school construction costs
for July 2024 is $375.00 per square foot.
The formula for determining the amount of state matching support can be expressed as
AxBxC=D, where
A=
eligible area (determined by OSPI’s student square footage allowances)
B=
The Construction Cost Allocation (in dollars per square foot)
C=
A school district’s applicable state funding assistance rate
D=
the amount of state fiscal assistance to which a district will be entitled. Qualification for
state matching funds involves an application process. Districts may submit information for
consideration by the State Board of Education, which meets once every two months during the
year. Once approved, the district qualifies for matching funds in a sequence, which recognizes
the existing approvals of previous submittals. Failure of a school district to proceed with a
project in a timely manner can result in loss of a district’s “place in line”.
New construction projects are eligible for a state reimbursement at 100% of the Construction
Cost Allocation for matchable construction costs. In addition, state statute provides that
modernization of new-in-lieu-of replacement projects are eligible for state reimbursement at
100% of the Construction Cost Allocation.
Funds for the state match come from the Common School Construction Fund using revenues
accruing predominately from the sale of renewable resources, primarily timber, from state
school lands being set aside by the Enabling Act of 1889. If these sources are insufficient to
meet current needs, the legislature can appropriate additional funds or the Superintendent of
Public Instruction can prioritize projects for funding.
SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 28 of 35
Packet page 140 of 173

As noted in WAC 392-343-057, in the event that state matching monies are not available to
fund a specific school project, then school districts may proceed at their own financial risk. At
such time state monies do become available, reimbursement will be made to the district for the
state’s share of said project.
The District is currently not eligible for state reimbursement for new construction.
Impact Fees: According to RCW 82.02.050, the definition of an impact fee is “… a payment of
money imposed upon development as a condition of development approval to pay for public
facilities needed to serve new growth and development, and that is reasonably related to the
new development that creates additional demand and need for public facilities, that is a
proportionate share of the cost of the public facilities, and that is used for facilities that
reasonably benefit the new development. “Impact fee” does not include a reasonable permit or
application fee.”
Impact Fees can be collected where a District demonstrates an “un-housed student need” as
determined by applying the district’s level of service to projected growth from new residential
development. The amounts to be charged are calculated based on the costs for providing the
space for the projected number of students in each residential unit.
The District determines the cost per unit by using a student generation rate. The Pierce County
School Impact Fee Ordinance, Table 4A-1 of Chapter 4A.30 of the Pierce County Code, identifies
the school impact fee formula and defines the “Student Factor” as follows:
"Student Factor" is the number derived by a School District to describe how many students of
each grade span are expected to be generated by development activity. Student factors shall be
based on District records of average actual student generated rates for new developments
constructed over a period of not more than five years prior to the date of the fee calculation;
provided that, if such information is not available in the District or if there are no developments
in the District similar to that being proposed, the District may use data from districts with
similar demographics, or, if no other data sources are reasonably available, county-wide
averages.
For purposes of this year’s CFP, the District is relying on a 2024 student generation rate study
prepared by an independent consultant. The District has, in previous updates to its Capital
Facilities Plan, used student factors from nearby school districts where the sample size of
development within the District has not been adequate to produce a reliable District-specific
student factor. The District will revisit student generation rates in future updates to the Capital
Facilities Plan.

For impact fees, the District’s Board of Directors must first adopt a Capital Facilities Plan with
recommended fees and then, the towns, cities, and counties located within the District
boundaries must then adopt a school impact fee ordinance and adopt or update the District’s
recommended fee. Within the Steilacoom Historical School District, those general government
jurisdictions include the Town of Steilacoom, the City of DuPont and Pierce County.
Furthermore, developers may contribute properties which will have value to a district. In such
cases, the developer is entitled to a credit for the actual cost of the provided property. This
credit can reduce or eliminate the mitigation or impact fee that would be chargeable under the
mitigation/impact fee calculation.
The District collects school impact fees from new residential development in unincorporated
Pierce County, the Town of Steilacoom, and the City of DuPont. The District is not requesting
school impact fees from residential units with fewer than 2 bedrooms, and accessory dwelling
units (ADU) until such time that data becomes available to reasonably calculate the specific
impact from those units. The District also does not intend that school impact fees be collected
from residential units in communities that are restricted to ages 55 and over as these units
typically do not generate students to the school system.

Packet page 142 of 173

The Pierce County school impact fee ordinance requires that the calculated fee be discounted
by 50% and, in addition, artificially caps fees and updates the capped fee each year based upon
an escalation factor.
District impact fees are calculated for Single Family Units, Townhouses, and a composite rate
for Multi-Family Residential Units using the data provided on Enclosure 1 of this plan. The
Board of Directors has determined that the impact fee assessed for each townhouse unit will
receive a discretionary adjustment to limit the fee to be no greater than the calculated fee for
Single Family Units. This adjustment is being made until such time as the number of units
increases or the data becomes less volatile. The board retains the right to eliminate this
discretionary adjustment in future plan updates.
The Town of Steilacoom and City of DuPont generally use the District’s recommended fee as a
basis for the fee amount.
As noted above, the District utilized an independent consultant to research the student
generation rate specific to the District in 2024. The District will make decisions regarding any
future adjustment to the impact fee as the CFP is updated annually.
Enclosures 1 through 2 to this tab include the District’s 2024 impact fee calculations and data
for use in 2025.

THE DISTRICT FUNDING PLAN

The District’s Funding Plan is designed to identify the specific funding resources, the amounts of
funding needed and the unique relationships that exist between funding sources for each of the
capital projects set forth in the District’s Construction Plan. The District does not expect to
receive state matching funds for construction of the new elementary school. The District
anticipates that the new elementary school will cost approximately $48,000,000 (hard
construction costs only). The District’s voters will need to approve a bond measure to fund
construction of the new school. Impact fee revenue will also be used to fund the planning and
construction of any new school or additions to existing schools identified as growth related
projects. Impact fees may also be used to fund portable facilities needed for interim growthrelated capacity.
The District’s excess assessed value used to calculate the bond rate is $5,378,155,188 for the
2024 levy year.
Other minor sources of funding include grants, bequests, and proceeds from the sales of excess
property. They are usually a small part of the total financing package.

ELECTRONIC RESOURCES AND INTERNET SAFETY
The Steilacoom Historical School District No.1 Board of Directors recognizes that an effective
public education system develops students who are globally aware, civically engaged, and
capable of managing their lives and careers. The board also believes that staff and students need
to be proficient and safe users of information, media, and technology, including the appropriate
use of artificial intelligence to succeed in a digital world.
Electronic Resources
The district will develop and use electronic resources as a powerful and compelling means for
students to learn core subjects and applied skills in relevant and rigorous ways and for staff to
educate them in such areas of need. It is the district’s goal to provide students with rich and
ample opportunities to use technology for important purposes in schools just as individuals in
workplaces and other real-life settings use these tools. The district’s technology will enable
educators and students to communicate, learn, share, collaborate and create; to think and solve
problems; to manage their work; and to take ownership of their lives.
The superintendent or designee will: 1) create strong electronic resources and develop related
educational systems that support innovative teaching and learning; 2) provide appropriate staff
development opportunities regarding this policy; and 3) develop procedures to support this
policy.
The superintendent or designee is authorized to develop procedures and acceptable use
guidelines for staff and students as to use of district electronic resources, including those that
access Internet and social media, and to regulate use of personal electronic resources on district
property and related to district activities.

Internet Safety
To help ensure student safety and citizenship with electronic resources, all students will be
educated about Internet safety. This will include appropriate online behavior, including
interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms, and
cyberbullying awareness and response.
To promote Internet safety and appropriate online behavior of students and staff as they use
electronic resources and access material from the Internet, the superintendent or designee is
authorized to develop or adopt Internet safety procedures, acceptable use guidelines, and, for
students, related instructional materials for every grade level. The superintendent or designee in
evaluating such procedures and instructional materials should take into account District
electronic resources, community norms, privacy rights, responsible use, and issues of concern
with student or staff use of electronic resources.

Page 1 of 2

Packet page 149 of 173

Policy No. 2022
Instruction
As a component of district Internet safety measures, all district-owned electronic resources,
including computer networks and Wi-Fi, in all district facilities capable of accessing the Internet
must use filtering software to prevent access to obscene, racist, hateful or violent material.
However, given the ever-changing nature of the Internet, the district cannot guarantee that a
student will never be able to access objectionable material.
Further, when students use the Internet from school facilities for educational purposes, district
staff will make a reasonable effort to supervise student access and use of the internet. If material
is accessed that violates district policies, procedures or student guidelines for electronic
resources or acceptable use, district staff may instruct the person to cease using that material
and/or implement sanctions consistent with district policies, procedures, guidelines, or student
codes of conduct.

DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP AND MEDIA LITERACY
PURPOSE
In recognition of the fact that students use technology to play, learn, and communicate while at
home and at school, it is important that they learn how to use that technology responsibly. The
District is committed to educating every student on how to use technology in ways that augment
their learning experience, leading to analysis, evaluation, reflection, and enhanced skills of
expression. As the District’s educators guide exploration of the digital landscape, they will
encourage students to be critical and creative thinkers. Students, in turn, are expected to actively
engage with and express their voices in the digital landscape.
DEFINITIONS
The District is dedicated to promoting and instilling principles of digital citizenship and media
literacy in each of its students.
Digital Citizenship
Digital citizenship includes the norms of appropriate, responsible, and healthy behavior related to
current technology use, including artificial intelligence, digital and media literacy, ethics,
etiquette, and security. Digital citizenship includes the ability to access, analyze, evaluate,
develop, produce, and interpret media, as well as Internet safety and cyberbullying prevention
and response.
Digital citizens recognize and value the rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of living,
learning, and working in an interconnected digital world, and they engage in safe, legal, and
ethical behaviors. Digital citizens cultivate and manage their digital identity and reputation, and
are aware of the permanence of their actions in the digital world. They advocate for themselves
and others in their behavior, action, and choices.
Media Literacy
Media literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create, and act using a variety of forms
of communication, including communications developed with artificial intelligence. Media
literacy includes the ability to understand how and why media messages and images are
constructed and for what purposes they are used.
Media literate citizens examine how individuals interpret messages differently based on their
skills, beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences. They also consider how values and points of view
are included or excluded in various media. Media literate citizens remain continually aware of
the ways in which media can influence beliefs and behavior. In addition, media literate citizens
are effective communicators, able to demonstrate critical and creative thinking as they utilize
appropriate media creation tools. Further, they understand the conventions and characteristics of
the tools they have selected.

Page 1 of 3

Packet page 152 of 173

Policy No. 2023
Instruction
Media literate citizens are able to adapt to changing technologies and develop the new skills
required as they continue to engage in life-long learning. Media literacy empowers individuals to
participate as informed and active citizens in a democracy.
ELEMENTS OF SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION
The District aspires to implement the following practices to promote digital citizenship and
media literacy for all students.
Student instruction
All students will be educated regarding appropriate digital citizenship, including appropriate use
of artificial intelligence, interacting with other individuals online. Students will receive digital
citizenship instruction during the school year.
In recognition of the fact that students are consumers and creators of information and ideas, the
District promotes cross-curricular integration of digital citizenship and media literacy and
leadership instruction at all levels. The District recognizes the importance of students as active
participants, role models, and peer mentors in addressing the following topics:
Online safety, responsibility, and security
Students will learn how to be safe and responsible digital citizens, and they will be encouraged to
teach others about issues such as cyberbullying, social networking, online predators, and risky
communications. Lessons on online safety issues, including cyberbullying awareness/response
will be provided according to 2022/2022P – Electronic Resources and Internet Safety.
Media literacy
Students will learn how to produce their own media; how to examine the ways in which people
experience or interact with media differently; how to identify embedded values and stereotypes;
how to analyze words and images critically; and how to evaluate the various sources of
information with which they are presented.
Law, fair use, copyright, and intellectual property
Students will learn about the importance of navigating the digital landscape in ways that are
legal, including access to and use of copyrighted materials. Students will also learn how to
access and create intellectual property legally.
Online identify and personal brand
Students will learn about their “digital footprint” and the persistence of their digital information,
including on social media. Students will also learn about the creation and maintenance of their
self-image, reputation, and online identity.
Ethics, digital communications, and collaboration
Students will learn about fairness and civil discourse in the digital environment, including the
appropriate uses of artificial intelligence and the importance of collaborating and ethically
interacting with others online.

Packet page 153 of 173

Policy No. 2023
Instruction
Professional Development
The District endeavors to support teachers and instructional leaders in developing leadership
skills and proficiency in the principles of digital citizenship and media literacy, both as an
instructional imperative and as dynamic District policy and practice.
Policy and Practices
The District acknowledges the need for digital and online policies that are dynamic and
responsive to diverse community standards and student learning outcomes. The District annually
reviews its policies and procedures on electronic resources, Internet safety, digital citizenship,
and media literacy. The District authorizes the Superintendent to develop further procedures and
guidelines if appropriate.
Communications and Engagement
The District acknowledges that parents and community stakeholders are partners in developing
students as digital citizens and life-long learners. The District encourages parents’ active
engagement in the process of educating students to become media-literate digital citizens.

scope significantly over the past several years based on new laws and new state and federal
guidance.
Recently, WSSDA provided new model policies that divides policy 6700 into several separate

NUTRITION, HEALTH, AND PHYSICAL FITNESS
The board recognizes that a healthy school environment prepares students for college, careers,
and successful futures. Students who eat well-balanced meals and engage in regular exercise are
more likely to learn in the classroom. The board supports the district’s increased emphasis on
nutrition, health, physical education, and physical activity at all grade levels to enhance the wellbeing of the district’s students. Therefore, it is the policy of the board to provide students with
access to nutritious food as stated in this policy, emphasize health education and physical
education, and provide students with opportunities for physical activity. The board recognizes
the benefits of scheduling at least 20 minutes of seat time for lunch for every student and
scheduling recess before lunch for elementary students. Consequently, to the extent appropriate
and feasible, the superintendent or designee will strive to identify and remove barriers to these
practices and periodically report back to the board.
Wellness Policy
The district, through a wellness committee, will develop and implement a comprehensive
wellness policy in compliance with state and federal requirements for districts participating in
the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program, and the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Smart Snacks in School nutrition standards.
Nutrition and Food Services Program
The board supports the philosophy of the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs
and will provide wholesome and nutritious meals for children in the district’s schools. The board
authorizes the superintendent or designee to administer the food services program, provided that
any decision to enter into a contract with a food service management company will require the
approval of the board. Expenditures for food supplies shall not exceed the estimated revenues.
The Superintendent or designee is responsible for:
 Annually distributing meal applications and determining eligibility for school meals;
 Protecting the identity of students eligible for free and reduced-price meals;
 Ensuring meals meet USDA meal pattern requirements;
 Ensuring meal periods are in compliance with USDA regulations;
 Establishing a Food Safety Plan;
 Determining meal prices and submitting them to the board for approval annually;
 Using the full entitlement of USDA Foods;
 Maintaining a nonprofit school food service account;
 Ensuring all revenues are used solely for the school meal program;
 Establishing a meal charge policy if not serving meals at no cost to students;
 Accommodating children with special dietary needs;

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Policy 6700 has historically included the district policies associated with Student Nutrition and Food
Service, Recess, Physical Education, and Staff and Student Wellness. This policy has increased in
scope significantly over the past several years based on new laws and new state and federal
guidance.
Recently, WSSDA provided new model policies that divides policy 6700 into several separate
policies, each covering distinct areas. Staff reviewed the new WSSDA model policy structure and
agrees that it makes sense to divide up the policies into new policies:
• 2124 Physical Education and Health Class
• 6701 Recess and Physical Activity
• 6702 Wellness
Policy 6700 will be retained with only the Nutrition portion of the existing policy.
While there were minor changes in the policy language, there are no changes that are substantive
or impact existing practice.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

I move adoption of policies 6700, 6701, 6702, and 2124 as presented.

Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent

RECESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
The board recognizes that recess is an essential part of the day for elementary school students.
Young students learn through play, and recess supports the mental, physical, and emotional
health of students and positively impacts their learning and behavior. Similarly, the board
recognizes that students who engage in regular exercise are more likely to learn in the classroom
and supports the district’s increased emphasis on physical activity at all grade levels to enhance
the well-being of the district’s students. Therefore, it is the policy of the board to provide
students with recess and opportunities for physical activity.
Recess
The district aims to make elementary school recess safe, inclusive, and high quality for all
students.
All district elementary schools will receive a minimum of 30 minutes per day of unstructured
physical activity as recess. The accompanying procedure will specify how the district will meet
other legal requirements.
Physical Activity
All schools, as a best practice and subject to available funding, will participate in a multicomponent approach by which schools use all opportunities for students to be physically active,
such as the Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program recommended by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

WELLNESS
The board recognizes that a healthy school environment prepares students for college, careers,
and successful futures. Students who engage in regular exercise are more likely to learn in the
classroom. The board supports the district’s increased emphasis on health, physical education,
and physical activity at all grade levels to enhance the well-being of the district’s students.
Therefore, it is the policy of the board to emphasize health education and physical education and
provide students with opportunities for physical activity.
Wellness Policy
The district, through a wellness committee, will develop and implement a comprehensive
wellness policy in compliance with state and federal requirements for districts participating in
the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program, and the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Smart Snacks in School nutrition standards.
The District, as a best practice and subject to available funding, will participate in a multicomponent approach by which schools use all opportunities for students to be physically active,
such as the Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program recommended by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
