This transcript details feedback from a parent advisory committee meeting regarding various school district policies and practices.  Parents expressed concerns about the inconsistency of science curriculum across schools, advocating for a more standardized approach. They also voiced opinions on the kindergarten schedule, preferring a return to daily half-day sessions with a noon release time. The late start time was another point of contention, leading to supervision issues after school and prompting the PTA to offer before-school activities.  The parent highlighted the positive impact of specialized teachers for PE and music but lamented the cuts to the PE program and the loss of the strings program. Concerns were also raised about the adequacy of special education support for struggling students. The district acknowledged these concerns, particularly regarding the balance between allowing school autonomy and ensuring consistent academic standards across all schools.  The superintendent noted that limited resources necessitate difficult choices, prompting a discussion on prioritizing full-day kindergarten versus other programs.
