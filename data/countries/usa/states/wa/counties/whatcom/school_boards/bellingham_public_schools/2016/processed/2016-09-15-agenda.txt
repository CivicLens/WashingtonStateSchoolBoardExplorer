Action

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the request outlined below in connection
with a settlement agreement between the district and the
former owner of a district-owned parcel of land. As
Superintendent, I have reviewed and approved this request
and fully support board approval of the settlement
agreement.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
In 1999 the district purchased a parcel located south of Iowa Street and north of Ohio Street near Bellingham High School and our
former warehouse. Since that time the parcel has been used for a pedestrian/bicycle trail and a storm water facility.
As part of the new Options High School, the parcel will be developed into a parking lot and a stormwater facility. The pedestrian/bicycle
trail will be relocated as per a plan approved by the City of Bellingham.
Some contaminated soils were recently discovered on the parcel. The proposed settlement agreement between the district and the
former owner of the property allows the Options High School project to proceed without further delay and provides compensation to the
district to assist with costs associated with remediating the parcel.
Our legal counsel has assisted the district over the past several weeks in negotiating the proposed settlement agreement.
Board approval of the settlement agreement is requested.
