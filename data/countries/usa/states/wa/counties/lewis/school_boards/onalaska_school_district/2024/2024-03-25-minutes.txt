The food service audit went well. The auditor praised the director and the staff for their performance, indicating a positive out come.
There's progress on our grant related to HVAC in collaboration with Mckinstry. Although there's a limitation due to a significant increase in inflation, which impacts the ability to upgrade both hearing and cooling systems, the upgrades will focus on heating systems initially. However, the upgrades will be designed to accommodate future integration of air conditioning systems when feasible.
These updates highlight efforts toward improving infrastructure and operational efficiency within the school district despite challenges such as inflation.
      Larry Markuson, Elementary Principal provided updates on iReady scores. Student's performance showing promising results, with Math scores at 89% passing and ELA at 80% passing. These high passing rates indicate that students are likely to perform well on the upcoming SBAC testing, reflecting positively on their academic readiness.
The elementary school has been actively engaged in trauma-informed training. They have already visited 8 classrooms as part of this initiative. The feedback suggests that the training has been highly beneficial for both students and staff members, indicating a positive impact on the school environment and student well-being.
These updates underscore the school's commitment to both academic excellence and the holistic well-being of students, through effective instructional practices and initiatives focused on supporting students' social-emotional needs.
  K-5 Music/Visual Arts Teacher Laura Houser shared information with the Board regarding an upcoming art contest for students K-12. The WA529 3rd Annual Art Contest theme revolves around students drawing their dream job. The winner of the contest receives a $529 deposit into a college savings account.
