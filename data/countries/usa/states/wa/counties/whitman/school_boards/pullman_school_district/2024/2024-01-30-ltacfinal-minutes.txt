B. Agenda
Action, Motions: 1. American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) Grant Application
Chairperson Pat Wright reminded the commission of previous conversations regarding the AJGA grant
application. She recapped Marie Dymkoski reaching out to Libby Burroughs with the AJGA. Marie had a
very positive conversation with Libby and how the AJGA can partner with Pullman Chamber of Commerce
to really promote Pullman. The AJGA with the grant request of $40,000 can give “Visit Pullman/Pullman
Chamber of Commerce” title sponsorship, purchase gift cards for local businesses/services, and help
encourage tournament participants to stay for Pullman’s 4th of July and tour the local area. AJGA is also
happy to put the logo on the tournament shirt. Also, if there are funds remaining from the tournament,
these funds are donated within the local community. Pat Wright also was able to connect with Marie
Dymkoski virtually and Marie spoke on her conversation with Libby with AJGA. She addressed a question
from Tim Cordodor regarding where the tournament fees from participants is spent during the tournament
as the Commission could not see where that is accounted for on the P&L that was provided to the
commission. She had not asked that question of Libby Burroughs and did not currently have an answer to
that—but it is something we can follow up on for future requests. It was discussed that if AJGA did not
receive the full $40,000 that they may not continue to come to Pullman.
Meghan Wiley asked if in the future could the AJGA spread out room block bookings to more hotels in the
Pullman community as Lodging Tax dollars are gathered from all hotels to help fund LTAC grant requests.
The commission then spoke about ideas to help ensure those requesting grants have a complete listing of
community hotels to choose from and the commission be mindful to support all community hotels with
events that are granted LTAC funds.
The Commission then discussed whether the additional increase in $10,000 is worth the title sponsorship
for AJGA. The Commission discussed that $40,000 is a common amount to get title sponsorship. That the
AJGA is good for the community, restaurants, WSU and WSU coaches. That this event has a positive long-

term impact on Pullman. The Commission also discussed the benefits of having a National tournament
come to Pullman. AJGA provides National level exposure for both the City of Pullman and the golf course.
The AJGA is providing what is asked for with grant requests by bringing in participants from a wide variety
of locations, increasing business locally and providing Pullman with national exposure. Therefore, the
commission put forth a motion for the AJGA grant request.
A motion to award American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) the full amount of the grant request of
$40,000.00 with the AJGA giving the Title Sponsorship to Visit Pullman/Pullman Chamber of Commerce
with the requirement that $10,000 be used to purchase gift cards for local services.
