The City Council of Pullman held a regular meeting on February 27, 2024, where several significant policy changes were discussed, particularly regarding the enforcement of regulations related to electric scooters and bicycles. Community Development Director RJ Lott proposed extending the moratorium on enforcing Pullman City Code sections related to these vehicles until December 31, 2024, to facilitate greater mobility during the construction of Project Downtown. This moratorium extension was approved through Resolution No. R-13-24. Additionally, the Council authorized a contract with Spin to provide up to 100 electric scooters and 50 electric bicycles throughout the city, which will include a $12,000 annual fee and a 20-cent per ride fee. The contract will also allow for geofencing to restrict scooter and bicycle access in certain areas during construction.

The meeting also featured a presentation by Welch Comer Representatives regarding the communication plan for the Downtown Pullman Project, emphasizing community engagement through upcoming open houses. The Council discussed the importance of maintaining access to businesses during construction and proposed the creation of an ad hoc parking committee to address potential parking issues arising from the project. The committee would include the Mayor, Police Chief, Fire Marshal, and City Engineer to ensure effective transportation and traffic management throughout the construction period.
