the same team. The ten players are coached by Marielle Face and Cabe VanderYacht. Grant Brickbealer serves as an assistant.

thanks to our tech coaches at each of these schools for their extra work with implementing and supporting the administration of the
NAEP.
- Isom Elementary has shifted their 5th grade lunch to coordinate with Kinder and TK lunches. Isom 5th graders participate as role
models as they support, encourage, and teach our younger learners in the cafeteria as well as out on the playground. They are also
building leadership skills for the future!
- Fisher Elementary began their Extended Day program last week. This is an opportunity for students who may need a bit of extra help
to receive support before school through learning activities prepared by staff.
- Special thanks to our grounds and maintenance staff as they navigate the impacts of winter weather. They have been working
tirelessly responding to the needs of each building.
