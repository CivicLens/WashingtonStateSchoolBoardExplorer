Dan Persse addressed the board on behalf of the Blaine Education Association. He described concern regarding the district's intent to add administrative positions while implementing a reduction in force. Historical background and funding sources were referenced.

  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Reports
School administrators reviewed their written reports. Each shared positive comments about having all hybrid students in person every week. At the last count, there were 44 new Kindergartners registered for next year. Director McKinney asked how BPS students are responding to Conscious Discipline concepts their young age, and Mr. Radke described the use of Feeling Buddies for this purpose. Dawn Cottnair described her recent collaboration with Terre Shapiro for testing in the K-5 REACH program. President Gibson praised this year's BMS lipdub production. Director McKinney asked about the WCC virtual tour and discussion followed regarding efforts to build college interest with middle school students. During each presentation, Director Thomas asked how many hybrid students are now attending in person every week, and each administrator provided an estimate.
  B. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment through the month of April which was very similar to March. Director Lotze asked if the report includes online student enrollment. Ms. Porter explained that it does, and this report does not differentiate between online and hybrid students. Director Thomas asked about the general education cost per student, and Ms. Porter commented on that information. Discussion continued regarding apportionment deficits due to lower enrollment, and Ms. Porter explained various factors that impact how much the district has received this year for apportionment revenue. She indicated that the state is expected to provide relief for the impact next year related to enrollment loss. Director Thomas asked if ESSER funds have limited use. Ms. Porter provided an overview of how ESSER funding can be spent, as well as the requirement to record staff time and effort. Large purchases will also need to follow existing procurement protocols.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of March. State apportionment revenue included the district's first award of ESSER funds. An adjustment in the Transportation Fund reflects low ridership. Preparations are underway for the upcoming roofing project funded by Capital Projects. Cash and Investment balances are trending higher than past years due to current conservative spending practices. Discussion continued regarding expectations for next year's apportionment revenue, and Ms. Porter indicated she has no concerns about being able to fund the district's programming. Ms. Porter explained that next year's use of ESSER funds will need to be included on the budget. Director Thomas asked about funding sources for large purchases and discussion followed. Director Nunamaker asked if there will be a financial impact related to hybrid students now attending every week, and why is there a spike in revenue every April? Ms. Porter provided explanations, and there was discussion regarding tax revenue received by local school districts from the large industries in our local area.
  D. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Legislative Work: OSPI has released the template for the reopening plan due on June 1st. Dr. Granger is working with Executive Director Stacy Thomas and the leadership team on finalizing that plan. Examples of expenses funded by ESSER include additional furniture purchases, added custodial services, PPE, etc. Although students will be able to attend in person full time, there will still be pandemic-related safety protocols in place. Starting on May 1st, families will be able to indicate via a survey if they prefer online attendance for their students. This will inform the extent of the district's needs to accommodate these students. With the expiration of current instructional waivers, online learning will look very different next year.
Staffing: Decisions related to staffing adjustments have been grounded in what is best for kids and focused on improving student outcomes. ESSER funding will provide an opportunity to address one-time needs in the district. Dr. Granger explained that he does not conduct teacher evaluations himself, and he described the professional support that school administrators are expected to provide for teachers and staff members. Additional administrative positions will provide the added support teachers have been asking for, particularly in the areas of student discipline and social emotional learning which are expected to be high priorities in the 2021-2022 school year. The K-5 and 6-12 Dean positions, funded by ESSER, are intended to provide this support to teachers, enabling them to focus on their work in the classroom, as well as to support families in an effort to ensure that students transition successfully back to full time attendance in school.
Budget Planning: There continue to be many unknown impacts from the legislature as well as bargaining. ESSER funded expenses must be paid by the district and then reimbursed.
2021-2022: Guidance from the Health Department is anticipated in the coming months on new guidelines. The district continues to plan for all students to attend full time in person, unless they have chosen the online learning model.
Focus Groups: The district's Equity group met during the week of March 8. A Student Support Services Q&A session was conducted on April 19 and this will take place quarterly moving forward with the goal of improving inclusionary practices for Special Education students. Next year's Superintendent Advisory Committee has been introduced to Blaine High School students, and student participants will be recruited in the fall.
Facility Use: Community youth sports groups have been able to use the district's outdoor facilities at scheduled times, in compliance with COVID restrictions and record-keeping requirements.
Wrestling: The State Department of Health has issued a requirement for wrestlers to be tested twice each week in order to participate in the school program. Parent permission is required, and the district will be seeking DOH authorization to test on site.
Upcoming Events: Graduation guidance from the state is still pending, and Dr. Granger will host a Senior Parent Meeting on May 4 regarding the district's plan for a ceremony on June 11. A Community Q&A session is scheduled on May 3 and Director McKinney will attend to observe.
Director Nunamaker asked for clarification regarding Special Education enrollment and discussion followed. Dr. Granger explained that adjustments to the Sped program will actually lower teacher caseloads. Director Thomas asked who would administer COVID testing for the wrestling team and Dr. Granger explained that this would be handled by the district's Athletic Trainer, Sydney Johnson. Director McKinney asked about bus driver availability for special assignments outside of regular routes and discussion followed. There was additional discussion regarding the make-up of the district's Instructional Leadership Team, as well as the district's communication protocols and requirements for records retention on social media accounts.
