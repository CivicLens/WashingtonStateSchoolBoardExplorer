Recognition

Background Information:
We honor the first people of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of the Suquamish
Tribe of Indians.
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its Indigenous
People, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or under-served.
This Land Acknowledgement is a formal statement that Bremerton School District recognizes and respects Native Peoples as traditional
guardians of the land and the enduring relationship that exists between Native peoples and their traditional territories.
We would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is within the ancestral territory of the suqabs People of
Clear Salt Water (Suquamish People). Expert fisherman, canoe builders and basket weavers, the suqabs live in harmony with the
lands and waterways along Washingtons Central Salish Sea as they have for thousands of years. Here, the suqabs live and protect
the land and waters of their ancestors for future generations as promised by the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855.
We also acknowledge the enduring presence and deep traditional knowledge of the indigenous people with whom we share this land today.

Information

Public Content
The Board welcomes public input at its meetings.Although meetings are in-person, citizens/staff may stillsend an email to bsdboard@bremertonschools.org, using "Public Input" in the Subject area. These should be received before 1pm on the day of the Board
meeting in order to be included on the agenda for that date. At a regular meeting, sign-in sheets are available if you wish to address the
Board.
Our Board has adopted policy/procedure 1400/1400P Meeting Conduct, Order of Business, and Quorum. This policy and procedure are
available on the school district website. By adopting this policy, board meetings must be conducted in a civil, orderly, and business - like
manner. This means that whether we are school directors, district staff, students, members of the community, or some other guest, we all
must follow the same standard of civility during school board meetings.
The Board recognizes the value of public comment on educational issues and the importance of involving members of the public in its
meetings. This public comment period is an opportunity for visitors to be recognized and make brief comments.
General reminders:
The total time for public comment period is not to exceed 60 minutes. Each speaker has a maximum of 3 minutes.
There is no mechanism whereby a speaker can donate some or all of their time to another speaker.
No individual may speak more than once on a singular topic per regular meeting, even if there is time remaining.
Public comment period is an opportunity for the board to listen to individuals on educational issues and board members are
encouraged to listen attentively.
However, public comment period is not a time for dialogue between the Board and the public. The Board will not respond to
statements, questions, or challenges made during public comment period and there will be no back-and-forth dialogue.
Please know that the boards silence is neutral. It is neither a signal of agreement or disagreement with the speakers remarks.
Although the Board will not engage in dialogue, the Board Chair might ask a speaker a clarifying question. It is also possible that school
district staff will contact a speaker at a later time to follow up on an issue raised during a public comment period.
Finally, please remember that your words have impact and you, not the school district, are responsible for your words. We caution all
speakers that it is possible that your statements could violate the rights of others under various laws, including laws protecting privacy and
laws prohibiting defamation. If you are unsure of the legal effect of your remarks, you should seek independent legal advice. In any case, we
ask that you help us model for our students what a respectful and inclusive community looks and sounds like.
