Call to Order:

Mr. Conroy, Board Chairman called the meeting to order at 7:00 p.m. He welcomed guests and
led the flag salute.

Calendar Discussion:

Mr. Conroy opened the floor to the public for discussion regarding the school calendar for 20142015 and 2015-2016. Many people spoke about their preference for a full two-week winter break
schedule as opposed to the draft calendars with a shortened winter break. Mrs. Schroder
suggested that parents be afforded the opportunity for input; Mrs. Klejeski noted that students
are unable to focus days before the Christmas holiday; Mr. Lean suggested that students may be
absent from school anyway due to family holiday plans; Mr. Eikanas noted that many people
travel for the holidays; Mrs. Wilkins noted that she does not support the two school days before
Christmas; Mrs. Stout noted that there was a small amount of feedback on the drafted calendar;
Mrs. Hedges noted that the holiday season is very important family time and going to winter
break on December 24th is not sufficient time for travel; Mrs. Thayer noted that a signed petition
was a suggestion for changes to the draft calendar; Mr. Henry noted that we must keep the high
school graduation date in mind when creating calendars; Ms. Cozean noted that two weeks at
winter break is best for getting rested; Mrs. Schmidt felt children do not learn that last few days
before the holiday; Mr. Bighorn suggested having one representative from each building and one
from the community develop the calendar; Mrs. Johnson noted that there are 180 days of school
worked by staff and all three school buildings prefer a two week winter break period; Mrs. Reed
noted that the calendar does not matter to her but she supports the staff.
Mr. Conroy noted that the total hours of the school day was being changed by the Legislature
and therefore, changes may need to be made to the calendar to accommodate this action. Since
the Legislature has delayed this total hour requirement change to the next legislative session, the
district may need to address this issue again in the future. The Superintendent was directed to
create a new draft calendar and discuss with staff then present for action at the next meeting.

Presentations:

Rob Wing, Advisor for the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) club shared information on
a community service project the club is conducting to renovate the high school tennis court.
Hanna Hoffman spoke about her involvement with tennis and thanked the Board for resurfacing
the court again this year noting that the court was originally built in 1977. FBLA will sell tiles to be
installed at the court entrance to help fund the tennis court renovation. Mrs. Hoffman added
that in conjunction with grants, donations and fund raising events, she hope the school district
will also consider funding for the court renovation.
Laurie Wilhite-GHS Business Teacher and Lisa Harness-WSU 4-H Extension Representative
provided information on a Tech Wizards Grant that has funded a recent field trip for high school
students to video and photograph the Western Automobile and Aeroplane Museum. The
purpose of the grant is to help retain students in school, to graduate from high school and to
seek a higher education, with a focus on technology. A second field trip is planned for May 8th to

kindergarten students at 1.0 fte, otherwise they would typically be counted at half time
