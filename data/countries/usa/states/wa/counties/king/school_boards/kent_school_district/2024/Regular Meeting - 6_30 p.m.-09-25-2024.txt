ABSENCE OF A BOARD MEMBER

Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice, as soon as possible, to the president or
superintendent of their inability to attend a board meeting. Board directors will participate in a roll call to
reflect attendance during the meeting for the record. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive absences from
regular board meetings without receiving respectful communication from the absent board member.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.
