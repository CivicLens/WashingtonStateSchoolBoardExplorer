4. Information from the Audience
Topics of discussion from the audience included: Is the Board aware of daily activities for students,
the Board is not supporting families; How are ESSR funds being spent, Director Vis should resign from
his position, Board isn’t willing to stand up to Governor Inslee’s demands, call Inslee’s bluff, families
will do a mass exodus from public school if vaccination is required for students; Correlation between

Parkinson’s disease and vaccination, data on vaccination deaths; Tired of watching kids in masks,
masking mandate is garbage, need to form a coalition with other districts; Masking is wrong it
doesn’t work, CRT is wrong; Board needs to step-up and take control, stand against the lies about
COVID, vaccine is gene therapy, too bad if funds are withdrawn from schools for not masking, kids
introduced to sexual immorality stop it it’s nonsense; Mask breaks, be on right side of history and
form a coalition, Board should uphold the constitution, all Board members need to resign if they do
not stand with us, let’s work together.
