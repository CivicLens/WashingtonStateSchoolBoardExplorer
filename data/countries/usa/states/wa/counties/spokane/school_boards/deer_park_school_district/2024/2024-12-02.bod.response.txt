DPSD Board of Directors The Deer Park School Board is comprised of five directors elected by Deer Park voters each to a four year term. Four of the five directors in Deer Park represent a director district, while one member is elected to an At Large seat ( the seat is not tied to a specific Director District). Click on the following link for district map showing Deer Park s director districts: DPSD DIRECTOR DISTRICTS What Does a School Board Do? The list of School Board duties is lengthy, including hiring the Superintendent, making decisions on property acquisition or sale, approving collectively bargained agreements, authorizing public bids and large expenditures, approving the district's annual budgets, adopting core curriculum, as well as specific issues related to personnel. The authority of individual board members is limited to participating in actions taken by the board as a whole when legally in session. Board members do not assume the responsibilities of school administrators or other employees. All business of the School Board is conducted in open public meetings except for matters involving property or personnel issues. Simply stated, it is not the job of the Board to manage schools, but rather to oversee that schools are managed well.
