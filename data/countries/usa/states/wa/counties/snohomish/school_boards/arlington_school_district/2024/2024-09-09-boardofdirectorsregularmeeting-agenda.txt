Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulg√°b).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time
immemorial and their ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice
the traditional ways of their ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural
traditions passed on to them by their ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these
lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its
Indigenous people, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history,
and can demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.
