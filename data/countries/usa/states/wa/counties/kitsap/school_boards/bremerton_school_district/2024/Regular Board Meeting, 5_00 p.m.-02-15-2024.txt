Background Information:
We honor the first people of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of the Suquamish
Tribe of Indians.
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its Indigenous
People, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or under-served.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history, and can
demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all. It is only one small part of
supporting Indigenous communities.
The following Land Acknowledgement has been approved by the Suquamish Tribe:
We would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is within the ancestral territory of the suqabs People of
Clear Salt Water (Suquamish People). Expert fisherman, canoe builders and basket weavers, the suqabs live in harmony with the
lands and waterways along Washingtons Central Salish Sea as they have for thousands of years. Here, the suqabs live and protect
the land and waters of their ancestors for future generations as promised by the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855.

H. Aspect Consulting Contract Change Order #10
(Project #100094)

Action (Consent)

Public Content
The District continues working with Aspect Consulting on the Remedy Implementation Project at the
Crownhill site. Each year, Aspect Consulting provides the District with a Contact Change outlining the
planned work for the coming year and associated costs. This Change Order covers the period from
February 1, 2024 through January 31, 2025, and the related cost for that period is $63,780.00.
Background: The first Crownhill Elementary School was built at the Rocky Point site in 1955/56. In the 1930's and 40's, this property was
used as a sand and gravel pit and as a landfill for various materials including municipal and industrial wastes. In 1994, site work for a new
Crownhill Elementary School was started on the property and soils were identified as known or suspected contaminated soils. The Dept. of
Ecology required the District to have a policy (current Policy 6519 adopted June 1995) to ensure that the soil material below one foot depth
would not be disturbed. In 2009, the district worked with the Dept. of Ecology and the Kitsap County Health District to take soil samples, and
contracted with DoE to provide technical consultations on the independent remedial actions proposed for or performed at the site. The
District continued to work closely with DoE to ensure all formalities were in place so that the District could switch from a Voluntary
Compliance Program (VCP) to the "Agreed Order" program. At that time, the DoE mandated an Agreed Order for site monitoring and cleanup due to changes in regulations around theModel Toxics Control Act,RCW 70.105D.050(1). It obligated the District to perform three main
tasks: 1) remedial investigation, 2) a feasibility study, and 3) to develop a clean-up action plan. At that time, the District also applied for a
grant with the Dept. of Ecology that could provide up to 90% of eligible costs. The Agreed Order was approved by the Board on August 19,
2010. The District continued to work with Aspect on a proposal for the first five years of Remedy Implementation. After receiving their
proposal, the District contracted with Aspect Consulting in December 2014 for Aspect Consulting to:1) Provide required quarterly progress
reports to Ecology; 2) Prepare a Cleanup Remedy Plan; and 3) Provide routine cleanup remedy monitoring and reporting to include
contingent actions.

This form, submitted by Cathie Seevers, Director of Finance, is a replacement for a similar form that was

instructional purposes. The District feels it is important to tie this form to the Policy (6540, School
District's Responsibility for Privately Owned Property) so staff are aware that there is a process that must
be followed before the District will assume liability for any personal property. This process includes the
staff member, school administration and the business office so that items can be recorded and tracked.
The form was also updated to clarify the guidelines of what will be accepted into the classrooms.
