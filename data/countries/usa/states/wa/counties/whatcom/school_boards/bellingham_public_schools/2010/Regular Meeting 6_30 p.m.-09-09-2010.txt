Program Plan:
The 2010-2011 school year will be a year of transition. District HCL Coordinator, Peggy Taylor, and Director of Federal
Programs, Susan Peterson, have both retired and the responsibility for the HCL Program has been transferred to the Curriculum
Department. A replacement for the HCL Coordinator will be hired and the services of Peggy Taylor to support the transition will
be obtained via a Personal Services Contract due to the uniqueness of the duties and responsibilities of the position. Peggy will
also support the current HCL model in order to meet the immediate needs of our current HCL student population and program
requirements and timelines.
Meanwhile, the Curriculum Department will initiate an audit or survey of the current HCL Program model in order to begin a
dialogue about potential changes and consideration of alternate models. The aim of this effort is to explore changes that would
move the programs target student population from the current top 2.314% gifted students, to the top 10-20% advanced learners.
During the 2009-2010 school year, a committee of concerned parents and district personnel met on a regular basis to explore
the need for an enriched curriculum for our top academic learners. It is the Curriculum Departments goal to work towards
meeting these needs along with those of the identified HCL student population. We feel there exists a great need for this and the
2010-2011 school year is a great year to initiate this exploration due to the current focus of creating effective Professional
Learning Communities (PLCs), and the implementation of Response to Intervention (RtI). The over-arching goal of both of these
efforts is to identify those students that are struggling learners and to provide timely interventions to address their learning
difficulties. Meanwhile, while the system is addressing those needs, how should the system respond to those students that are
succeeding and excelling? I believe that in order to create a school district whose efforts and resources are equitably balanced,
we must consider both directions from the mean.
Thank you for reviewing this overview and I look forward to your questions, input, and approval.
