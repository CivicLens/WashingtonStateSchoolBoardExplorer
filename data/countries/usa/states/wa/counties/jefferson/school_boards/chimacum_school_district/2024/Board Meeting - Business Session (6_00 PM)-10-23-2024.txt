Land Acknowledgement
We acknowledge the land we are gathering on is the traditional land of the Chemakum, and S'Klallam people. They have lived
and convened here, and taken care of the land, the water, the wildlife, and the soil since time immemorial. Many Indigenous
people still live in this place, thriving and proud.

We acknowledge that each of us has a story of our lineage and our culture. It is part of our shared humanity to be seen and
acknowledged for our stories. We are especially mindful of how the stories of the people of this place weave together and that
we lift each other up to see and be seen.
