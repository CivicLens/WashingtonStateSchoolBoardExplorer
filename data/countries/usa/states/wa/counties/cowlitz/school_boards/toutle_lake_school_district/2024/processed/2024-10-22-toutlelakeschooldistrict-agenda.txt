other information that, if made public, may increase risk to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
agency security or to information technology infrastructure or assets;
B. To consider the selection of a site or the acquisition of real estate by lease or purchase when public
knowledge regarding such consideration would cause a likelihood of increased price;
C. To consider the minimum price at which real estate will be offered for sale or lease when public
knowledge regarding such consideration would cause a likelihood of decreased price. However,
discussion of the factors comprising the minimum value of the property, and the final action of selling or
leasing public property will be taken in a meeting open to the public;
D. To review negotiations on the performance of publicly-bid contracts when public knowledge regarding
such consideration would cause a likelihood of increased costs;
