----- Written Comment(s) ----1.<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Angela Acres:Dear School Board, I urge you to
commission a forensic audit to address concerns regarding the district's financial management. The community's trust has been
eroded, and it appears that successive administrations have lost sight of the fact that they are managing taxpayer dollars. Given the
alarming expenditure levels in the 21-22 and 22-23 school years, which exhausted our reserves, it is imperative to provide a detailed
breakdown of how funds were allocated. This transparency is necessary to rebuild trust and demonstrate a commitment to
responsible financial stewardship, especially when considering future levy requests.
2.<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Jennifer Hickok:As a tax payer I would like a forensic
audit done on the last five years. There are still a lot of questions that need to be addressed. Until that is done I will not be voting yes
on another levy or bond.
