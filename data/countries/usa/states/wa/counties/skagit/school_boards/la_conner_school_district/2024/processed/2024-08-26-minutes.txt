  3. Public Comment:
A. Public Comment Guidelines - We welcome and appreciate hearing about personal or public interest issues from our citizens. The board requires those who wish to speak (but not all attendees) to sign in so that the board has a tally of individuals who wish to speak and can call them forward. When called forward, individuals will identify themselves and proceed to make comments, limited to 3 minutes per person, time may not be deferred during the public meeting and should be presented respectfully. The board is not obligated to respond to questions or challenges during the public comment period. The board’s silence will not signal agreement or endorsement of the speaker’s remarks. The board may control the time, place, and manner of public comment. The chair may terminate an individual's statement when the allotted time has passed and may interrupt a speaker to require the same standard of civility the board imposes on itself.
No public comment was given.
  4. Action Items:
A. Appoint and Administer Oath of Office - Emmalin Goodman and Kellie Cayou-Lockrem to Serve as Student Representatives for the 2024-2025 SY - Director Agen moved and Director Pedroza seconded, to appoint Emmalin Goodman and Kellie Cayou-Lockrem to serve as Student Representatives for the 2024-2025 SY.
Motion carried 3-0.
  President Deyo administered the oath of office to Emmalin Goodman and Kellie Cayou-Lockrem to serve as Student Representatives for the 2024-2025 SY.

Director Agen welcomed student representatives Emmalin Goodman and Kellie Cayou-Lockrem. The board wants you to feel comfortable asking the directors for ideas and how they can best serve successfully in their new role. The board is looking forward to having them very engaged and sharing their input. Although the board will provide some direction, as student representatives, you have a lot of freedom and autonomy to choose topics that you might report to us on or advise us on. The board expects a monthly report on a topic. The first month will be on the cell phone policy. The board will issue a list of topics that they want to receive feedback on around student voice but are open to other ideas from the student representatives.
  Directors Quintasket and Pedroza will schedule an orientation with the student representatives.

B. Adopt 2024-2025 Fine and Fees Schedule – Interim Superintendent, Director of Finance, Human Resources, Operations Dave Cram presented the proposed revision to the fines and fees schedule for the 2024-2025 school year. The two revisions are, the yearbook cost will be reduced from $25.00 to $20.00 and the replacement cost of the Yondr pouch will be added. An actual dollar amount isn’t listed, only replacement cost because the cost could change throughout the year and then we have to keep coming back to the board for approval. The document is available in BoardDocs.
  Director Agen moved and Director Pedroza seconded, to approve the proposed 2024-2025 fine and fee schedule as submitted and presented. Motion carried 4-0.
  5. Discussion Items
A. Update Cell Phone Free Schools - Director of Teaching and Learning Beth Clothier presented an update on the cell phone-free status and shared the information available on our website which includes a list of FAQs broken into 4 sections; parents, students, staff, and Yondr pouch information. https://www.lcsd.wednet.edu/o/lcs/page/cell-phone-free-schools
Below is a summary of the discussion with directors and staff.
1. Community Survey Feedback
Survey Response: As of this morning, 38 responses were received, with a 39th response added today. The feedback reflects general sentiments about the new cell phone policy.
Positive Feedback:
Reduced Distractions: Respondents noted that removing cell phones would lead to less distracted learning and improved social interactions among students.
Decreased Anxiety and Bullying: There is an appreciation for the potential reduction in anxiety, harassment, and bullying.
Concerns Raised:
Communication Issues: Approximately 60% of respondents expressed concerns about family communication, emergency situations, medical needs, and loss of connection.
General Satisfaction: 40% of respondents indicated no significant concerns about the absence of cell phones, suggesting a broad acceptance of the policy.
2. Implementation Plan
Middle School:
Students will turn in their phones at the beginning of the day into locked cases.
Phones will be retrieved from the office at the end of the day.
High School:
Students will use Yonder pouches, which will be issued at the start of the year and kept by students.
Yonder pouches lock phones with a magnet system. Students will tap the pouch on a hub to unlock it at the end of the day.
3. Frequently Asked Questions
Special Accommodations:
Health Concerns: ADA-compliant pouches with Velcro closures will be provided for students with medical conditions requiring phone access. These pouches maintain privacy while meeting medical needs.
Enforcement and Consequences:
Initial Warnings: A three-day training period will be provided to students on the policy.
Penalties for Non-Compliance:
First Offense: The phone will be confiscated and taken to the office.
Second Offense: The parent will be contacted to retrieve the phone and a parent conference will be scheduled.
Subsequent Offenses: Further escalation in consequences, including continued confiscation and additional parent-student meetings.
Educational Approach: The policy aims to teach students appropriate technology use in various settings, similar to workplace expectations.
4. Additional Points:
Potential for Misuse: There is a possibility that strong magnets might override the pouch locking mechanism, potentially damaging devices. This issue will be communicated clearly to students.
Communication Strategy: Emphasize that keeping devices is a privilege and an opportunity for responsible use.
  B. Update Braves' Day Event on September 3, 2024, from 1-4:00 pm – Director of Teaching and Learning Beth Clothier stated that Braves’ Day is very similar to the way that it was last year. Instead of being an all-day event, it's a half-day event from one to four.
  Braves Day will be a great day of learning for all students and families. Our doors will be open from 1:00-4:00 PM. Similar to last year, everyone will start in the elementary gym, which will house all of the welcome tables hosted by our community partners and program coordinators, to learn about all that La Conner has to offer your family in the elementary gym. The fire department is doing ice cream bars.
  Elementary families will then find their child’s classroom, meet the teacher, and learn more about what to expect in the coming school year.

  LCSD is using a different photo company this year, O'Connor Photography. We are no longer using LifeTouch. So, when you get those welcomes and those intro emails, it's not spam.
  C. ALE and LLC – Secondary Principal Christine Tripp presented information about the LCSD alternative learning program which often has a negative perception; however, its core concept is simply to offer a different approach to education. This can involve different timelines, methods, or grading practices. In the alternative learning program, students experience a unique schedule: instead of semester-long classes, they have six-week courses. This structure allows them to focus on one subject intensively for a short period, rather than juggling multiple subjects over an entire year.
  Students in the program will split their day between AM coursework and PM activities. The PM component could involve continuing coursework at the main high school building or at the Career and Technical Academy (CTA), which is the skill center. Alternatively, it could include job or internship experiences. Although the schedule is different from a traditional school, the total instructional time is equivalent to that of comprehensive school students.
  Maddie Huscher is the head teacher for this program and will be supported by additional teachers who will cover content areas outside her endorsement. The program includes interdisciplinary project work, integrating multiple subjects into single courses.
  A question was raised about what happens if a student decides that the alternative learning program is not suitable for them. It was explained that such students would be reintegrated into the comprehensive school if possible. For those significantly behind in credits, alternative pathways or different programs might be considered to help them get back on track. In cases where a student leaves and a spot becomes available, efforts will be made to recruit another student, with a focus on juniors and seniors due to their greater opportunities for work experiences.
  The long-term vision for the alternative learning program includes opening it up to a broader range of students beyond just juniors and seniors. The goal is to make it available to more students through an application process in the future. Initially, however, the priority is to assist students in catching up and graduating on time.
  In the future, the program could also be open to recruiting students from outside the LCSD. Efforts will be made to attract students who are dissatisfied with other alternative programs or who are seeking to join the La Conner alternative learning program.
  Ms. Maddie Huscher has set up the La Conner Learning Community classroom in the district office and invited anyone to visit it following the board meeting.

Ms. Huscher and Mr. Crinklaw, need to ensure compliance with state rules and requirements for alternative learning, particularly in the area of not overwhelming the system in its infancy stages.
  D. Board of Distinction Draft – President Deyo hasn’t started writing the essay to submit for the board of distinction because the topic is too expansive and asked for help from other board directors. Board Director Agen will visit the WASSDA website to start working on a draft essay for the Board of Distinction application that opened on August 1 with a submittal deadline of September 15.
