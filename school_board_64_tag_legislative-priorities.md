The special session of the school board, held on October 3, 2024, focused on several key legislative priorities derived from a survey of Directors. These priorities include Academic Rigor and Equity in Public Education, Amply Funded Staffing Levels, and Support for Special Education Programs, among others. Director Nancy Button will submit these priorities to the Washington State School Directors' Association (WSSDA). Additionally, there was a discussion regarding the authority of the Superintendent, Dr. Kristi Dominguez, who emphasized the need for clear communication and policies to facilitate efficient board operations. 

The board also reviewed the Ferndale School Board Social Contract, deciding to remove specific phrases that emphasized emotional engagement and encouragement. This decision reflects a shift towards a more straightforward communication style.
