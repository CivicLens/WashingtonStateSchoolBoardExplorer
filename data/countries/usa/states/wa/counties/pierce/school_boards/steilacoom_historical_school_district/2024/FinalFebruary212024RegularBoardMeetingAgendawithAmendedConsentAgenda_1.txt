February 8, 2024
To:

Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

From: Shawn Lewis
Subject: Financial Update
Attached are the Budget Status Reports for all funds as of the end of January 2024, along with
charts and data showing our monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund cash
balance.
Enrollment for the year to date continues to be under projection. Enrollment in February has
historically increased slightly but this year we simply maintained overall enrollment. Running
Start winter quarter enrollment is in the process of being verified, and it appears to be down
slightly – but this isn’t necessarily helpful if our overall FTE enrollment only held steady.
General Fund balance as of the end of December was $1,824,291 – which is about $2.2 million
better than last year at the same time. Our end of month cash balance is also roughly $1.4
million higher than last year.
No items of significance to report in other funds.
Overall cash flow remains fine at this point, with March continuing to be our projected lowpoint. December activity was better than expected – so cash balance projections are slightly
improved.
As you know, the State Auditor’s Office has started their work on the 2022-23 school year and
expects to have their fieldwork completed by mid-March.

Director McDonald shared Mr. Emery is a hero for the school district, and thanked him for all
the work he does for our school community.
Director Rohrer thanked Mr. Emery for the presentation and asked if the state is offering any

does its best to capture funding when and where it can.
Director Lewis reiterated the importance of this work, and how it makes the district look great

V. REPORTS - Budget Status Report
Assistant Superintendent Shawn Lewis stated Shae Emery is the best Maintenance and Facilities
Manager he has ever worked with. Mr. Emery has helped the district immensely in so many
ways.
Mr. Lewis shared the budget status reports for all funds as of the end of December 2023, along
with charts and data showing monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund cash
balance.
Chair Scott questioned if the high Running Start enrollment was due to the economy, and
families needing to access free college education for their children.
Director McDonald shared the high school and district are doing great things to bring college
classes into the high school, and those options would be a great opportunity for students to
earn college credits at no cost while also getting their social and emotional needs met at the
high school.
VI. CONSENT AGENDA
Director Tinsley made a motion to approve the Consent Agenda, Director Rohrer seconded the
motion, and the motion passed (5/0). The Consent Agenda included December 2023 and

Tinsley seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
B. First Reading of Policy 5409 Unpaid Holidays for Reason of Faith or Conscience
Executive Director Susanne Beauchaine shared Policy 5409 Unpaid Holidays for Reason of Faith
or Conscience. Per Washington law, each district employee may request up to two unpaid
holidays per calendar year for a reason of faith or conscience or an organized activity conducted
under the auspices of a religious denomination, church or religious organization. This new policy
codifies the process for making this request.
Director Rohrer made a motion to approve Policy 5409 Unpaid Holidays for Reason of Faith or
Conscience, Director Lewis seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
C. 2024-25 Budget Planning
Mr. Lewis shared a presentation providing the board with initial information regarding
enrollment, expenditures, and revenue projects for the 2024-25 school year, along with a broad
timeline for budget adoption. He shared the district expects that some cost reduction steps will
be necessary in the 2024-25 school year in order to rebuild the cash balances in the General
Fund, generally consistent with the four-year outlook (F-195F) adopted by the board last
summer. This information is preliminary and will likely be changed by legislative action. The
district expects to have final state budget impacts in March/April 2024. The district will draft
a budget proposal in May/June and receive public comment. In June/July the district will submit
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No 1 are digitally recorded.

Packet page 91 of 116

the budget to ESD and OSPI for review, and in August present a 2024-25 budget and four-year
outlook for board adoption.
Director Rohrer thanked Mr. Lewis for all his work and asked if the district would be able to do a
ThoughtExchange, asking the community for budget priorities. She also asked for an update on
the Manchester Place property and the impact its sale would have on the budget. Mr. Lewis
shared any sale of real property must be deposited in the Capital Projects fund, and cannot be
deposited into the General Fund. The district has interested parties in the property, but there
are issues with some of the tentative offers at this point. The most possible viable potential
offer would not be complete for some time. Mr. Lewis shared the district can do a
ThoughtExchange prior to February 28 - when the current contract with ThoughtExchange
expires - as the contract will not be renewed. The district has considered other options to
receive community input that would not cost $25,000, which would be the increased cost of a
ThoughtExchange subscription. Superintendent Weight shared the district was previously locked
into a two-year contract, and that is why the district did not end our relationship with
ThoughtExchange in the current year.
Director McDonald suggested the district create a more structured survey to receive community
input, offering realistic options to the community. The district has to be good stewards of
funds. Director McDonald then inquired about admin/staff furlough and if there was a way to
not carry that into future years, so the district does not lose valuable employees. Mr. Lewis
suggested a possible board Study Session in March to get feedback on budget changes after the
district has budget information from the legislature. Mr. Lewis shared the 2024-25 budget does
include making district staff whole who previously did not receive pay increases and willingly
agreed to furlough periods to help improve this year’s budget.
Director Rohrer shared she and Director Tinsley had an audit committee meeting with Mr. Lewis
yesterday, and they also discussed staffing and compensation during that meeting.
VIII. BOARD COMMUNICATION
Chair Scott shared he received a message Sunday morning from Representative Mari Leavitt,
asking for support for HB1956 which will educate students on substance abuse. He shared that
information with other board members, and encouraged them to register their position in
support of this bill.
Director Rohrer thanked Dr. Weight and Dr. Vallieres for organizing the school building tours
focusing on School Improvement Plans and the success of our students. Additionally, she shared
there is legislative discussion regarding reducing the 60% supermajority needed to pass a bond.
She also shared information regarding legislation surrounding restraint and isolation.
IX. ANNOUNCEMENTS
Chair Scott recognized Tina Ridge from Cherrydale Primary School. Ms. Ridge has done an
exemplary job at both teaching her third graders and helping all staff with the school's library.
Her leadership in this area has been tremendous, and all students and teachers in the school
have benefited from her continued efforts to support the library, literacy, and students' love for
books. She is an integral part of the Cherrydale team and the district.
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No 1 are digitally recorded.

and beyond because they genuinely care about students.

CONSENT AGENDA: Out of Endorsement 2023-2024
Strategic Focus Area

☒ Support

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Per WAC 181-82-110, teachers may teach outside of their endorsement area if certain conditions are
met. If individuals are assigned outside of their endorsement area, the following needs to happen:
•
•

•

The out-of-endorsement assignment needs to be approved by the local school board.
The district and the teacher “mutually develop a written plan” for assistance to the teacher. The
plan needs to provide “a reasonable amount of planning and study time associated specifically
with the out-of-endorsement assignment.” Plans might include mentoring, PLC time with teachers
in the content area, taking a course, independent study, and so on. Although it may, the plan does
not have to include acquiring the endorsement.
There are no out-of-endorsement provisions for CTE teachers.

The district has identified one teacher who has been assigned a course that meets the state’s definition
of out of endorsement. While the teacher has previously been endorsed in the subject, and holds
multiple advanced degrees in the subject, he currently does not have an active endorsement. A plan of
support is on file with the district.

☒ Plan
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Sixth grade Outdoor School (also called Outdoor Camp) is a long-standing tradition within the
Steilacoom Historical School District. Board policy 2320 and its accompanying procedure lay out a
number of requirements for an outdoor education resident program to be in place. The first
requirement is to present a plan to the school board for annual approval.
The presentation will provide the board with our plan, including:
• The purpose of Outdoor Education
• The location and dates proposed
• The activities and curricula planned
• The number of students, staff, and volunteers needed
• The cost of outdoor school, and
• Next steps if approved by the school board.
While some details of outdoor camp will still need to be developed, policy requires board approval
of the plan prior to finalizing these details with staff and families.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
It is the recommendation of the Superintendent to approve the presented plan for Pioneer Middle
School 6th graders to participate in Outdoor Camp this spring.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Policy 6550 was a new policy adopted at the beginning of this school year based on a WSSDA
model policy. After the policy was adopted, WSSDA received additional guidance and clarification
from the State Auditor’s Office and is recommending a change to the new policy.
Specifically, this policy revision lowers the threshold for capitalization of technology subscriptions to
$20,000. This is consistent with the capitalization threshold for other district assets.
The district does not currently have any subscription based technology agreements that meet the
capitalization requirements and therefore this will not have an immediate impact to the district’s
financial reporting.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

I move adoption of policy 6550.
Report prepared by:
Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent

Policy: 6550
Management Support

CAPITALIZATION THRESHOLD FOR LEASES AND SUBSCRIPTION-BASED
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ARRANGEMENTS (SBITAs)
The Steilacoom Historical School District Board of Directors acknowledges that the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) has issued Statements 87 and 96, covering
Leases and Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements (SBITAs). Within the
guidelines of these Statements, the district may establish a liability threshold for reporting either
a lease or a SBITA that are considered to be de minimis when compared to the district’s financial
capacity. These leases or SBITAs must have a maximum possible term of greater than one year
to be included.
For the purpose of this policy, the following definitions are used, in accordance with the
Statements referenced above:
1. A lease is a contract which conveys control of the right to use another entity’s
nonfinancial asset for the time specified in the contract for an exchange or exchangelike transaction.
2. A subscription-based information technology arrangement (SBITA) is a contract that
conveys the right to use another entity’s software, alone or in combination with tangible
capital assets, for the time specified in the contract for an exchange or exchange-like
transaction. Software that is insignificant to the cost of the underlying asset is excluded.
The value of leases or SBITAs under this policy will be determined using the methodology
outlined in the original Statements and current accepted industry practice. Each lease or SBITA
will be considered individually.
For capitalization purposes, those leases or SBITAs with a value that equals or exceeds 2% of
prior year expenditures/budgeted expenditures$20,000 and has a maximum possible term in
excess of one year will be capitalized and recorded as a liability on the district’s financial
statements in accordance with the Statements referenced above. Any lease or SBITA that does
not meet this threshold, or which has a maximum term of less than one year, will not be reported
as a liability on the district’s financial statements.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The sound system that has been used for Board meetings has reached the end of its useful life.
We have experienced issues with the microphones and the sound system for several years. We
have also found that our equipment is insufficient to meet the additional requirement to allow quality
video and audio streaming of the meetings.
As we explored options to replace the aging equipment, we identified an option that would
significantly reduce the cost in terms of equipment and of ongoing staff time meeting preparation
and tear down.
If the School Board decided to hold meetings in the District PDC, the district would reduce the initial
equipment expense by roughly $5,000 because of the sound equipment that already exists in the
PDC – purchased just a few years ago.
In addition to the equipment savings, the fixed meeting location is estimated to save staff the
equivalent of $1,350 in staff time per year. This will not be a budget savings – but it will allow
custodial and technology staff to spend more time providing services to schools and students
instead of setting up and taking down the school-based meeting locations.
While these are both relatively small costs in relation to the overall $50 million school district
budget, this seemed like the right time to ask the board for feedback about their interests in
changing board meeting locations to the PDC.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

If the board wishes to change future meetings to the PDC: I move the superintendent be
authorized to take the necessary steps to change board meetings to occur at the
District’s PDC.
If the board wishes to stay with its existing practice no action is needed.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
In late 2023, the Board approved a plan to engage the community in a process to make
recommendations to the Superintendent and Board regarding strategic investments in school
district facilities. Specifically, the committee will make recommendations on the priorities and
funding amounts for future bond and capital levy proposals to meet the needs of students.
At the board’s direction, we solicited for committee volunteers to find 20 individuals who represent a
broad cross-section of the community. We received a very good response and now have 27
individuals who are interested in serving. The volunteers can be categorized in a few ways:
By Geographic Area:
• 3 Anderson Island
• 9 City of DuPont
• 12 Town of Steilacoom
• 3 Lakewood and Unincorporated Pierce County
By School Connection (multiple answers permitted)
• 3 Anderson Island Elementary
• 5 Cherrydale Primary
• 6 Chloe Clark Elementary
• 10 Saltar’s Point Elemetary
• 13 Pioneer Middle
• 8 Steilacoom High
By Connection Type (multiple answers permitted):
• 23 Current SHSD Parents
• 2 Retirees
• 1 AICAB Member
• 1 Children under 5
• 4 SHSD Staff
We are determined to provide all interested volunteers a role in the process, and have a strong
interest in limiting the committee to 20 individuals for efficiency purposes. All others will be invited
to participate in other ways: surveys, focus groups, and feedback sessions. Assistance from Board
members in selecting the final 20 committee members would be helpful to ensure the district is
considering representation appropriately.

We are asking the board to designate two members to be given the authority to review the list and
select the final 20 members for the committee.

I move board members ________________ and _______________ be authorized to
approve the final list of members appointed to the Committee for Strategic Investments in
School District Facilities.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The Board established professional learning goals for the 2023-24 school year based on the most
recent Board self-evaluation process. This agenda item will become a “standing” item at our
Regular Board Meetings to provide an opportunity for Board members to discuss and share around
Goal 1 and Goal 2:
GOAL 1:
By the end of the academic year, each school board member will attend a minimum of three
relevant professional development sessions focused on governance best practices, with the aim of
enhancing their knowledge and skills in effective decision-making. Progress will be measured
through documented attendance records, reflections on key takeaways, and the application of
acquired knowledge in at least one board meeting or policy discussion.
GOAL 2:
Board members will actively contribute to their professional growth and help foster a culture of
continuous learning by committing to read a minimum of one relevant article or book chapter per
month, sharing key takeaways and insights. The chosen readings will directly align with Board
responsibilities, providing insights on emerging trends and successful strategies in the field of
governance. Board members will engage in regular discussions and reflections on the readings
during monthly board meetings.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Discussion Purposes Only – No Action.
