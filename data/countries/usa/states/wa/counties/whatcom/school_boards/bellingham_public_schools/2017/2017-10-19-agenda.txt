Explanation of Issue:
At your June 20, 2017 meeting, information was presented about three district-owned real property parcels that could be considered for
sale.
The first step in the process of moving forward with selling real property is for the board to pass a motion directing the administration to
publish, in a newspaper of general circulation within the District, a notice of the Boards proposal to sell real property.
If this motion is approved a notice will be published in the Bellingham Herald for two consecutive weeks indicating the Boards proposal
to sell the three parcels. The notice will also establish a date and time for a public hearing to determine the propriety and advisability of
selling the property where opportunity will be provided to submit evidence both for and against the proposed sale.
