RE: 5th-12 grade Cell Phone Policy
_________________________________________________________________________
All BISD 5th-12th grade schools have updated their cell phone policies to be in alignment with OSPIs recommendations and
guidelines. The data illustrates the negative impact of cell phone usage during the school day on the learning environment and
students academic engagement. The 5th-12th grade building principals are in agreement with the restricted access and use of
cell phones, bluetooth headphones, and smartwatches in the 5th-12th grade level buildings. Each building will share their
updated policies regarding cell phone use and guidelines.

Re: Superintendent Evaluation Planning, 2024-25
_________________________________________
One of the most important roles of the Board is the annual review of the Superintendent. As such, the Board of Directors and I
met for a Board Retreat on Thursday, September 12, 2024 in order to review the WSSDA Superintendent Evaluation
Framework, and to set my goals for the year.
At the September 26, 2024 Board Meeting, I will present the areas in which I will be evaluated as well as a review and reporting
timeline.

RE: Policy 3205: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of Students Prohibited - Second Reading
_______________________________________________________________________
I am submitting for your review the second reading of Essential Policy 3205: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of
Students Prohibited. This policy replaces current BISD Policy 3700: Prohibition Against Sexual Harassment. The text of Policy
3205 closely reflects WSSDA model policy with a few minor edits.
On April 19, 2024, the U.S. Department of Education released its Final Rule under Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972, the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving federal
financial assistance. As a result, Policy 3700 is now out of date, with Policy 3205 reflecting a complete revision of policy
language to align with the new Title IX Regulation (effective August 1, 2024).
Of note, the new Regulation is ...not retroactive, which means districts must still comply with the 2020 Regulation for any reports
of incidents that occurred prior to August 1, 2024. Thus, districts will need to maintain two different Title IX regulatory schemes,
side-by-side, in perpetuity, which will require skilled Title IX Compliance officers and additional resources to manage compliance
effectively (Policy and Legal News, August 2024).
Navigating the New Title IX Landscape: A Guide for Educators and Administrators - Page 3
Policy and Legal News August 2024.pdf
Additionally, all district employees must be trained on new Title IX guidance. To meet this requirement, all BISD employees will
watch OSPI Training Module 1: 2024 Title IX Final Rules in the first 60 days of the school year.

RE: Policy 3206: Pregnant and Parenting Students - Second Reading
____________________________________________________
I am submitting for your review the second reading of Encouraged Policy 3206: Pregnant and Parenting Students. This is a new
BISD Policy. The language closely reflects WSSDA model policy with a few minor edits.
On April 19, 2024, the U.S. Department of Education released its Final Rule under Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972, the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving federal
financial assistance.
According to OSPI the new rules, ...include antidiscrimination requirements related to parental, family, and marital status, as well
as pregnancy and related conditions. Related to pregnant and parenting students, the rules require schools to provide
reasonable modifications to the schools policies, practices, and procedures as necessary to prevent sex discrimination and
ensure equal access to the schools education program or activity. Examples of reasonable modifications, as well as other
guidelines for supporting pregnant and parenting students, are outlined in the rules
Title IX changes.pdf
To meet the outlined regulations for K-12 schools, Policy 3206 and the accompanying procedure outline the rights of pregnant
and parenting students according to TItle IX.

I recommend the BISD School Board approve the second reading of Policy 3206: Pregnant and Parenting Students.

RE: Policy 5010: Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action - Second Reading
____________________________________________________

I am submitting for your review the second reading of Encouraged Policy 5010: Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action. The
text of Policy 5010 closely reflects WSSDA model policy (updated July 2023) with a few minor edits, serving as a complete
replacement of current BISD Policy (last revised November 12, 2015). Policy 5010 is referenced in the completely revised Policy
5011: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of Staff Prohibited, thus necessitating policy review and revision of BISD
Policy 5010.
Policy and Legal News (May 2018) outlined reason for WSSDA language change:
WSSDA revised this policy and procedure to update legal references and remove unrequired language regarding utilization
analysis. Second Substitute House Bill (SSHB) 1506 revised Washingtons Equal Pay Act, clarifying some of the definitions and
adding some more prohibitions. For example, the Equal Pay Act now clarifies that job titles alone are not determinative in
whether employees are similarly employed. Rather, employees are similarly employed if the performance of the job requires
similar skill, effort, and responsibility, and the jobs are performed under similar working conditions. Although the changes to the
Equal Pay Act did not affect the substance of the existing nondiscrimination policy, we added legal references to reflect SSHB
1506. Additionally, we noted language in the procedure that stated districts would conduct utilization analyses for groups for
which that requirement does not apply, so we removed that language.

I recommend the BISD School Board approve the second reading of Policy 5010: Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action.

Re:

Attached for your review is Policy 6113, Community Use of School Facilities Fee Schedule (last revised May 27, 2021)
incorporating fee updates for individual school spaces available for rental reservation and staff fees directly related to increases
in wages over the last five years.
Substantial research in the form of a comparison of local neighboring district practices and current fee schedules provided the
basis for this fee structure. The proposed fee schedule has been further refined by analysis of utility data and staffing levels
since the last revision of the overall fee schedule on February 14, 2019.

I recommend the board approve the proposed fee schedule for the second reading.

Capital staff are working with the City of Bainbridge Island Public Works Department to prepare bid documents for the
Woodward Middle School Solar Installation Project. Staff are coordinating with Woodward staff and the CTE Department
to develop student learning and participation opportunities as a part of the project.
DA Hogan and Associates are working with Capital staff to finalize a permit package for the installation of a field lighting
system for both the multipurpose and synthetic turf fields at Woodward Middle School. The project has been reorganized
into three potential phases with the first phase of installing synthetic turf within the track already having been completed.
Hargis Electrical Engineers are preparing to conduct a district-wide lighting upgrade design that will incorporate a holistic
transition to LED lighting. Initial calculations would suggest an overall reduction in power consumption of eight to twelve
percent or $85,000 per year in utility savings. Included in the project is an inventory of all lighting fixtures, bulbs, and
lighting control systems. Capital staff anticipates obtaining substantial incentives from Puget Sound Energy if the potential
project is conducted.

Contractors from Morgan Sound Inc. are preparing to upgrade the existing BHS Paksi Gym audio system. work is
scheduled to begin on September 30th with substantial completion achieved by October 4th.

to minimize disruption to the Ordway, Commodore, and BHS communities during the Madison Ave improvement project.
The BIMPRD is working with Facilities staff to minimize disruption and expedite essential renovations taking place at the
Ray Williamson Memorial Pool.
Transportation
Transportation staff are preparing to begin classes for three new driver candidates. The process will take approximately
six to eight weeks to complete.
Student ridership is down by approximately two hundred students compared to this time last school year. There is
sufficient time for ridership to increase before the submission of our Student Allocation Reporting System (STARS)
submission on October 31st.
Maintenance and Operations

Custodial staff are settling into a routine school year schedule and are assisting building staff as needed and necessary
to support all programs.
Facilities staff have been working to ensure the successful surplus of outdated fitness center equipment in preparation for
the delivery of new equipment donated to the high school campus by the football boosters.
Maintenance staff are preparing to address the BHS 100 aluminum exterior doors by refitting them with surface mounted
hinges to address sagging and hinge fatigue from over extension.

1. General Fund
a. Commentary
b. Summary of Revenues and Expenditures
c. Budget Status Reports for All Funds
d. Monthly Financial Statement
Commentary:
Revenues:
Year-to-date (YTD) revenues for the district through August total $63,346,475, which is 2.5% higher than the same period
last year, highlighting consistent revenue streams despite an evolving fiscal landscape.
Local Property Taxes collected YTD amounted to $10,335,101, slightly under projections by 0.7%, but
demonstrating the continued strength of our local tax base.
State apportionment collections stand at $38,027,921 reflecting the lower than budgeted enrollment for the year,
and mid-year legislative changes to funding for classified staff and MSOCs.
The district has seen an increase in Special Purpose State Revenues, which exceeded budget projections by
$277,076, due to additional support for special education programs in the form of Safety Net, and other
categorical funding.
Revenues for August totalled $6,706,242.
Expenditures:
On the expenditure side, the district successfully adjusted mid-year to align its spending closely with budgeted amounts,
ensuring effective use of resources.
YTD expenditures total $64,630,270, representing a 2% increase from the previous years expenditures, largely driven by
rising costs in purchased services and salary increases for certificated employees.
Regular Instruction costs for the year are nearly on target at $33,760,781, achieving a 99.26% execution rate,
while Special Education Instruction costs have exceeded projections slightly at 107.45%, reflecting the growing
demand for and cost of specialized services.
Expenditures for August came in at $4,875,458, which is 5.7% higher than in August 2023. This was to be expected with
the large expenditure total that was moved to fiscal year 2023-2024 at the end of August 2023.
There are accrued expenses still to be accounted for in the final financial statements.
Fund Balance:
The ending fund balance in the General Fund currently stands at $4,205,176. This will adjust downward with the processing of
the remaining accrued expenses.
