## 2024-11-01 - FERNDALE_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Ferndale School District No. 502 held a special session on January 24, 2023, to discuss the filling of a vacant school board director position (Director Position No. 3).  The vacancy arose from Jessie Deardorff's resignation on November 20, 2022. The board outlined the process for filling the vacancy as per Policy 1114P, which required selecting five candidates from the applicant pool for interviews. However, the board struggled to reach a consensus on five candidates and ultimately voted to suspend policy 1114P to interview only four candidates: Cindy Cultee, Katie Dorr, Patricia Dunn, and Toni Jefferson. The decision to deviate from the established policy highlights potential challenges in the board's selection process and the need for clear communication and agreement among members.  The board received significant parental feedback via email regarding the candidates, which influenced their decision-making process.
