Public Content
SITUATION
RCW 28A.600.200 authorizes school district board of directors to control, supervise, and regulate the

cultural, social, or recreation nature for students in the district. RCW28A.600.200 further authorizes
school district boards of directors to delegate such responsibilities to a voluntary not for profit entity. Lake
Washington, like most districts in the state, has traditionally delegated such responsibilities for athletics to
the Washington Interscholastic Athletic Association (WIAA). The WIAA staff administers Association
policies, rules, and regulations and provides other assistance and service to member schools. This
includes rules regarding coaching, eligibility, residence, and program requirements; school transfers;
season length and practice regulations; etc. The WIAA coordinates state level playoff events.
In addition to WIAA, the district works closely with KingCo for the coordination of regular season games
and officials as well as the organization and logistics of post season conference level playoffs. KingCo is
an organized not-for-profit organization. KingCo follows the rules and regulations of the WIAA. This
delegation needs to be voted on annually by the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors approves Resolution No. 2368 delegating responsibility for post season
conference level play to the KingCo Conference.

In order for the district to seek state construction funding assistance, the Office of the Superintendent of

The district completed a remodel vs. rebuild study to determine whether to remodel the existing school
building or rebuild a new school. The study was originally conducted in 2018 by McGranahan Architects
and was re-examined by BNBuilders in 2024. The study updated the cost to reflect the planned date of
construction and current educational specifications. The cost of modernizing the existing building was
found to be approximately 1% more than the cost of constructing a new school. Based on this analysis
BNBuilders has reconfirmed the 2013 recommendation to replace in lieu of modernization.
The attached resolution affirms that the district will construct a new school in lieu of modernizing the
existing building and, once completed, the existing school will not be used for instructional purposes.

Situation
The Lake Washington School Board met on December 4, 2023, during a study session and
again on January 22, 2024, during a study session to review operational expectation polices OE3, Treatment of Community Stakeholders, and OE-9, Communication and Engagement with the
Community. The Board considered the benefit of having these two policies consolidated and
discussed its values related to community engagement and experience. The Board was
presented with frameworks related to best practices for community engagement and examples
of how different public agencies across the country have incorporated those frameworks into
policy. As part of the overall policy review, the Board of Directors asked to have a single policy
developed to incorporate the Board's values related to Community Engagement and
Commuinication. Policy revisions were presented to the Board for first reading at the April 15,
2024 Board meeting. Staff indicated that the Board would be presented with consent agenda
items to (1) adopt a revision of OE-3 and (2) discontinue OE-9.
Recommendation
The Board of Directors discontinues OE-09: Communication and Engagement with the
Community.

Recommended Action :

Approve the recommendation from the Social Studies
Curriculum Selection Committee to adopt the materials that
have been approved by the Instructional Materials
Committee: Inquiry Journeys from InquirEd.

Public Content
SITUATION
During the 2022-2023 school year, the K-5 Social Studies Adoption Committee (from here forward being referred to as the K-5
Social Studies Curriculum Selection Committee) engaged in professional learning, reviewed research and standards, and
developed rubrics to use for the evaluation of various social studies curricula. These rubrics included: Effective Practice
Alignment, Standards & Assessment Alignment, Organization and Design & Digital Resources all of which were informed by the
OSPI Anti-Bias Tool.
During the 2023-2024 school year, the Committee heard presentations from LWSD directors, evaluated curricula for social
studies using collectively developed rubrics, heard presentations from publishers, piloted materials in classrooms, and narrowed
options to a final recommendation for grades K-5 on April 25, 2024.
The districts Instructional Materials Committee reviewed the materials at its March 7, 2024, meeting. The titles were then
submitted to the Board on March 25, 2024, as part of the IMC Board Reports.
An opportunity to give written feedback was provided for public review and comments on instructional materials under
consideration for adoption. Materials were on display in the lobby at the Resource Center from January 11 March 15, 2024 and
all community members were able to review and comment on materials online for that time. Caregivers were sent a letter if their
student was in a pilot classroom. A community information night was also held on January 25, 2024 after being advertised via
the letter sent home to pilot classroom caregivers, Parent Square, the district website, and Connections.
Social studies teachers will have multiple opportunities to participate in professional development in social studies standards,
effective instructional practice, and curriculum materials. This learning will be a collaborative effort involving multiple departments
to ensure district initiatives and priorities are cohesively woven together for staff within implementation. Training through
professional learning sessions will begin in August during LEAP days and will continue throughout the 2024-2025 school year.
Teacher and student materials will be accessible and online in August 2024. The curriculum materials will be implemented in the
2024-25 school year.
