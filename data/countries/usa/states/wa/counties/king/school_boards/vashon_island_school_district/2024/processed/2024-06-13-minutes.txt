  Martha Woodard
Acknowledged that lately board has spent much time talking about primary school, and wanted to make sure that secondary schools are included in terms of discussions regarding curriculums and budgets.

Does not think it is healthy to engage in social media. If something needs to be discussed, discuss it in the meeting.
  Report

  Explained QSCB loan and rebates.
  Board members engaged in discussion about QSCB loan and rebates
