AGENDA ITEM:

Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

services. The district solicited a proposal for CA services from BCE Engineers, Inc. BCE is the

along with their experience, makes them uniquely qualified to oversee this project and provide solesource Construction Administration services.
The districts Technology Operations department recommends the board approve option 1 of the attached
BCE proposal which covers all Construction Administration activities including:
Perform weekly site visits during the 59-week duration of construction for this project between July
1, 2024, and August 21, 2025.

governance (Davis-Bacon).
Schedule and oversee weekly or bi-weekly owner, architect, contractor (OAC) meetings.

Coordinate with District security and IT to ensure each school and phase of the project is
meeting district security procedures.
Respond to contractor RFIs remotely and by visiting the sites as needed when questions arise to
develop an acceptable solution for the district.
Work with the district IT and Security departments to identify ideal outlet termination locations for
security devices as identified on the plans.

Kent School District Communication Platform Software Agreement with Apptegy
AGENDA ITEM:
To support communication systems coherence and improve the accessibility of information and services
by communicating with families in their home language, a priority initiative was identified to evaluate and
implement enhanced tools for unified communications.
A team of twelve staff members representing Athletics & Activities, Communications, Customer Support
Center, Data Services & Support, Information Technology, Interpretation & Translation Services,
Principals, Public Records, Software Review Committee, and Teachers have met since November 2023

to actualize this priority initiative. Over twenty requirements were identified as necessary to improve
family and staff engagement encompassing school and district websites, mobile app, social media, mass
communications including robo calls, email, and text, school and classroom communications with twoway translation capabilities.
The team researched tools and identified three companies for demonstrations. From the demonstrations,
two companies were chosen for user testing conducted by district and school staff and parents. The
recommendation from the team after user testing is Apptegy. This tool can be translated into 130
languages and means that our families will have one trusted source of communication, instead of
checking multiple platforms. Apptegy also provides unlimited 1:1 training and support for the lifetime of
the agreement.
The implementation of this tool will impact communications across the district including translation
services. The tool can create newsletters, forms, and surveys and translate into 130 languages with the
push of a button. Apptegy provides an advanced translation service to ensure quality translations. Over
4,000 school districts across the nation have implemented Apptegy including Spokane Public Schools in
our state.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 2: Expanding Student, Family, and Community Partnerships
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
The recommended vendor has provided a service agreement to include Mobile App Development,
Custom Web Development, Alerts, Publishing Platform with two-way messaging, and Training for a total
of $63,500 under the 2023-24 Communications Budget for development and $159,650 from the 2024-25
Technology Subscription Budget for continuing use.
RECOMMENDATION:
The board of directors approves the acquisition of the new communication platform software agreement.

Print Shop Equipment Acquisition and Maintenance Service Agreement
AGENDA ITEM:
The print shop currently has a lease agreement that includes three MFDs (multi-functional device) with
QBSI-Xerox Financial Services that expired February 2024 with a month-to-month option. The district is
considering three options; start a new 5-year lease agreement with new equipment, purchase the old
equipment from the original lease or purchase new equipment.
Data considerations: buy-out cost, useful life based on the depreciation schedule and the number of
service calls. The district concluded that the color MFD; Versant 180 still had 2-4 years of useful life
before the machine may not be serviceable. The two currently leased black and white MFDs; D125CP
would not be a good investment as they have currently surpassed the depreciation schedule, which
aligns with the high number of service calls that both machines are receiving monthly. To align with the
printing needs of the district, we are proposing purchasing the previously leased color MFD and
purchasing two new black and white MFDs.
All three MFDs will begin a new 5-year maintenance agreement which will include all parts, labor, drums,
and supplies including staples. The supplies included align with our current maintenance agreement for
the fleet. Both the print shop and the fleets supply list exclude paper.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
BUDGET IMPLICATION:

The recommended vendor has provided a bid under the national cooperative OETC Contract
(Organization for Education Technology and Curriculum) Contract Title #OETC-22B-PrintServices-CTXXerox in the amount of $79,148.72 plus tax. This purchase will be funded by the 2023-24 printshop
budget.
RECOMMENDATION:
The board of directors approves the acquisition of the copier equipment and the 5-year maintenance
service agreement.

Asset Preservation Program
AGENDA ITEM:
To protect the public capital investment of all post-1993 state assisted facilities through appropriate levels
of maintenance, and to be eligible for future state capital funding assistance, the district adopted
Resolution No. 1341 on December 9, 2009, that shows the districts commitment to maintain the school
facilities to a safe and healthy standard through the implementation of an Asset Preservation Program
(APP).

As part of complying with the APP, the district committed to assessing the condition of the APP schools
annually and report the findings to the Board of Directors. Additionally, every six years a certified (last
conducted in 2021) Building Condition Assessment (BCA) scores must be submitted to OSPI.

The facilities team sees no immediate maintenance issues that would affect the safe and healthy
operation of the schools.
