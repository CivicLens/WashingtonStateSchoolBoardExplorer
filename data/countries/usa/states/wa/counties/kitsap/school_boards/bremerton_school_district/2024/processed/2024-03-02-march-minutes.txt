Director Bolton-

e

March zth is Sine Die

o

Senate Bill 5462- AN ACT Relating to promoting inclusive learning standards and instructional materials

in public schools. This bill states it would require school districts to adopt policies and procedures,
including the histories and contributions of marginalized or underrepresented groups.

o As the legislative session progressed and the number of bills continued to be pared as cutoff deadlines
arrived, most of the school district advocates narrowed our focus on four key issues: MSOC,
Paraeducators, Pupil Transportation, and Special Education.
eo

MSOC allocations were increased to $28.81 per student

o Appropriations Committee-adopted the minimum staff allocations for paraeducators, office support and
non-instructional aides from 0.068 to 0.076.
o HB 2180 and SB 6014, which would increase the cap to 17.25 percent. The Senate’s budget provides
funding to increase the cap to 15.6 percent. An amendment is waiting for action that would move the
cap to 16 percent.

o Legislators provided funding in the budget to assist school districts in transporting “special passengers”
(special education students; homeless students under the federal McKinney-Vento Act; and foster
students). The bill dies without further action.

Director Rotter chaperoned
