CONSENT AGENDA
Prior to consideration of the consent agenda, the board discussed Item 2.4 – Approve
Updated Policy 2410 – High School Graduation Requirements. At the board’s request,
Dr. Baker described the communications and decision-making processes for the proposed
revisions. He said hundreds of hours of research and gathering feedback preceded the
final decision. In discussing the research, recommendation, and communications process,
he referenced the work of the High School Schedule Implementation Advisory Group and
the Superintendent’s Blog, which provided updates throughout 2016, including a High
School Schedule Update in early December. He said while there is no perfect schedule,
this one has many benefits; and future refinements can always be considered following
implementation.
Following the discussion, Mr. Benjamin said that under the district’s policy governance
model, items on the consent agenda are delegated to the superintendent. He said as board
president he is considering, going forward, the requirement for the board to vote to pull
an item from the consent agenda for purposes of discussion.
Ms. Diaz Hackler then made a motion, seconded by Ms. Bashaw, to approve the
following consent agenda. Motion passed unanimously.

POLICY GOVERNANCE REVIEW
GP-8 Board Member Code of Conduct – Revisions to the Governance Process (GP)
policies are part of a broader sub-committee review that will be considered by the board
at a later date. To comply with provisions of GP-8, the board agreed to affirm and sign
the policy as it is currently written, with one revision – Item 1a (Board members agree to
uphold the WSSDA Code of Governance) will be deleted, as the WSSDA Code of
Governance no longer exists.
Ms. Peterson asked that the board note the reference to meaningful dialogue in Item 3h of
