The board welcomes input from the public.www.mlsd161.org/apps/pages/schoolboard
In accordance with the Open Public Meetings Act, the board is not allowed to discuss items that are not on the agenda. The board will direct
the superintendent to follow up on any items that arise during public comment as appropriate. However, you should not expect a response
from the board members in reference to your public comments during the meeting.
----- Written Comment(s) ----Karlye Shank--I appreciate the hard work that everyone has been doing to make sure our district can weather the storm that has

been brought upon us due to community decisions, errors in financial management, and other issues.
When viewing the results of the survey sent out 5/17, I could clearly see that this community values extra-curriculars. But, I want
to point out that that did not seem the case when the levy was run twice and failed twice. While I think the management of the levy
could have been better, it is important to remember that our community already was surveyed, and they chose their own money
over school activities funded by the levy. It is a lot easier to say we value extra-curriculars and school activities when it is no skin
of the community's back (i.e. the survey sent out last week, 5/17). But the community was already polled and determined to be
unwilling to fund extra-curriculars. The community did not put its money where its mouth is. Please keep that in mind when
moving forward with your plans.
Another comment about the levy vote vs. the survey that was made during the meeting was there may have been more people
responding to the survey than those that voted in the levy. I want to inform you that there were not more responses to the survey
than to the levy. The April 23, 2024 MLSD levy vote had 8054 total votes that were able to be counted (https://results.vote.wa.gov
/results/20240423/grant/), whereas the survey sent out on 5/17 had 5578 responses(as stated in Carol Lewis's presentation on 5/22).
I ask that you do not start to believe this survey represents the community better than the levy results.
I do want to mention that Carol Lewis has been doing a wonderful job so far of trying to build up trust with both the community as
well as the staff of the school district. I hope that the transparency continues beyond any problems our district is facing and into
fairer weather.
Loren Sandhop also has my admiration for reminding the community and Board that extra-curriculars do not just mean sports, and
for stating that he will try to be fair when making cuts in extra-curriculars at the meeting on 5/22. I am biased in this, as I
participated in band, choir, theater, knowledge bowl, and key club while at Moses Lake High School (2015-2019), so it warms my
heart that Loren would acknowledge these activities and I hope he keeps his word on being fair with budget constraints.
I want to state that these comments and opinions are my own and do not reflect that of the school district.

----- Written Comment(s) ----Steve Wells--It is a shame that these kids are having to come in demonstrate and explain what they are learning and hoping that

their program wont be cut. I applaud them for their presentations and speeches.

You all need to go our new High School (AS PER Bond Passage)VANGUARD and see what those kids are really learning.
Eric Edward Stones--Dear Moses Lake School District Board of Directors (I am in Amy's District),
As a former member and president of the MLSD Board of Directors I appreciate the wonderful opportunity you have to serve the
voting public. It is also a great responsibility. As one who provided input regarding the hiring of Monty Sabin I am surprised to
learn that he has not worked out to your satisfaction. I thought him highly qualified to work with the school board in leading the
district.
A good superintendent is the best resource you have when operating a school district (of any size). I am not inviting you to
reconsider your decision to place Monty on Administrative Leave. However, I am encouraging you to humbly take counsel from
the Cabinet and others who are there to help run the day to day operations. Trust and collaboration are key to working together.
Best wishes as you navigate these tricky waters. May God bless your honest efforts to assist the wonderful task of providing
quality education to our children and youth.
Best wishes, Eric E. Stones

20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Has anyone looked and asked ourselves is it necessary to have a
principal at each school. We have 4 schools within a 1/4 mile of one another. Other schools are with a mile of another. If the
Certificated & Classified are going to have to take on more work so should the Administration & District.
Maybe some of that savings to go programs that would be saved?
