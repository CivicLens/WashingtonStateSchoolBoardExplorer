RE: Larrabee Overnight Field Trip
For the past 10 years, Larrabee third, fourth, and fifth graders have attended an Environmental Learning
Center at Cornet Bay. This year, rather than attend the ELC at Cornet Bay, I am requesting permission
for Larrabee fourth and fifth graders to attend an overnight field trip at Camp Lutherwood on Lake
Samish. Students will take a BSD bus to the camp on the morning of June 9 and will return to Larrabee
via a BSD bus on June 11. The cost of the program will be $35 per student, and the Larrabee PTA will
provide scholarships for families who need financial assistance. All Larrabee fourth and fifth graders will
be able to attend.
After researching the program at Camp Lutherwood, the Larrabee Staff and PTA believe that Camp
Lutherwood offers a better educational program than Cornet Bay. For example, Camp Lutherwood has
aligned their lessons with several of the Washington Essential Academic Learning Requirements. The
lessons will emphasize the concepts of: Energy Flow, Bio-diversity, Sustainability, Interrelationships of
Living Organisms, and the Water Cycle. These are all concepts that our fourth and fifth graders have

been learning in class, and this field trip will allow them to apply their classroom learning. On the last day
of the field trip students will complete a service learning project that is aligned with science concepts
learned the previous two days.
Board Policy 2320 will be followed for this field trip and Denise Suess, BSD Risk Manager, has reviewed
the liability release form to be signed by Larrabee families.

and Recovery Efforts Update

Meeting :

May 13, 2010 - Regular Meeting 7:30 p.m.

Reports

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent
Explanation of Issue:
As you are well aware, during the early morning of November 5, 2009, a fire caused significant damage
to the structure, finishes, building systems, and contents of Whatcom Middle School. Since the loss, the
emergency services design team, Reid Middleton, has been working closely with the emergency services
contractor, Dawson Construction, and the insurance companys technical consultant, Madsen Kneppers &
Associates, to assist the Bellingham Public Schools in their emergency response and recovery efforts.
Initial work to date has included damage documentation; evaluation of the structural stability and safety of
the building; material testing; cost and phasing studies; and design and permitting of various temporary
structural shoring systems and concepts to improve the stability of the damaged building and to reduce
the likelihood of additional loss or damage to the property, bodily injury, or loss of life.
Since the building is still in a fragile state, the exterior wall system and select areas of the interior framing
present a potential collapse hazard to those needing to access the site for fire recovery operations,
additional assessment, and planning activities. These hazards include the partially collapsed roof and
attic-level framing, the unstable and fragile unreinforced masonry walls in the interior and exterior of the
building, and floor framing systems that were damaged as a result of the fire. The District is currently
taking steps to mitigate these hazards including the installation of shotcrete walls along the exterior and
interior of the building (while maintaining the existing architectural features on the south Halleck Street
side of the building), removing all building contents, and completely removing all existing interior
structural framing systems and replacing them with a structural steel framing systems. This will leave a
safe shell and core in place for the rebuilding portion of the project.
Dave Swanson and members of the Reid Middleton team will present a report including photographs and
schematics depicting our work to date and work planned for the upcoming months while the rebuilding
portion of the project is being designed. Construction of the rebuilding work will commence once the
emergency services work has been completed, hopefully in late fall 2010.

Explanation of Issue:
As we have previously discussed, we are slated to sell the final $14 million of unlimited tax general
obligation bonds associated with the successful 2006 $67 million bond issue on May 13. The first $53
million of bonds were sold in 2006 ($33M), 2008 ($10M) and 2009 ($10M). This current sale will be
structured as Qualified School Construction Bonds (QSCBs) meaning that 100% of the amount of each
interest payment on the bonds will be paid by the federal government and not our local taxpayers.

Another way to think of this sale is that we will be borrowing $14 million to construct the elementary
school on Aldrich Road interest free. By utilizing these QSCB bonds, we will save our local taxpayers
between $2.5 and $3.0 million.
On the day of our Board meeting, May 13, 2010, D.A. Davidson will be marketing these bonds on the
national bond market. I will attend and participate in the sale.
At the Board meeting on May 13, I anticipate presenting to you an offer (Bond Purchase Agreement) for
the sale of these bonds. At that time you will have the opportunity to approve the offer in order to
complete the transaction by adopting Resolution 6-10. The specific financial details of that proposal will
not be known until the sale occurs on May 13. Mr. Jack Eaton, representing D.A. Davidson, will attend
the Board meeting to present the Bond Purchase Agreement and the final Resolution 6-10 for Board
action.
A draft Resolution 6-10 is attached for your review.

Explanation of Issue: Baseline Certificated Staffing Ratios

Per our previous discussions, Brett Greenwood and Ron Cowan have reviewed the budget and affirmed
that the 200910 K12 baseline certificated staffing ratios can be maintained for 201011. Therefore, Budget
Savings Item No. 27 will not be implemented. This was reviewed with the Staffing Committee at its
meeting on April 20, and committee members concurred with this recommendation.
The attached chart incorporates the updated ratios. I am requesting that this change to the K12 baseline
certificated staffing ratios for 201011 be submitted to the School Board at its regular meeting on May 13,
2010.
Thank you.
