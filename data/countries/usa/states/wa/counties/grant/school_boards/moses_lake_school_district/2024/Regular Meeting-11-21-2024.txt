1. Esther Pigg:*
Hello School Board, My question is regarding why all the new hires? New hires are directly related to student enrollment and
looking at reports and hearing from schools, numbers are down or near capacity. When the superintendent submitted the financial
statement in August, the statement said that there would be no hiring of classified or certified staff for the next 2 school years.
What are the numbers that are demanding new elementary school teachers? Especially when the district already sends kids to the
partner school when the residential school is at capacity. Since attending the financial and other meetings we know that the district
previously hired all the time without sufficient need, I would love to see numbers showing the new need for the new hires for the
past month or so. Thank you for your time
