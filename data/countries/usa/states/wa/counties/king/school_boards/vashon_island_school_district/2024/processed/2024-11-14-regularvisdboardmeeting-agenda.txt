Public Comment: The Vashon Island School Board recognizes the value of public comment on educational issues. We are
pleased to provide the opportunity for addressing the board during regular Board meetings. Public comment is not taken
during Board work sessions or special meetings. The agenda limits the public comment period to 15 minutes. Community
members who wish to make a public comment must complete the sign-in sheet upon arrival and will be called to speak for
the allotted 3-minutes in the order they sign in. Consistent with our equity policy, there is no mechanism whereby a speaker
can donate some or all of their time to another speaker. As a matter of practice, the Board will listen to all comments,
however, will not respond to comments or engage in dialogue at the meeting.
Community Input: The Board also encourages community input at any time on educational issues. The public is welcomed
and encouraged to provide community comments in email to the VISD School Board atvashonschoolboard@vashonsd.org.
In accordance with the Open Public Meeting Act, any individual who has difficulty attending an in-person meeting by reason
of disability, limited mobility, or for any other reason that makes physical attendance at a meeting difficult, they may request
an opportunity to provide verbal comment remotely. Pleaseclick hereif you would like to provide comment remotely. Remote
requests must be submitted by 12:00 pm, the day of the board meeting.

Board Member Resignation, Policy 1114 - Position #2 Kaycie Alanis
Policy 1400:Matters requiring board action will be placed on the meeting agenda for a First Reading to introduce the issue for board
consideration. Before being decided by the board, matters must appear on the boards agenda at a subsequent meeting for a Second
Reading. The Second Reading will serve as the time for discussion, amendment and final consideration. The Board may suspend the
practice of First and Second Reading by unanimous consent when members of the public are unlikely to be interested in the issue, when the
issue has previously been discussed by the board or when delaying a decision would have an adverse impact on the district. The Board may

suspend the practice of a First and Second Reading when taking action on Collective Bargaining Agreements with Vashon Education
Association (VEA), Vashon Educational Support Personnel (VESP) and Service Employees International Union, Local 925 (SEIU).
