Submitted by:
Dr. Chrys Sweeting, Superintendent
Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulg√°b).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time
immemorial and their ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice
the traditional ways of their ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural
traditions passed on to them by their ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these
lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its
Indigenous people, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.

A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history,
and can demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.

N. Emergency School Closure Waiver
Request

Meeting :

May 13, 2024 - Board of Directors Regular
Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approve the Emergency School Closure
Waiver Request as presented.

Public Content
Submitted by:
Dr. Chrys Sweeting, Superintendent
Background Information:
As part of the basic education requirements in Washington State, each school district must make a minimum of 180 school days available to
students each school year. School districts must also provide at least 1,000 annual instructional hours to students in kindergarten through
8th grade, and at least 1,080 annual instructional hours to students in grades 9-12 or a district average of 1,027 hours in grades 1-12.
Occasionally, unforeseen emergencies can cause a temporary school closure because the facility is unsafe or inoperable, and school
districts may request an emergency school closure waiver from the 180-day school year requirement. The Office of the Superintendent for
Public Instruction (OSPI) provides a request form for this process. School districts must still meet the average annual hours of instruction
requirement of 1,027.
Administrative Considerations:

On January 16, 17 and 19, SVLC was closed due to frozen water pipes. On January 19, Eagle Creek
Elementary was closed due to no power. All schools were closed for inclement weather on January 18,
and will make up this day on June 17, 2024. Even with the closures, the district will still meet the average
annual hours of instruction required.

Background Information:
Board Procedure 6114PGifts orDonations states that the Board will approve donations of $5,000 or more and the Superintendent will
approve donations of $1,000 or more but less than $5,000.
The Board, however, is very appreciative of our generous community, PTAs and Booster Clubsand for all donations made to our schools
and programs, and therefore, has requested to be formally informedof donations valued at $1,000 or more.
Administrative Considerations:

Donations valued at $1,000 - $4,999.99 will be presented to the Boardin an informational report the month following receipt so that they may
be publicly acknowledged and theBoard may share its appreciation.
In April 2024, I approved the following donations:
Donation from Pioneer PTSA to Pioneer Elementary in the amount of $2,478.92 for 6 iPads and 6 3-Year AppleCare Plans for use in
the library.
Donation from Pioneer PTSA to Pioneer Elementary in the amount of $1,378.44 to purchase a projector for use during assemblies,
staff meetings and events.
Donation from Pioneer PTSA to Pioneer Elementary in the amount of $1,807.35 to purchase vinyl-wrapped bulletin boards.

Public Content
Submitted by:
Dave McKellar, Director of Special Education; and
Krissa Cramer, District Nurse
Background Information:
Each year, our district is required to submit to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), an accounting of the number of
nurses/health services employees we employ, their training background, as well as the number of students we have serviced through our
health rooms. This report also asks for the types and number of students we serve who have chronic health conditions and the types of
medications and treatments we manage and administer through our health rooms. Tonight, Krissa Cramer, our District Nurse, will provide an
overview of this data and an overview of the work that has been occurring in our health rooms.
Administrative Considerations:
This is just an opportunity to share the volume and type of health related services that are provided to our students district-wide on a daily
basis and the complexity of this work. The number of students with both significant and chronic health conditions continues to grow with our
health rooms running at full capacity.
In recognition of National School Nurses Day that was on May 8, we would like to thank all of our nurses and health room assistants!

Submitted by:

Goal 2: Safe and Caring Environment

Brian Lewis, Executive Director of Operations
Background Information:
Between 2018 and 2024, Arlington Public Schools has proposed several bonds to construct a replacement building for Post Middle School.
Each time, the proposed bond has not achieved the 60% voter approval to be considered passed. District administrators are presenting an
alternative to bonds to support the construction of a new Post. The proposed alternative is a capital levy question on the November 2024
general election ballot.
Administrative Considerations:

Documents attached to this agenda item are:
Draft Capital Levy Resolution 5.5.24-The draft resolution describes how the district determines the
need for a replacement school building, describes needed funding to support construction of a new
building, and shows the annual estimated rate per $1,000 of assessed valuation, as well as the
annual collection amount associated with the levy.
Presentation to Board re Post Capital Levy Proposal 5.5.24 - a powerpoint presentation describing
aspects to be included in the consideration of a capital levy for the construction of a replacement
Post Middle School building.
Budgetary Impact:
None associated with this discussion. If the board does decide to place a capital levy on the ballot, election costs will have to be paid for by
the district following the election.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:

An election calendar is included in the presentation attached to this agenda item.
