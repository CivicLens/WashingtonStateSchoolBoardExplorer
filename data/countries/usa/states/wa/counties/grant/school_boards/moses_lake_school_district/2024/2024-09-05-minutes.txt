    5. New Business
Action (Required Approvals): A. Facilities Rate Schedule
Ms. Lewis offered updates regarding the rate schedule, including brainstorming with a multitude of community members while still covering operating costs. She noted a district is not in the business of making money, but we do need to cover incurred expenses. Current policy states a school district employee must be on site at all times, so there are considerations to take into account as costs incurred with the rate table.

Ms. Lewis also noted that we have in-kind donations with some community groups, so we can look for ways to offset costs by using these donations strategically.
