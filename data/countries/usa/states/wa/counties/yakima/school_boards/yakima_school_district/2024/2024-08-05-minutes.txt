Mr. Kuper, Assistant Superintendent of Finance, addressed the attached action letter and Resolution 07.23.34. He noted that mid-year savings options are limited, with a proposed reduction in force and a voluntary 5-day furlough for admin, along with a freeze on vacation cash-outs. September cash flow is impacted by 9 optional workdays paid in that month.
He outlined 39 FTE reductions as per union agreements, clarifying that no paraprofessionals will be RIF'd, but will be reassigned. Currently, there are 52 classified staff members, with efforts ongoing to fill all positions.
President Walker inquired about administrative overload, recalling that we should aim for around 9% administration, with 12.5% as the state level maximum.
Mr. Kuper discussed reduced MSOC budgets and financial protocols established prior to the reductions, including downsizing credit cards to control monthly spending of approximately $200k. He emphasized the need for timely PO confirmations and adjustments to supplemental contracts to ensure work is not completed before approval. Contracts with outside vendors have been renegotiated, especially as ESSER funding concludes, necessitating better deals. Additionally, efforts are underway to secure grants for upgrading outdated HVAC systems as part of a multi-pronged strategy to reduce spending.
