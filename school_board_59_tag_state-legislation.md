The Spokane Public Schools Board of Directors held a regular meeting on March 20, 2024, where several significant topics were discussed. The meeting included a presentation on the adoption of a new secondary world history curriculum by Stephanie Kerwien and Susie Gerard, which aims to create continuity in teaching for grades 6, 7, and 10. The Board also reviewed updates from the Washington State Legislative Session, with a focus on various proposed legislative priorities, including mental health supports and counseling access, which the Board did not support co-sponsoring until further clarification was provided. Other legislative proposals discussed included support for literacy initiatives and the establishment of an African American Studies Workgroup, both of which received Board support for co-sponsorship. Additionally, Vice President Slagle highlighted concerns regarding low family engagement in the Native Education program and the desire for more culturally specific clubs within the district, reflecting the Board's commitment to diversity and inclusion.
