Start time: 06:35 PM
Kindergarten and Transition-to-Kindergarten classes began the school year by hosting individual student/parent meetings with
their teachers. These meetings allow teachers and parents to share information and collaborate to ensure a smooth transition
into the school environment. Each student is assessed during the meeting and results allow their teacher understand how to
best serve them. These meetings set the foundation for a successful school year for our youngest learners.
Lynden Middle School welcomed over 700 students this school year! Their back-to-school night is tonight and the staff is
looking forward to engaging with their students and families.
