The Yakima School District Board of Directors held two significant meetings in July 2024, focusing on budgetary concerns and special education services. During the Special Board Meeting on July 9, the board discussed the current financial situation, including the impact of a Reduction in Force (RIF) and ongoing budget challenges, particularly in special education. Superintendent Dr. Trevor Greene emphasized the need for effective systems to support special education students and outlined strategies for community engagement and long-term financial planning. 

In the Business Board Meeting on July 30, a public hearing was held regarding the Preliminary Budget for 2024-25, which was projected to have a $3 million deficit. Assistant Superintendent Jake Kuper advised against approving the budget in its current form and committed to presenting a balanced budget for approval at the next meeting. The board also reviewed a Special Education Services report that highlighted compliance and inclusion efforts for diverse learners, with plans to improve IEP compliance and support services. No executive session was needed during the business meeting, and various consent agenda items were approved, including personnel actions and budget status reports.

It was noted that no district business was conducted during the event, indicating a focus on community engagement rather than formal board actions. The attendance of three board members suggests a commitment to supporting local events, although the absence of any policy discussions or decisions may reflect a prioritization of ceremonial participation over governance during this occasion.
