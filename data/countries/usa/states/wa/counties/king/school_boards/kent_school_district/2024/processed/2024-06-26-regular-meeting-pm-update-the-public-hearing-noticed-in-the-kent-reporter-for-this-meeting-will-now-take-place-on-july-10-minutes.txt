AGENDA ITEM:
Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

2023 National Board-Certified Teacher Recognition
AGENDA ITEM:
The National Board-Certified Teacher program began with a landmark report in 1983 titledA Nation at
Riskdetailing concerns in education that threatened Americas future. In response, the Carnegie Forum
on Education and the Economy convened a task force of policymakers, educators, teachers
associations, and business leaders. InA Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century,the task force
called for strengthening standards in teaching and professionalizing the teaching workforce. In 1987, the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was born.
National Board Standards were created by teachers for teachers and based on five Core Propositions.
National Board believes higher standards for teachers means better learning for students. It is the gold
standard in teacher certification and is offered in 25 certificate areas. National Board-Certified Teachers
are nationally recognized as being among the best teachers in the profession, and they comprise
approximately 3 percent of the national teaching force.
This certification process involves a demonstration of the candidate's teaching practice as measured
through a two-part assessment:
A portfolio of videotaped classroom teaching, lesson plans, and student work samples to show
the teacher's impact on student learning.

Demonstration of subject-area knowledge, classroom practices, curriculum design, and student
learning through a written assessment.
Candidates typically invest 200-400 hours in portfolio activities. Kent School District (KSD) partners
with the Kent Education Association to provide support for teachers choosing to pursue the certification
process.
National Board Certified Teacher Facilitators:
Stacey Gruenich, New Teacher Mentor Program Specialist with the Kent School District, became
a National Board-Certified Teacher in 2011.
Ryan Chinn, Science Teacher at Kentwood High School, became a National Board-Certified
Teacher in 2008.

National Board-Certified Teacher in 2014.

Professional Services Agreement between Hazel Health and Kent School District
AGENDA ITEM:
Kent School District is requesting approval of $300,000 to continue Hazel Health mental health and
physical health services to all of our schools. This will mean that all schools in the district will have access
to some level of mental health and physical health services.
Hazel Health responded to our RFP on February 28, 2022 and was selected as one of the agencies to
provide mental health services. The current contract is set to conclude on August 31, 2024 to ensure
continuity of services for students over the summer months.
Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, there has been an increased need for alternative delivery models for
mental health services. In person mental health services positions have become increasingly difficult to
fill, and there is a need for more students to have access to this service. Hazel Health can work with
students before, during, and after school hours. Hazel Health allows us to provide mental health service
across the entire district, which is not possible with in-person service.
The Hazel Health contract will be funded with basic education funds managed by the Community
Partnership team to support all schools for 12 months. This request will support all of our students mental
and physical health for just $1.00 per month each.Per Board policy 6220, we are bringing this contract to
the board for approval to support the 2022 RFP for mental health services.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 1: Preparing Students to be Global Citizens
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
The 2024-25 Hazel Health contract in the amount of $300,000 paid for by basic education funds
managed by the Community Partnership Team.
RECOMMENDATION:
That the board of directors approves this item.

AGENDA ITEM:

OSPI requires annual school board approval of the districts Highly Capable Program Plan, which includes
information about the services that will be provided. The Highly Capable funding formula is based on 5
percent of each LEAs population. This is a funding formula and does not mean a certain percentage of
students must be identified. In past years, OSPI funding was accessed through an iGrant application,
however OSPI has shifted to a required survey.
The Highly Capable funds are used for extra pay for attending teacher professional development that is
focused on differentiation in the classroom and serving the needs of the Highly Capable Program,
purchasing textbooks and additional enrichment materials such as Wordly Wise, Depth and Complexity
Differentiations kits, any supplementary, extension and enrichment materials, contract professional
development with Gifted schools such as College of William and Mary, and Whitworth. The funds are also
used for personnel at the district office who support Highly Capable teachers, students, and parents.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 1: Preparing Students to be Global Citizens
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
$874,001.00 funded by the Highly Capable state grant. This amount is based on the original estimate of
student enrollment for the 2023-2024 school year. The amount could go up or down based on student
enrollment.

Wireless Network Expansion at Secondary Schools
AGENDA ITEM:
As Kent School District evolves in its educational methodologies and embraces technology-driven
learning environments, the need for robust and reliable wireless connectivity has become increasingly
critical. Considering this, the KSD IT department intends to purchase 126 additional wireless access
points to enhance coverage and capacity in key common areas across our secondary schools, including
multi-purpose rooms, performing arts centers, gymnasiums, and cafeterias. This will coincide with the
secondary school data cabling improvements previously approved by the school board. The importance
of wireless network expansion includes:
Enhanced Learning Opportunities:
Collaborative Learning: Modern educational approaches emphasize collaborative learning. With
adequate wireless coverage, students can engage in group activities, access online resources,
and participate in interactive learning sessions seamlessly, regardless of their location within the
school.
Digital Resources: Many educational resources are now available online. Robust wireless
access ensures that students and teachers can reliably access these resources, facilitating
enriched learning experiences and broader access to information.
Supporting School Functions:
Events and Assemblies: Common spaces like multi-purpose rooms and performing arts centers
often host state testing, events, assemblies, and presentations. Reliable wireless connectivity in
these areas ensures that digital presentations, live streaming, and other online functionalities can
be supported without interruption.

Physical Education and Extracurricular Activities: Gymnasiums and sports facilities can

Physical Education and Extracurricular Activities: Gymnasiums and sports facilities can
benefit from enhanced connectivity, supporting activities such as digital fitness programs, online
research for sports strategies, and real-time access to educational content.
Supporting Community Engagement:
Our schools often serve as community hubs, hosting events and activities beyond regular school
hours. Enhanced wireless connectivity supports community engagement by providing reliable
internet access for events, meetings, and other community activities held within our school
facilities.
This purchase was made through the NASPO Cisco (WA) Contract #: 05819 cooperative purchasing
agreement. Board Policy 6220 Purchasing and Contracting Bids and Contracts allows the District to
leverage cooperative purchasing agreements to satisfy competitive bidding requirements.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
