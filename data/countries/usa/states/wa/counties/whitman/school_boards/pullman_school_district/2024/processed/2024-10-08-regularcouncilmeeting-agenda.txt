Recommended Action :

Approve a motion to authorize the amendment of the
existing contract by one year, including a Maintenance
Service Plan, to continue support of Pullman Transit's CAD
/AVL system.

Public Content
Pullman Transit has had a fixed route CAD/AVL/GPS and passenger counting system
on its buses since at least 2011. This system allows staff to schedule routes on set
frequencies, see the bus locations on screen, and automatically count passengers at
the door.As a result, the public can also track their bus locations and next stop times,
as well as see how full the approaching bus is.
The contract for the associated current hardware, software, and annual fees was
awarded via an RFP process to Syncromatics (now GMV Innovating Solutions) in
2017. Because the system continues to work well, and the City now owns the
hardware, staff prefers to continue the contract via annually paid service fees only,
with an annual maintenance service plan.
The proposed contract amendment, and associated annual quote, are attached as
Exhibit A. Staff requests approval to continue the service through January 2026.

that occurred during construction and to solicit pricing for said changes. This change
order also accounts for various items of work that were unanticipated and completed
on a force account basis by the Contractor. This includes removal of contaminated
soils where encountered on the project.
Change Order No. 4 has been prepared and is attached to this staff report. Please
refer to the attached summary of work items for more detail on each of the items in
Change Order No. 4. The Public Works Director has approved and signed Change

Recommended Action :

By motion, adopt the attached authorizing execution of a
Local Agency Agreement Supplement No. 1 and an
updated Project Prospectus for the Citywide Intersection
Improvement Project.

Public Content
The Citywide Intersection Improvements project includes installation of new traffic
signal controllers and cabinets, flashing yellow arrows, leading pedestrian intervals,
12-inch signal lenses, reflectorized backplates, internally illuminated street signs, new
signal timing plans, and accessible push buttons at nine traffic signals in Pullman.
At their April 16, 2024 regular City Council meeting, Council authorized the execution
of a Project Prospectus and Local Agency Agreement for this project, which initiated
design work. Subsequently, during design contract negotiations with the Consultant
selected for this project, the cost estimate to complete the design work for the project
was updated to reflect the actual design scope and fee. The design fee increased
above the Citys estimate by $5,800. This is attributed to the work necessary to
develop new signal timing plans during the design phase of the project, which will be
implemented during the construction phase of the project.
Staff now seeks to increase the design funds for the project, which is the purpose of
this Local Agency Agreement Supplement No. 1 prepared for Council action. An
updated Project Prospectus is also included for Council action, which is required
when requesting changes to the Local Agency Agreement.

Staff recommends a motion to approve the amendments
to Pullman City Code Section 11.28 as presented.

Public Content
As the Pullman Project Downtown nears completion, the issue for businesses on Main Street to
have outdoor seating on sidewalks needs to be addressed. The proposed amendments to
Pullman City Code 11.28, Obstructions to Streets and Sidewalks, are designed to make the
permitting process more streamlined and simplified for businesses intending to resume or begin
outdoor seating.
Due to contract restrictions and liabilities issues, any new permits on Main Street cannot be
effective before Project Downtown Pullman is completed in full.
The three most notable changes to the amended code section 11.28 are:
The Mayor, rather than the City Engineer, is responsible for the final approval of permits.
The required deposit has been removed.
The permit fee schedule isset by resolution - consistent with other fee schedules across
the organization, rather than by ordinance.
Sidewalk maintenance requirements can be located in Pullman City Code 11.42 and can be
found here:Ch. 11.42 Sidewalk Cleaning | Pullman City Code (municipal.codes).

Sidewalk maintenance requirementsare in Pullman City Code 11.42, which can be
found here:Ch. 11.42 Sidewalk Cleaning | Pullman City Code (municipalcodes).
The current formula for calculating lease agreement fees is requested square feet
multiplied by $0.50 multiplied by the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) divided by
the CPI of June 2014. The proposed resolution simplifies and streamlines the permit
fee to $1.00 per square foot of right-of-way. The permit can be renewed after each
year.
Attached is the permit to occupy the right-of-way and an exhibit to assist in the
completion of the permit for sidewalk seating.
An annual permit fee of $250 or less avoids excise tax on leased public property
under RCW 82.29A.130(8).
By comparison, the City of Spokane requires $300.00 for the initial review of the
permit with $250.00 annually thereafter. The City of Moscow requires a one-time $25
application fee with an additional inspection fee of $125, and annual renewals are
$30.
