  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Reports
Brief reports were provided by administrators from the following schools:
Blaine Primary School: Dr. Craig Baldwin started by commending Lindsay Nowakowski and Michelle McKeown for their assistance with PreK-5 administration. Dr. Baldwin has met with Primary School staff this month and drawn key themes which will drive their efforts moving forward. The Primary School PTO's annual coin drive fundraiser will take place in the coming month. A monthly newsletter will start in February to strengthen communication with families. The school's counselor and behavior specialist have been working together to review safety and behavior expectations with students utilizing the "3 BEs".
Blaine Elementary School: The MLK Jr. assembly was rescheduled to January 24 due to snow. The school's current social and emotional learning attribute focus is "empathy". On January 27, Primary and Elementary staff received a full day of instruction on the topic of Conscious Discipline, with Middle School staff participating for part of the day. President Gibson asked Dr. Baldwin about the challenge of being the principal for both the Primary and Elementary schools and discussion followed. Dr. Baldwin hopes to achieve better alignment in the PreK-5 system, and he again commented on the support provided by Ms. McKeown and Ms. Nowakowski.
Blaine Middle School: Mr. Darren Benson commented on the engagement of Middle School staff in the Conscious Discipline training. The school's annual lib dub video is now available and a link was provided from his report. The school's "Make a Change" coin drive raised over $2,000 for the Blaine Food Bank, and Mr. Benson referenced the Food Bank's buying power to procure significant food with those funds. A "Strengthening Families Program" is happening again this year with twice the number of participating families (8 total) as last year. A third round of clubs is now underway and continuing to build community in the school.
Blaine High School: Mr. Scott Ellis described the ASB's annual Blood Drive which took place in December and included over 50 donations. The TSA club's Cancer Awareness Week raised $1,700. Teachers have been participating in math and literacy training this month, and the school is working towards curriculum alignment for all 9th Grade English classes. An appeal to the WIAA was successful, resulting in Blaine Borderite athletics being allowed to compete at the 1A level for the next two years. Upcoming events at Blaine High School include Coaches vs. Cancer and a MLK Jr. assembly that was rescheduled due to snow.
  B. Teaching & Learning Report: Middle/High School Improvement Plan Updates
High School Principal Scott Ellis and Middle School Principal Darren Benson each provided the board with mid-year progress reports on their respective school improvement plans.
  Mr. Ellis referenced the goals that were presented in October and described the school's progress in the past three months. He described increased rigor and addressed its application to quality (not quantity) in student work. Related increases in student agency and ownership were noted, particularly in the area of literacy. Mr. Ellis demonstrated the "power zone" teaching position and described how its use has been more effective than traditional lecturing as observed in walkthroughs. Student achievement data was summarized, including areas in need of improvement, and the IMPACT re-engagement program was reviewed.

The Middle School's focus on attendance has been impacted by high rates of illness in the past couple of months. Mr. Benson described the school's efforts, as a bridge, to support student transitions from 5th to 6th grade and then from 8th to 9th grade. CEL training in math was provided for 6-12 teachers and helped to align teaching strategies in both schools. AVID program development and goals were reviewed. Significant, measurable growth has been noted in reading and responding to complex informational texts. Background was provided for assessments in both ELA and Math.  Classroom walkthroughs were reviewed and questioning examples were provided.
  C. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment for the months of December and January. Ms. Porter also provided an overview of each section on the report, as well as a description of the counting methodology. Enrollment in January has increased with an overall total of 2,218.97 FTE which is about 9 FTE above budget. This increase will help the district's overall average, and Ms. Porter explained the corresponding impact on state funding revenue. Discussion followed regarding state reporting protocols, and President Gibson requested that the budget enrollment amount be included with future monthly reports for comparison. Director Nunamaker asked about the impact of poor attendance in off-campus college programs and discussion continued.
  D. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a review of revenue and expenses for the months of November and December. Each section of the report was described, as well as routine revenue and expenditure trends. Ms. Porter explained how the new funding structure resulting from the McCleary case differs from prior years which currently makes it difficult to compare annual trends.
  E. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update on current district activities.

Blaine Middle School has again been recognized with a Gold Star award for College Bound Scholarship signups. Dr. Granger drew a parallel to FAFSA completion at the high school level which had a 91% completion rate for the Class of 2017.

Dr. Granger explained that the basis of Blaine High School's successful appeal to WIAA, of its 2A classification, was consideration of students in alternative programs which should be counted separately from the school's general education students. Within the next two years, further analysis of this will be done by an outside party to determine whether or not a separate high school entity is needed.

Dr. Granger expressed public appreciation for the collaborative efforts of Facilities Supervisor Alan Pomeroy and Transportation Supervisor Rachel Hrutfiord who assisted in evaluating road conditions throughout the district during winter weather conditions in mid-January. He also commended the City of Blaine for servicing streets around the school to keep the roadways passable.

Levy information has been mailed to all Blaine School District residences and extra copies are available in school offices.

A calendar committee is reviewing options for the 2020-2021 school year, including consideration of built-in snow days during the calendar year so that dates can be determined early for graduation and the last day of school.
  Punch list work is ongoing at the Grandstand project and Field Turf installation is still on target for an April 1st start date. An opening ceremony will likely take place in August once both are completed. The district will meet again with Field Turf next week to review requirements, specifically those imposed by the city and state, and more information will be provided to the board at the February meeting.

On the Consent Agenda, the board will be asked to take action to authorize architect selection by district staff. Dr. Granger described an update to Procedure 6925P Architect and Engineering Services which removes the requirement for review by the full board in the selection process. He clarified that the selected architect will work with the district as needed on projects in the next five-year period and discussion followed. When the district takes on another large project, an RFP process will be used for that project's architect selection. Later in this meeting, the board will also take action on first reading updates to the bid requirements policy.

In the coming weeks, the leadership team will review potential staffing adjustments, and Amber Porter will provide a 2020-21 budget development update at the February meeting.

Dr. Granger reminded the directors that they will meet at Point Roberts Primary School for the March meeting.
  A brief review was provided for the following public education topics represented in current legislative bills:
Extension of College in the High School to 9th grade
Removal of hurdles (without a funding mechanism) for students who cannot afford ASB and athletic participation costs
Phase out of odd-year elections which would impact school levies and bonds. There is concern that school matters will be pushed even further down on the ballot
A requirement that members of the mandatory For and Against committees must be able to vote on the issue
Impact on districts required by SEBB to pay premiums for employees who have declined coverage, as well as substitutes and coaches
Minor increase for Special Education funding
President Gibson asked for a printed copy of Dr. Granger's report.
