Recommended Action :

By motion, ratify Change Order No. 1 to Contract 2302, Terre View & Crestview Paths.

Public Content
Contract 23-02, Terre View & Crestview Paths, consists of constructing the following:
Terre View Path 1,200 linear feet of 12-foot-wide hot mix asphalt (HMA) path along the
south/eastbound side of NE Terre View Drive from NE Merman Drive to NE North
Fairway Road.
Crestview Path 890 linear feet of 12-foot-wide HMA path along the south/eastbound side
of SE Crestview Street from S Grand Avenue to SE Thompson Street.
Associated project work includes constructing concrete curb and gutter, concrete sidewalk, and
modular block retaining wall; installing two (2) rectangular rapid flashing beacon (RRFB) solar
pedestrian crossings systems; pavement striping; relocating and installing permanent signage;
and other miscellaneous related work.

This change order deducts $176,524.00 from the original contract amount, resulting in a total
adjusted contract price of $1,040,675.00. See the attached Change Order No. 1 for reference
and a full description of all contract changes. The change order primarily addresses a
substitution of black vinyl chain link fence for pedestrian railing, as was previously discussed at
the April 16, 2024 City Council Meeting when initially awarding the contract. Refer to this link to
view that previous regular agenda item, with a detailed narrative therein regarding the
justification for this design change. The cost savings realized with this change order is consistent
with that previously projected.
Funding for this project is from the Arterial Streets Fund, with $750,000 covered by a
Transportation Improvement Board (TIB) Complete Streets grant.

Plant.

Public Content
At theirAugust 9, 2022 City Council meeting, Council authorized and designated Gooch Thermal
Inc. as the sole source provider for the Primary Digester Heat Exchangers at the Waste Water
Treatment Plant (WWTP) in accordance with the procurement procedures contained in Pullman
City Code 1.107.110(3).
A capital improvement project to replace the aging heat exchangers at the WWTP has been
approved and is budgeted for 2024. The heat exchanger provides heat for the digestion process
needed to meet State of Washington Department of Ecology biosolids permit requirements. It is
important that the city maintain the time and temperature requirements via the digestion
process, so the biosolids can be disposed of each year.The only direct replacement option for
the heat exchanger is the Gooch model 1000K by Gooch Thermal Systems Inc, which is the
current heat exchanger model. In order to use a different heat exchanger make and model, the
piping and pump configuration at the plant would need to be redesigned and reconstructed,
which would be far more expensive and time-consuming than replacing the existing heat
exchanger with the same make and model.
Attached is a quote for purchasing the heat exchanger from Gooch Thermal Systems Inc. of
Whitehall, PA.
Staff recommends a motion to approve the sole source purchase of a replacement heat
exchanger that is identical to the existing heat exchanger and authorize the Mayor to execute a
contract with Gooch Thermal Systems, Inc.
Cost Summary:
Equipment: $59,000
Shipping: $3,240 (20% added for contingency)

Recommended Action :

Authorize Transit staff to apply for funding assistance for
two new electric buses and planning and design work
associated with a new Transit facility.

Public Content
Pullman Transit relies on a combination of WSDOT and FTA grant funding as part of
ongoing revenue projections. The consolidated grant process is preferred by staff,
with access to well established federal funding programs.
Staff intend to apply for two grants, and seek Council input and direction.
Planning assistance for the 30% Design and National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) phases, associated with a new Transit Facility
Staff are requesting $360,000 (80% of the total proposed $450,000 cost)
to complete these required planning and design phases, next steps
following a completed Transit Facility Master Plan in 2023, and an active
grant-dependent Transit CIP project.
Capital procurement assistance for two electric buses in Pullman
Staff are requesting $2,360,000 (80% of the total proposed $2,950,000
cost) to purchase two electric buses. This application would bring the
seventh and eighth fully battery-electric buses into service in Pullman,
representing one-third of the entire fleet. The cost estimate includes the

bus AVL/GPS, video surveillance, farebox, paint or wrap, and charging
station. Purchasing two buses on a two-year cycle is part of the Transit
CIP strategy, and if the costs increase significantly staff will return to
Council to request a budget amendment
The notice of funding opportunity is currently active, with applications for funding
assistance due on September 17th, 2024. Staff is seeking Council input and direction
to proceed, and any applications prepared as the result of this direction will be
brought back to Council for review before they are submitted.
