4. Reports
a. Superintendent
i. Year-End Budget 21/22
Director of Finance, Ben Thomas, presented the board with an executive
summary, finance/accounting, enrollment & fund balance for year ending
August 31, 2022 which has been closed out. The summary also included a budget
status report, revenue breakdown expenditure breakdown, and staffing
information for year ended August 31, 2022. He concluded the presentation with
a financial performance & outlook, and budget review for 21/22 and upcoming
22/23 and 23/24.
ii. City of Lynden- Right of Way
Superintendent David VanderYacht, along with City Administrator, John Williams
Public Works Director, Steve Banham presented the board with information on a
proposed agreement regarding the right-of-way at the corner of Bradley Road &
Vinup Road and Bradley Road along the high school property’s northern border.
The city is working with the district to obtain a right-of-way for school-owned
property (NW corner), and in order to widen the road and put in the sidewalks,
they need a slope easement to mitigate the transition from the sidewalk to the
district’s parking area. Part of that agreement is a reconfiguration of the current
parking area in order to keep the same number of spots that we currently have.
The city needs to have right-of-way first before applying for federal money. The
district is currently working with legal counsel on finalizing logistics on
agreement. We should have a finalized plan by the December meeting.
iii. Strategic Priority: Family & Community Partnerships
Superintendent David VanderYacht informed the board about three key
superintendent advisory groups that have been formed:
- The Facilities Planning Committee is made up of citizens who submitted
application indicating their interest to serve on this committee. It also includes
some staff members- they will work with David to review proposed upcoming
facilities upgrades and concluding with a presentation to the board in January.
- The Community Connections Team is made up of community members who
submitted application indicating their interest to serve on this committee. They
will meet through the end of the school year. The focus will be on the strategic
priorities.
