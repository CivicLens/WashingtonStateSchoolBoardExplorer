9. Board Workshop
Bond Resolution Planning
Superintendent VanderYacht shared a summary of the work done by three facilities planning
committees since January 2023. He shared highlights of the Facilities Planning Committee report
that was presented to the board on January 26, 2023 which included recommendations for
building condition improvements, added learning spaces, collaborative learning spaces, and
recommendations to expand community engagement. That committee also recommended the
creation of a long range facilities planning committee and a bond planning task force.

Superintendent VanderYacht then reviewed the findings and recommendations of the long range
facilities planning committee which included the construction of a new high school to house 1140
students, renovation of the gymnasium, a performing arts center at the high school, and several
other items at the elementary schools, and middle school, as well as a plan for a 4th elementary
school in future years.
He then explained that the bond planning task force used the long range plan to come up with a
short term recommendation regarding a potential bond resolution. We are now in a place where
we are considering a potential bond resolution, the scope of work to include in it, and when to
present it to the community if the board decides to move forward with a bond.
He then shared an updated tax analysis from the information that was presented at the August
31, 2023.
He then explained how the cost of $150,000,000 for a new high school was estimated. Two
reference points were used- a professional estimate from a third-party company, and a square
footage analysis in comparison to Ferndale’s cost to build a new high school in 2022. The
average between the professional estimate and the $/SF estimate is $155,522,343.
Superintendent VanderYacht shared a model bond resolution so that the board could read what
would potentially be included in a bond resolution.
Discussion by the board was then focused around scope, timing, and cost.
Director Hickman expressed her concern regarding approving a bond resolution during a
recession, and what impact that may have on financially struggling families in the community.
Director Petersen expressed that the needs have been presented and that the goal of the board
should be to present the needs to the community. It will be imperative to have students involved
in that communication, as well as parents. We can meet the needs of the district facilities, and
pass the bond if we present it correctly.
Questions were discussed such as what kind of schools do we want our children to be in 5 days a
week? We need to focus on safe and secure learning environments that prepare them for the
future.
Discussion was also held regarding “safety” and what that means. It could be argued that
mental health services are more important than entry points as far as safety is concerned. Ashley
McClaran with OAC Services pointed out that the new high school would include spaces that
would be able to provide mental health services to students. Those were services that were not
included in a standard school design 40 years ago. We need to be able to provide the
appropriate spaces for counseling and other services that we now provide to students.
Director Vis expressed that we really need to begin focusing on the cost proposition, and that we
should strongly consider asking for a lower amount while making sure we build an adequate high
school.
Student Board Representative Kyle Tucker expressed his concern with the safety of the current
high school, but also acknowledged Director Hickman’s concern about the financial impact to
individuals within the community should a bond pass.

Superintendent VanderYacht clarified that if the board’s desire is to have a bond on the February
2024 ballot, there is a need to decide on a bond amount and finalize a scope of work to allow
enough time for information to be shared with the community.
He also reminded the board about the consideration of impact fees.
WSSDA General Assembly
Director Hickman facilitated discussion regarding the upcoming General Assembly scheduled for
September 22nd and 23rd with the goal of identifying positions of the board in which there is a full
agreement or disagreement on WSSDA’s position recommendations.
The bylaw regarding the removal of weighted votes was agreed upon to vote to pass. It was
noted that a weighted vote will not be taken for this bylaw.
It was decided that four position proposals warranted further discussion:
Position Proposal #8- Physical Crisis Intervention
The board decided to withhold voting on this as they could not come to a unanimous agreement.
Position Proposal #27- Equity Based K-12 Education System
The board decided to withhold a vote on this as they could not come to a unanimous agreement.
Position Proposal 34- #Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety
After discussion, it was decided that the board agrees with WSSDA’s recommendation and will
cast a “yes” vote.
Position Proposal #39- Student Civil Rights
WSSDA recommends “do pass”. After discussion, Director Hickman asked if she could contact
Tukwila School District and/or WSSDA to ask for clarification on why they put this new proposal
and what the goal is in passing this proposal. She will contact the board via email before General
Assembly with more information about this proposal.
Discussion was then held on how to handle amendments during General Assembly. There is
unfamiliarity on how amendments will work so we are electing not to vote on amendments.
Director Hickman will provide feedback about the process for amendments and be able to
prepare the board for next year.
10. Public Comment
An opportunity was given to the audience to comment on the board workshop regarding the
potential bond resolution.

A community member stated that the dynamic of this community may impede the passing of a
bond- specifically the presence of a large private school. But, we need to let the voters decide.
A community member and BPTF member explained that mental health was taken into
consideration when coming up with their recommendations. That includes natural light, common
spaces for connection. The current structure and space can be very isolating and depressing for
students.
A community member and BPTF member reminded the board that the struggling families are the
exact families that will benefit the most from a new school with more resources. With regards to
mental health, safe and private spaces are needed for students who are going through an
emotional situation during the school day. She also stated that we don’t want to underestimate
costs and have to come back and ask the community for more money.
A community member asked questions regarding the financing of the bond. She also stated that
transparency will be very important to the voters.
A community member expressed that he came to tonight’s meeting against the bond, but after
listening to the background and the work that has been done by these committees, he now
understands why a bond is needed. It is a sacrifice that we need to make for our community.
A community member asked questions regarding scope of work and how the board plans to run
an effective campaign.
A community member and BPTF member clarified the sense of urgency that is needed,
specifically regarding the security of the campus. However, there is a much higher hidden risk
concerned with mental health. The physical school is a space that students should be able to feel
pride in attending and include spaces that are a benefit to mental health such as common
spaces, natural lighting, and a more modern facility. He also expressed that the board should be
unapologetic in asking for the needs of students. Community members have chosen to live here
in large part due to the educational opportunities that Lynden has.
A community member expressed that having a positive environment for students is so important
for their mental health.
A community member expressed that financial stress is going to be very impactful for many
people. She asked that the board makes sure that the bond addresses only urgent needs. She
also asked that the board considers waiting a bit longer to present a bond to the community
voters until we are potentially in a better position economically.
A community member expressed his concern over lack of labor and the importance of career and
technical skills. He said that we need better spaces, better equipment and better schooling to
prepare students for the work force.
