Explanation of Issue:

On June 27, 2013, the board adopted Resolution 14-13 which, among other things, specified the eligible
capital improvements that could be implemented using proceeds from the 2013 bond issue. The purpose
of this evening's public hearing is to take public testimony, both for and against, a proposed amendment
to Resolution 14-13 which will allow bond proceeds to be used to start work on projects identified in the
2018 bond measure.

Bonds from the 2018 authorization will be issued later in the year to fund these projects. The proposed
modification to the resolution is being recommended to begin work on projects approved by local voters
under the 2018 bond measure.
RCW 28A.530.020 requires a public hearing prior to amending the list of eligible projects associated with a bond issue.
This public hearing will be followed by a regular board meeting, beginning at 6 p.m., during which the board will take action on the
proposed amendment.
