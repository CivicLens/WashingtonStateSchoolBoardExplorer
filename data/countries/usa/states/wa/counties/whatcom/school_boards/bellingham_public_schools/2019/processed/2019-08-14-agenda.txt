Meeting :

Aug 14, 2019 - Regular Board Meeting with
Public Hearing

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached agreement with City of
Bellingham Parks and Recreation in connection with the
interlocal facilities use of City and district owned properties.
As Superintendent, I have reviewed and approved this
contract and am submitting it as a consent item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent, Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
The interlocal agreement covers the use of facilities between the Citys Parks and Recreation Department and the District. Since the 1989
agreement, which this replaces, facilities, fees, and the uses of facilities have changed. Nonetheless, since both entities serve the residents
of the City of Bellingham and there are benefits to ongoing use of facilities by each other, we have collaborated on a new interlocal to
encourage use of each others facilities. The agreement impacts the school district operations in two ways. First, this brings greater clarity to
facility use by establishing fees that may be updated through regular cycles and clarity in booking terms and conditions. Second, the district
will take on responsibility for scheduling all district facilities and maintaining all aspects of district fields including baseball mounds. The City
has been scheduling district athletic and recreational facilities. Some of these changes have been incremental as we have worked on the
agreement, so the district has developed capacity to support the changes in our uses of city facilities and to work with community members
who use district facilities.

There are several small buildings associated with the Squalicum High School Turf Fields Phase 2 project including storage buildings,

The architects will soon be completing the construction/bid documents for these buildings, and we will be ready to provide them to
prospective contractors. Prior to doing so, we need board authorization to call for bids on this project.
I request the board authorize the calls for bids for the outbuildings associated with the Squalicum High School Turf Fields Phase 2 project.

As part of the bond approved by voters on February 6, 2018, an auxiliary gym will be built at Shuksan
Middle School.
At the February 27, 2019, meeting we shared the site and floor plans along with several exterior
renderings of the new gym.
Zervas Group architects will soon be completing the construction/bid documents for the new gym, and we
will be ready to provide them to prospective contractors. Prior to doing so, we need board authorization to
call for bids on this project.
I request the board authorize the calls for bids for the Shuksan Middle School Auxiliary Gym project.

Explanation of Issue:
As you know, over the past few months we have been working with our legal counsel on a Purchase and
Sale Agreement to acquire property in Barkley Village for our new district office.
The proposed agreement contains all the major provisions we identified as critical in moving forward with
the purchase, including price; ability to connect to Barkleys existing storm water system at no cost;
relocation of existing easements, if necessary to facilitate the construction of a new building; and an
adequate feasibility period giving us the ability to terminate the agreement with no loss of earnest money
if, at our sole discretion, we determine the property is not satisfactory.
By approving the Purchase and Sale Agreement, you are authorizing the Superintendent to execute all
necessary documents to effectuate the purchase of the property and to agree to any non-monetary
modifications to the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
I recommend approval of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
The proposed agreement is attached.

Explanation of Issue:
On July 10, 2019, you approved the sale of the West Maplewood parcel to Kulshan Community Land Trust (KCLT). Their offer was subject
to a 75-day feasibility period contingency. They have notified us that they are exercising the feasibility contingency and have withdrawn their
offer.
We now have another offer on the West Maplewood parcel. It is a $110,000 cash offer from Sunny Properties 1 LLC (Sunny Bains) with a 60day feasibility period contingency. You might recall that Sunny Properties 1 LLC tendered an offer for consideration on July 10, 2019, that
was lower than the KCLT offer.
The West Maplewood parcel has been on the market since May 20, 2019, and we have only received the two offers. Therefore, I
recommend you approve the sale of this property to Sunny Properties 1 LLC.
By approving this sale, the Board also authorizes the Superintendent to effectuate the closing of the sale of the property and the transfer by
deed of title to the property.
