Clean Buildings
Performance
Standard
Compliant By 2026

Packet page 3 of 112

What is the Clean Buildings
Performance Standard and
how do we comply?
The Clean Buildings Performance Standard (CBPS) is a Washington
State law (HB1257) Being Implemented by the Washington State
Department Of Commerce Beginning June 1, 2026. This new law aims
to reduce energy consumption and emissions in commercial buildings.
•
•
•

June 1, 2026 – Buildings > 220,000 SF
June 1, 2027 – Buildings between 90,000 and 220,000 SF
June 1, 2028 – Buildings between 50,000 and 90,000 SF
(Actual reporting dates)

To comply with this law, building owners need to demonstrate the following:

1. An O&M program has been implemented in their building
2. An energy management plan has been completed
3. The building's weather normalized EUI is less than or equal to
the building's EUIt for a minimum of 12months before the
compliance dates listed below
Packet page 42of 112

Slide 27

What exactly is an EUI or EUIt and how are they applied?
EUI stands for Energy Use Intensity and is calculated by the size of a building (square footage), the
building type (how it is used), the energy consumed by that building, and the location of that building.
EUIt is the Energy Use Intensity Target that is mandated by the state based on an assessment from
similar buildings types and energy consumption goals.
Weather Normalized Site EUIt for K-12 Schools in Pierce County (Zone 4C) are as follows:

• 48 EUIt - Elementary
• 48 EUIt - Middle School
• 49 EUIt - High School
(Lower scores = More Efficient)

Packet page 5 of 112

How do we track Energy Use and Where are we currently?
Program: Energy Star Portfolio Manager

Metrics: Energy usage, emissions, cost, EUI

12% annual cost increase from
the utility provider

January 10, 2024
To:

Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

From: Shawn Lewis
Subject: Financial Update
Attached are the Budget Status Reports for all funds as of the end of December 2023, along
with charts and data showing our monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund
cash balance.
Enrollment for the year to date continues to be under projection - no significant change from
last month and consistent with expectations based on the beginning of the year enrollment.
Running Start enrollment remains well above projection. We should have a better idea on
second semester Running Start enrollment in February.
General Fund balance as of the end of December was $2,216,994 – which is about $1.4 million
better than last year at the same time. Our end of month cash balance is also roughly $1.4
million higher than last year.
The Capital Projects Fund budget now reflects the budget extension adopted by the board in
December. We have a $161,770 fund balance at the end of the month – with nearly all
additional revenue expected to be received in April, May and June. Expenses will follow shortly
thereafter.
The Debt Service fund has roughly $1.35 million in fund balance. There are no outstanding
general obligation bonds for the district with the final payment made in December 2023. We
expect to pay over $1.6 million toward our non-voted debt in June and have already started
discussions with our financial advisory regarding paying off all debt by the end of the calendar
year.
Overall cash flow remains fine at this point, with March continuing to be our projected lowpoint. December activity was better than expected – so cash balance projections are slightly
improved.

In November 2023, the voters approved the capital projects levy that will allow $6 million to be
collected in the 2024 calendar year. Roughly half of that amount will be collected in this fiscal
year. As part of the expenditure plan, we anticipate spending the entire $3 million collection
during this fiscal year.
The first $2.95 million is being allocated to the following projects: $1.35 million payment
toward the outstanding $4 million non-voted debt $800,000 to replace Cherrydale’s HVAC
$450,000 to replace district HVAC controls $200,000 for instructional technology systems

$150,000 for safety and security items. In addition to these items, one payment is left to be
made to the contractors for the Maintenance Facility. This amount was planned to be paid out
of last year’s budget and it is why our ending fund balance was higher than anticipated. Once
they complete all required tasks we will release that payment in this fiscal year. No levy funds
are being used for this project.
The budget extension has been reviewed by the ESD and the public hearing has been advertised
as required.

Special Education teacher.
"Some people are born to work in education and Ms. Taylor Lux is one of these people. In the
three years that Taylor has been a part of our Otter Space community, her dedication,
compassion, and resiliency have left a lasting impression not only on her students and families
but also on the staff at Saltar's Point. Taylor's commitment to her profession is truly
commendable. Taylor began her career in education three years ago and despite being newer to
the field of Special Education, she has displayed a level of dedication that goes beyond
expectations. Her passion for fostering a positive learning environment is evident in every
interaction with students, colleagues, and parents. It is hard to remember at times that she is
still relatively new to education as her skill-set surpasses what we would assume a new teacher
has in their toolbox. What sets Taylor apart is not just her dedication, but also their
overwhelming compassion. She approaches her work with a genuine concern for the well-being
and growth of each student. Taylor's ability to connect with others on a personal level has
created a nurturing and inclusive atmosphere within her classroom and also the greater school
community. In addition to her dedication and compassion, Taylor has shown remarkable
resilience in the face of managing unexpected student behaviors. The day-to-day demands of
working with students that experience unexpected behaviors can be challenging, but Taylor has
consistently demonstrated the ability to adapt and overcome obstacles providing a safe space
for her students and a sense of calm. Her resilience is something that all can learn from and
aspire to. Taylor's unwavering dedication and compassion to our Otter Community has and will
continue to have a positive impact on the lives of our students and anyone who is fortunate
enough to know and work alongside her. Ms. Lux, you are "otterly" valued and appreciated!"

Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1
Board of Directors’ Operating Protocol
Adopted January 17, 2024
The most effective way to operate and supervise a dynamic, growing school district is
through close cooperation between the school board, the superintendent, and the
administrative leadership team. Each group plays a different role, and each role is
essential to the success of the entire system (staff and students). In order to allow each
group to compliment and ensure the success of the others, there must be agreement on
some philosophical ideas and practical ways of working together to achieve the
common goal – quality education programs for each student. To achieve, within the
legal and financial limits of the District, quality education programs for each student, the
Board pledges to strive toward excellence in performance and expects the same from
each individual who works in Steilacoom Historical School District.
Board directors and administrators have an obligation to provide educational leadership.
The public expects the best in planning, decision-making, communication, and
educational expertise. However, all decisions and policies of the Board-Administration
Team must be gauged and tested against two fundamental beliefs: schools are for kids;
and schools belong to the people.
For the purpose of enhancing teamwork among members of the Board and between the
Board and the Administrative Team, we, the members of the Steilacoom School District
Board of Directors, do hereby publicly commit ourselves collectively and individually to
the following operating protocol:
PRINCIPLES FOR BOARD-ADMINISTRATION RELATIONS
The following philosophical ideas, operating principles, and behaviors, when adhered to
by all, will create an open, productive environment for a team approach to school
leadership:
1.

Positive Approach
Each member of the team is charged with the responsibility of working with the
team to find the best way to meet the needs of the students and staff. An open,
positive, and problem solving atmosphere toward designing, implementing, and
assessing plans to achieve the goals of the organization is critical.

2.

Judgment and Trust
To develop an effective team process, each group must support and cooperate
with team members, collectively and individually.

Page 1 of 4

Packet page 93 of 112

3.

Loyalty and Disagreement
Cooperation, support, and loyalty do not mean there will be agreement on every
issue. Dialogue, divergent thinking, and debate will encourage the best
decisions. To clarify this principle, a few ground rules must be covered:

4.

•

Each team member has the responsibility for being loyal to the District, to
each member of the team, and to the primary goal -- a quality education
for every child.

•

Board Directors should not be contacting employees of the District on
operational issues. Questions about operations, direction, etc., should be
directed to the Superintendent.

•

Board Directors are encouraged to offer praise for employees, but
criticism must be channeled through the Superintendent’s office.

•

Debate the issues, not one another. Avoid personal slurs and snide
comments.

•

Information about employees, negotiations, and other confidential areas
discussed in executive session will remain completely confidential.
Information given in confidence, particularly when planning and exploring
alternatives must also remain confidential. Team members should state in
advance whatever they consider to be confidential information.

•

When Board Directors or the superintendent find themselves in
disagreement with another team member, a one-to-one meeting with that
person should be arranged to resolve the disagreement. Once resolved,
the disagreement will remain a private matter.

•

Discussion at meetings and debate over issues should be open and
honest. Once a final team decision is reached, each member has the
responsibility to support the decision.

•

Agendas must be open and on the table for meaningful dialogue to occur.
Information upon which decisions are to be made, with accompanying
alternatives, will be given to the Board in a timely manner so that
appropriate input and analysis can take place prior to the time of the
decision. Surprises at meetings are counterproductive.

Accountability to Community
The School Board, Superintendent, and administrative team are accountable to
the public for the decisions made and for the quality of their work. Responsibility
to the community is demonstrated by listening to them and by using effective
systems of gathering information as assessment.

Page 2 of 4

Packet page 94 of 112

5.

Communication
Effective interpersonal communication requires a healthy communication climate
with high levels of trust and respect for individuals and for the mission of
providing a quality education for all students. To achieve this, messages must be
open, straightforward, and honest.
•

The Superintendent and the Board will make deliberate attempts to share
information and data with all team members. Team members shall utilize
the chain of command as outlined by District policy/procedures.

•

When an individual Board Director is contacted by a staff or community
member, each member has agreed to the following procedures:
a.
b.
c.

Hear out the individual’s concern.
Ask if the issue has been discussed with the person immediately
responsible.
Express concern about the issue and a desire to assist in
resolution, while reinforcing the need to resolve the issue at the
immediate local level. If unsuccessful, proceed to the next level(s)
of responsibility.

•

Only the Superintendent, his/her designee, or a Board-designated
representative may contact the District’s negotiator, should one be used,
on current negotiations. If a Board Director feels a need to talk to District
counsel or the negotiator, he or she is to contact the Superintendent who
will arrange for all meetings. The Board president may contact the
District’s legal counsel in reference to the Superintendent’s contract.

•

It is important to keep the Superintendent and other Board members
informed of unusual happenings as quickly as they occur.

•

The Superintendent is responsible for communicating official district
operational positions to the media. There will also be occasions when the
Board president communicates the official District position. Board
members may certainly state personal positions; as long as they make it
known they are not speaking for the Board or the District.

•

The Board will emphasize planning, policy making, and public relations
rather than becoming involved in the daily operations of the schools.

•

After reviewing the agenda, Board members agree to ask questions when
clarification is needed so that the Board meetings can proceed smoothly
and efficiently. Board members can also contact the Superintendent to
discuss issues prior to the meetings. Members may also request addition
of items to the agenda prior to its adoption.

Page 3 of 4

Packet page 95 of 112

•

Each Board member will become conversant with matters on which the
Board acts, reviewing all materials prior to meetings. They will attend
essential Board training and inform themselves about important issues
through individual readings.

•

All personnel complaints and criticisms received by the Board or its
individual members will be directed to the Superintendent.

•

Members agree to operate as a team and employ appropriate group
problem solving techniques. They agree to focus on issues rather than
personalities, to propose viable alternatives to problems, to disagree
constructively and communicate with each other in a respectful manner.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Policy 5409 – Unpaid Holidays for Reason of Faith or Conscience
Per Washington state law, each district employee may request up to two unpaid holidays
per calendar year for a reason of faith or conscience or an organized activity conducted
under the auspices of a religious denomination, church or religious organization. This new
policy codifies the process for making this request.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

I move approval of Policy 5409 – Unpaid Holidays for Reason or Conscience

Personnel

UNPAID HOLIDAYS FOR REASON OF FAITH
OR CONSCIENCE
Each district employee may request up to two unpaid holidays per calendar year for a reason of
faith or conscience or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious
denomination, church or religious organization. In compliance with state law, the
Superintendent or designee or the employee’s supervisor will grant the request(s) unless he or
she determines that the employee’s absence would impose an undue hardship on the district or
the employee is necessary to maintain public safety.
Employee Request Process
An employee seeking to take unpaid holidays for reasons of faith or conscience will submit a
written request to their supervisor a minimum of two weeks prior to the requested days off. The
request will include:
• Number of Day(s) or half day(s) that the employee is requesting off;
• A sufficient description of the reason for the time off so that the supervisor can determine
whether it involves a reason of faith or conscience or an organized activity conducted
under the auspices of a religious denomination, church or religious organization.
• If the request is made less than two weeks prior to the requested time off, the employee
should include the reason that it was not possible to make the request in a timely manner.
District Approval Process
Upon receipt of an employee request for unpaid holidays, the Superintendent or designee, or
employee’s supervisor, will determine whether:
1. The request was submitted on a timely basis or sufficient justification exists for it not
being timely submitted;
2. The employee has already exhausted his/her two unpaid holidays per calendar year as
provided by law;
3. The request for unpaid holidays is based on a reason of faith or conscience or an
organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church or
religious organization. (Note: The time requested need not conform to a specific holiday
or event).
4. The employee’s absence would impose an undue hardship on the district; or
5. The employee is necessary to maintain public safety.
Undue hardship is defined as action requiring significant difficulty or expense to the
district. The supervisor will determine whether a request for unpaid leave constitutes an undue
hardship for the district on a case-by-case basis, taking into account specific objective facts and
circumstances present at the time of each request.

Page 1 of 3

Packet page 98 of 112

Policy No. 5409
Personnel
In determining whether an employee’s request for unpaid leave would impose an undue hardship
on the district, the following factors will be considered:
1. The number, composition and structure of the staff employed by the district or in the
requesting employee’s program;
2. The financial resources of the district or the requesting employee’s program;
3. The number of employees requesting leave for each day subject to such a request;
4. The financial impact on the district or requesting employee’s program resulting from the
employee’s absence and whether that impact is greater than a de minimus cost to the
district or the requesting employee’s program;
5. Impact on the district, the requesting employee’s program or public safety;
6. Type of operations of the district or the requesting employee’s program;
7. Geographic location of the employee or geographic separation of the particular program
to the operations of the district;
8. Nature of the requesting employee’s work;
9. Deprivation of another employee’s job preference or other benefit guaranteed by a
collective bargaining agreement;
10. Any other impact on district operations or the requesting employee’s program due to the
employee’s absence.
The request may be denied for any of the following reasons:
1. The request was not based on a reason of faith or conscience or an organized activity
conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church or religious
organization. (Note: The requested time off need not conform to a specific holiday or
event).
2. The employee has already exhausted their two unpaid holidays per calendar year (Note:
Unpaid holidays are not cumulative from year to year);
3. The employee is necessary to maintain public safety;
4. Granting the request would impose an undue hardship, as defined above, on the district.
A written response will be provided to the employee within five (5) business days, if feasible,
approving or denying the request. If the request is denied, the response will state the reason(s)
therefor.
Approval of unpaid holiday time does not constitute approval for an employee to take
compensated or other types of leave in conjunction with that time. An employee must seek
separate approval for compensated and other types of personnel leave consistent with applicable
district policies and procedures.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
In December, the Governor proposed a supplemental budget for the 2023-25 biennium that begins
the state process for amending their budget – and setting school district funding parameters for the
2024-25 school year.
The presentation tonight is intended to provide the board with initial information regarding
enrollment, expenditure, and revenue projections for the 2024-25 school year, along with a broad
timeline for budget adoption.
In summary, we expect that some cost reduction steps will be necessary in the 2024-25 school year
in order to rebuild the cash balances in the General Fund, generally consistent with the four-year
outlook (F-195F) adopted by the board last summer.
The information provided in this meeting is preliminary and will likely be changed by legislative
action. The district should have final state budget impacts in March and April 2024.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
This presentation is informational only. No action is needed.
