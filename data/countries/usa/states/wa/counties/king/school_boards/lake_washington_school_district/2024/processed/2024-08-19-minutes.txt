  Motion by Eric Laliberte, second by Lisa Guthrie.

  2. Closure of the Futures School, Resolution No. 2384
The Board took formal action to approve the closure of the Futures School. At the May 20, 2024, Board Meeting, Superintendent Holmen provided a recommendation to the Board to take action to close the Futures School. A public hearing was also held at the May 20, 2024, Board Meeting. The Futures School was opened in 1999 to address credit deficiency and to increase engagement and social emotional well-being of students. While the Futures School provided a much-needed support for students, the school has experienced significant decline in enrollment and did not enroll students from outside of the Juanita High School boundary starting in 2014-15. No students have been enrolled in the school over the last two years. Additionally, the LWSD has credit recovery and social and behavioral health supports at all high schools which has reduced the need for a stand-alone and unique program.
  RESOLUTION: The Board of Directors adopts Resolution No. 2384, Closure of the Futures School, as recommended.
  Motion by Lisa Guthrie, second by Eric Laliberte.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
