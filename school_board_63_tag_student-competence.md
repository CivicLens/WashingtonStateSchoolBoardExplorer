The Blaine School District No. 503 held a Special Board Meeting on December 5, 2024, primarily focused on the executive session to review the performance of Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger. The executive session lasted until 9:30 p.m., during which the board discussed the superintendent's performance evaluation. Following the closed session, the board considered taking action on the superintendent's evaluation, which included a proposal to extend Dr. Granger's employment contract through June 30, 2028. However, the board voted to table this action item until the next regular meeting on December 10, 2024, due to concerns about attendance. All directors were present, and the meeting concluded with a unanimous vote to adjourn at 9:28 p.m.
