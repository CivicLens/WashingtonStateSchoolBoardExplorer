B. REPORT TO THE BOARD This section can be watched at 13:54 time stamp.
1. Address the Budget - Frances Guerrero, YEA President
President Guerrero presented on the impact of budget cuts, emphasizing short staffs by reading a
Special Education teacher emails. One from the perspective of a teacher on the responsibility of
feeding and caring for one student.
2. Garfield Elementary Site Visit - Steve Brownlow, Principal
Principal Brownlow shared stats from his school. He has been in education for 28 years and so
proud to be the principal of Garfield. There is a big push for PLT's in our district and the work is
pivotal on the success of our teachers. The "Attendance Man" comes into the classrooms for 2 to
3 days. Part of today’s school tour will include YAMA. Community outreach is a priority at
Garfield; recently, the school partnered with four local barbers to provide free haircuts to 80
students and collaborated with Roots to Wings at PNWU for additional support. Additionally,
Garfield hosts a monthly "Student of the Month" assembly, with the goal of recognizing every
student by the end of the year. Principal Brownlow also proudly announced that Garfield
recently received an SBA award and highlighted Garfield's role as one of the first schools in the
district to adopt a dual-language program, currently serving K-3 with one non-dual and three
dual-language classrooms per grade level.

Director Rice expressed appreciation for the integration of PLCs and PLTs across different
grades, recognizing the positive impact on student learning and teacher collaboration. Vice
President Villanueva congratulated Principal Brownlow on his efforts to improve student
attendance and requested additional data on student achievement in math and reading, which
Principal Brownlow agreed to provide at a later time. Director Navarro, Jr. commended Principal
Brownlow and his staff for their resilience and innovative approaches to overcoming challenges,
noting the positive attitude and progress at Garfield.
3. English/Spanish Language Arts - Jaime Lee, Executive Director of Teaching and Learning
Jaime Lee, Executive Director of Teaching and Learning, presented an update on
English/Spanish Language Arts using the attached presentation. She explained that student
progress is measured through the Early Screening of Literacy for K-5 students, with data
collection for dual language classrooms ending at 3rd grade. For grades 3-10, the Smarter
Balanced Assessment (SBA) is used, with results communicated by the state through proficiency
levels. While there are areas of celebration in the scores, there is still room for improvement.
To address growth, teacher teams were brought together to identify essential standards for each
grade level to ensure students achieve proficiency. These teacher teams are also engaging in PLT
meetings to focus on four guiding questions: what students need to know, how to assess their
learning, how to respond if they have not learned it, and how to challenge those who already
know it.
President Walker asked how PLT's relate to the process district-wide. Director Rice asked why
the dual language students are outscoring our English students. VP Villanueva commented on
slide three, Director Navarro Jr. commented on slide four.
4. Summer Program Highlights - Jewel Brumley, Executive Director of Teaching and Learning
Jewel Brumley, Executive Director of Teaching and Learning, presented data from Summer
School 2024. DIBELS assessments measured literacy skills from K-8, with growth seen in both
math and literacy for K-4 students. The program incorporated 21st Century STEM skills. The
GearUP program at Franklin Middle School had 45 seventh graders attend, and the virtual high
school program recovered 302 credits across three schools. YV Tech partnered with local
companies to offer additional credit options. Special Education summer services supported 15
elementary students.
President Walker inquired about Special Education enrollment, which Jewel confirmed was
solely elementary students. She attributed low participation to families prioritizing other summer
activities. Jake Kuper explained that funding is categorical and efforts are ongoing to boost
participation.
Director Beckett asked about student selection criteria; Jaime clarified that high school focuses
on credit retrieval, while the LAP program targets 3rd graders based on assessment scores.
Migrant students are also included.
Director Rice requested growth data for Special Education and Migrant students, which Jewel
will provide. VP Villanueva raised concerns about the financial strain of summer school,
especially transportation costs. Jake noted the need to reassess costs for next year.

Regarding GearUP, not all schools participated in the summer, but all will be included in the
upcoming year under a new six-year grant. Director Navarro, Jr. inquired about the program’s
impact on closing achievement gaps, suggesting further discussion with Supt Greene.
C. UPDATES This section can be watched at 1:25:00 time stamp.
1. Members of the Board
Director Rice reported that she forwarded the email titled "Your Submission of Priority
Positions" and volunteered to update Policy 1400, which addresses board meetings. She will
collaborate with Bob Noe on this effort.
President Walker reminded board members to check their emails for the WSSDA voting ballot,
noting that two YSD members are on the ballot. He emphasized that the email from WSSDA
contains a unique link to each member's ballot.
2. Superintendent's Update
Supt Greene highlighted recent achievements at Garfield Elementary, including significant
growth in math proficiency and improved attendance rates, which Principal Brownlow had
previously shared. He also provided an update on ongoing training efforts, noting that
instructional facilitators and principals participated in a professional learning session focused on
enhancing collaboration and consistency across classrooms. The goal is to eliminate the
"educational lottery," ensuring all students receive a high-quality education regardless of their
assigned classroom.
Supt Greene emphasized that by fostering collaboration through PLCs, educators can break
down the isolation often felt in the classroom, leading to better student outcomes. He announced
an upcoming evening session on PLCs scheduled for next week.
Supt Greene recognized YSD school board member Graciela Villanueva for being featured in an
article celebrating her role at the Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic and her dedication to
breaking down barriers. He commended her contributions both to the community and the district.

2. 1000.1.0 Global Ends Statement – Goal #4, Dr. Maria Lucero, Exec Director of Teaching and
Learning.
Dr. Maria Lucero, Executive Director of Teaching and Learning, presented the Global Ends
Statement Report for Goal #4, which focuses on ensuring all students graduate bilingual and
biliterate. This goal aims to prepare students to be culturally competent, academically successful,
and ready for the global job market in two or more languages. The progress is measured through
dual language program implementation, world language course enrollment, and the Seal of
Biliteracy attainment.

Currently, 71% of K-5 schools have access to a two-way dual language program, with plans to
expand this by 2026. The district is on track to meet its dual language program goal one year
early, by fall 2025. Although enrollment in world languages is increasing slightly, disparities
remain among student subgroups, particularly for English Learners.
Dr. Lucero highlighted that students in dual language programs outperform their multilingual
peers in non-dual language settings. The district also saw an increase in students earning the Seal
of Biliteracy, with notable progress among Hispanic, Asian, and migrant students.
Board members expressed appreciation for the growth in dual language programs and Seal of
Biliteracy achievements. They requested additional data on students earning the Seal of
Biliteracy in languages other than Spanish, including American Sign Language, which Dr.
Lucero will provide in a future update.

of Finance
Jake Kuper, Assistant Supt of Finance, provided an update on district enrollment trends. He
highlighted that enrollment data has been closely monitored, especially in light of recent budget
reductions and ongoing Facilities Assessment Community Team (FACT Committee) discussions
related to facilities and capital improvements. YSD is experiencing a decade-long decline in
student numbers, particularly at the elementary level, with an overall reduction of 1,250 students
(a 16.4% decrease) since the 2015-2016 school year.
Middle school enrollment has remained relatively stable, while high school numbers have
decreased by about 7.2%. Alternative Learning programs have seen significant growth, with a
130% increase since 2015-2016. Jake emphasized that declining enrollment will continue to
impact staffing and finances and will be a key focus in future budget planning.
Jake confirmed that recent changes to allow more out-of-district students have resulted in some
new enrollments, with final numbers to be shared once the fiscal year is closed. The board will
receive a deeper analysis of enrollment trends during upcoming budget discussions in early
winter.
