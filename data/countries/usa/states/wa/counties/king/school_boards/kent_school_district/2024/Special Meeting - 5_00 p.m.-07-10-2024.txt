AGENDA ITEM:

Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Public Hearing (1 of 2) for the 2024-2025 District Budget
AGENDA ITEM:
In compliance with the state law, it is necessary for the board of directors to conduct public hearings on
the 2024-2025 Budget and to formally adopt maximum expenditure limits for all funds no later than
August 31, 2024. The law requires one hearing. However, to foster greater transparency and provide
more opportunity for stakeholder engagement, the district has scheduled two hearings this year. In
addition to this hearing, the second is scheduled for August 21, 2024, commensurate with the Budget
Adoption Calendar.
This meeting is the culmination of a budget development process that started in early spring and included
three separate budget work sessions. At the Budget Development Work Session on June 26th, an
overview of the budget proposal was provided, and a 2nd review will be provided prior to this public
hearing on July 10th. At the Board of Directors Regular Meeting on August 21, 2024, the proposed
budget will be presented for board review and adoption. Note that the budget proposal may undergo
changes during the technical review conducted by the Puget Sound Educational Service District (ESD
121) during the months of July and August, prior to adoption by the Board.

BOARD GOALS:
The 2024-2025 Budget supports all four district goals:
Goal 1: Preparing Students to be Global Citizens
Goal 2: Expanding Student, Family, and Community Partnerships
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
Goal 4: Investing in a Diverse Workforce and Inclusive Workplace Cultures
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
A resolution to approve the 2024-2025 Budget will be considered by the board of directors on August 21,
2024. The resolution will establish expenditure limits for the General Fund, Debt Service Fund, Capital
Projects Fund, Associated Student Body Fund, and Transportation Vehicle Fund as shown in the F-195.
The resolution will also adopt four-year budget forecasts for each fund (F-195F). Budget summary and
overview materials will be included as part of the board agenda materials and will be posted on the
districts website for public review.

2024 Capital Projects and Technology Replacement Levy
Public Hearing

AGENDA ITEMS:
The Board of Directors is conducting a public hearing on the November 2024 Capital Projects and
Technology Replacement Levy. Public notices were published on June 28, 2024, and July 5, 2024,
announcing that the Board of Directors of Kent School District No. 415, King County, Washington,
would meet in a public meeting on July 10, 2024, for the purpose of holding a public hearing regarding
theNovember 2024 Capital Projects and Technology Replacement Levy.The authorizing resolution
and associated materials are included in tonights board agenda for review and approval.
At this meeting, the board is considering the adoption of Resolution No. 1680 which would have the
effect of authorizing the filing of a ballot measure to King County prior to the August 6, 2024, deadline.
If authorized, the measure would subsequently go before the voters on the November 5, 2024, ballot.
Due to the districts increasing capital needs, its expiring capital/technology levy, and the current
structure of its debt service obligations (which included an interval drop in the districts tax rate
beginning in calendar year 2024), the district has sought approval for a new capital funding measure
approved in April 2023, November 2023, and April 2024. All these measures were unsuccessful.
In April 2023, the districts $495.0 million bond measure secured a yes vote percentage of 48.02%.
Subsequently, $190.2 million capital levy measures in November 2023 (48.87%) and $190.2 million in

April 2024 (43.3%).The district has an opportunity in November 2024 to run a Capital Projects and
Technology Replacement Levy to secure capital funding for the district.
The April 2024 ballot measure for $190.2 million was scheduled to be collected as follows:

The proposed November 2024 ballot measure for Capital Projects and Technology Replacement Levy
(November 2024 Ballot Measure) would be $97.8 million, which is nearly half of the April 2024 ballot
and is scheduled to be collected as follows:

The November 2024 Ballot Measure will be earmarked primarily to address the most pressing capital
project needs of the district that are mission critical in nature.
The Board has received information on the November 2024 Ballot Measure and the associated project
areas for both capital and technology, which include deferred maintenance and capital improvement
and repairs, technology infrastructure, devices, equipment software, subscriptions, training,
administrative, operational and staffing costs related to the implementation of the foregoing purposes.
The Board also received information surrounding the projected impacts to the overall taxing authority
of the school district.
The table below shows the important timelines published by King County:

BOARD GOALS:
Goal 1: Preparing Students to be Global Citizens
Goal 2: Expanding Student, Family, and Community Partnerships
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
Goal 4: Investing in a Diverse Workforce and Inclusive Workplace Cultures

BUDGET IMPLICATION:
If approved, this proposition would authorize the district to levy the following excess taxes on all taxable
property within the district, to provide funding for capital projects for student safety, security, instruction,
classroom and support services, and technology needs.

Resolution No. 1680

2024 Capital Projects and Technology Replacement Levy

AGENDA ITEMS:
Since April of 2023, the district has sought approval for a new capital funding measure approved, in
view of its increasing capital needs, its expiring capital/technology levy, and the current structure of its
debt service obligations, which included an interval drop in the districts tax rate beginning in calendar
year 2024.
So far these efforts have been unsuccessful. In April 2023, the districts $495 million bond measure
failed to pass, securing a yes vote percentage of 48.02 percent. Subsequently, smaller capital levy
measures in November 2023 (48.87%) and April 2024 (43.3%) also did not pass.
The district has an opportunity in November 2024 to re-run a Capital Projects and Technology
Replacement Levy to secure capital funding for the district. The district is dedicating considerable time
and resources to understanding the sentiment of the voters and the reasons for the levy failures. One
important consideration is that historically, voter turnout is more robust during presidential elections,
and the district has a history of success with capital measures on presidential election ballots (the last
successful district bond measure was November of 2016).
Previously, the districts request was for $60,900,000 in 2024 for collection in 2025, $63,400,000 in
2025 for collection in 2026, and $65,900,000 in 2026 for collection in 2027. The new ballot measure
would be less than half that original amount. The new measure would include only critical projects and
needs, and would include $32,200,000 in 2024 for collection in 2025, $32,600,000 in 2025 for
collection in 2026, and $33,000,000 in 2026 for collection in 2027. The total request of $97.8 million
over three years is approximately $92.4 million less than the total request put to the voters in April of
2024. This new Capital Projects and Technology Replacement Levy measure is focused exclusively
on addressing the districts most pressing needs regarding its capital program.
The Board has received briefing materials on the proposed ballot measure and the associated project
areas for both capital and technology, as well as the projected impacts to the overall taxing authority
of the school district.
The Capital Projects and Technology Replacement Levy provides funding for district facility and
educational needs, including deferred maintenance and capital improvement and repairs, as well as
technology infrastructure, devices, equipment software, subscriptions, training, administrative,
operational and staffing costs related to the implementation of the foregoing purposes.
The important timelines associated with filing, as published by King County, can be reviewed here:

budget implications with this endorsement resolution.

Pro/Con Committee Appointment
for
Resolution No. 1680
2024 Capital Projects and Technology Levy

AGENDA ITEMS:
In the event the board adopts Resolution No. 1680, the law contemplates appointment of two committees
in connection therewith, in this case not later than August 6, 2024. One committee should be comprised
of individuals known by the Board of Directors to be in favor of the measure, and the other made up of
those known by the board to oppose such a measure. Those committees are then required to submit
statements to elections officials to be published in the voters pamphlet.
Pro and con committees consist of members of the public who commit to write a statement either in favor
of or in opposition to a ballot measure for publication in the voters pamphlet. Each committee is limited to
three members. The school district does not facilitate or oversee the work of these Committees; rather,
they submit their work directly to the County.
In the alternative, the board may refrain from appointing individuals to either or both committees, in which
case the County Auditor may choose to make such appointments, if possible.

If the Board of Directors decides to appoint members to the committees, it is recommended the
appointment process follow the roll-call vote nomination process typically used for the annual
appointment of director offices.

Extension Letters of School Safety Services Liaison Agreement and School Resource Officer
Agreement
Between the Kent Police Department and the Kent School District for the 2024-2025 School Year

AGENDA ITEM:
Kent School District regards the safety of its students and staff as a top priority. The district is seeking to
contract with the Kent Police Department for School Safety Service Liaison and School Resource
Officers. As per Law 28A. 320.1242 (1)(a) If a law enforcement agency or security guard company
supplies safety and security staff to work on school property when students are expected to be present,
the school district must annually review and adopt an agreement with the law enforcement agency or
security guard company that meets the requirements of this section.
By agreeing to these extensions, the Kent School District endeavors to continue partnerships with our
local law enforcement agency to provide:
One (1) Kent Police Commander in the form of a School Safety Services Liaison. The Kent
School District shares the total cost of the commander with the Kent Police Department. The
total cost of the Liaison for the 2024-2025 school year is $277,380. The Kent School District is
responsible for 25% of the total cost which equals $69,345.
Two (2) Kent Police School Resource Officers. The primary areas of service are Kent-Meridian
High School, Mill Creek Middle School, Canyon Ridge Middle School, iGrad, Kentridge High
School, Meridian Middle School, and Kent Laboratory Academy. The Kent School District shares

the total cost of the School Resource Officers with the Kent Police Department. The total cost of
the School Resource Officers for the 2024-2025 school year is $363,200.70. The Kent School
District is responsible for 60% of the total cost which equals $217,920.42.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 3: Building equitable systems and school environments

BUDGET IMPLICATION:
For the 2024-2025 school year, the cost to the Kent School District for one (1) School Safety Liaison is
$69,345 paid out of the 2024-2025 Safety Services Budget. This is an increase of $5,005.50 from the
2024-2025 school year due to annual salary increases.
For the 2024-2025 school year, the cost to the Kent School District for two (2) School Resource Officers
is $217,920.42 paid out of the 2024-2025 Safety Services Budget. This is an increase of $12,178.85 from
the 2023-2024 school year due to annual salary increases.
For the 2024-2025 school year, the total cost to the Kent School District for both extensions are
$287,265.07 paid out of the 2024-2025 Safety Services Budget. This is an overall increase of $17,184.35
from the 2023-2024 school year.

2023-2024 Capital Facilities Plan

Post King County Technical Review

AGENDA ITEM:
In order to continue the collection of impact fees, county and city ordinances require an annual update
and adoption of the Districts Capital Facilities Plan for the ensuing six years. Key features of the Plan for
each year include enrollment history and forecast, school facility use, and standard of service plans to
address facility needs, and calculation of fees for new single family and multi-family housing.

Upon adoption of the Comprehensive Plan, the impact fees will not be collected in 2024 due to a
reduction in enrollment and our 2023 detailed Capacity Study.

During our King County Technical Review, the County Auditors agreed that our choice to suspend for this
year was in line with what most other districts showing data somewhat close to ours had chosen to do.
Our Final Plan was sent with these changes back to King County on May 9, 2024.

The required SEPA documents and public notices have been filed with the 14-day comment period in
accordance with the State Environmental Policy Act. The Capital Facilities Plan effective date is July 17,
2024.

BOARD GOALS:
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments

BUDGET IMPLICATION:
Adoption of the Capital Facilities Plan is required for collection of School Impact Fees. The fees for single
family residences will be $0.00 and for multi-family they will be $0.00.

RECOMMENDATION:
The recommendation is for the Board of Directors to approve the 2023-2024 Capital Facilities Plan as
presented.
