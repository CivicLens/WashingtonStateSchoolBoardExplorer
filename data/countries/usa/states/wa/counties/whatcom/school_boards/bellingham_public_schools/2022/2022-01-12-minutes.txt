OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
January 12, 2022 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Bashaw called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. She acknowledged that this meeting,
while attended from various locations, is being held on the ancestral homelands of the
Coast Salish people. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw (President), Douglas Benjamin,
Camille Diaz Hackler, Jenn Mason, Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri
O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
Ms. Bashaw noted that, because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19,
public participation is limited to written submissions only, and all written comments
received will be shared with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all
messages received.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
January is school board recognition month, and Dr. Baker and the entire district
appreciate the service that the members of the board provide to students and staff. In
addition, WSSDA recently recognized Ms. Diaz Hackler for her 10 years of service on
the school board.
Promise K had a successful start last week with the largest cohort yet, over 160 students
at nine schools.
The Alderwood preschool and Parkview playgrounds recently opened and Sunnyland
construction is progressing. The new playgrounds are more accessible for all children,
including those who have mobility challenges. The bond includes funds for new inclusive
playgrounds at several elementary schools.
Last week’s weather, including snow and cold temperatures, presented challenges to our
school schedule. Dr. Baker is appreciative of staff who helped to keep students safe
during that time. We recognized on social media the BPS transportation and
custodial/maintenance staff who work hard to prepare our sites, monitor roads and
navigate bus routes.
Dr. Baker noted that the COVID-19 case rates in the community have risen, and the peak
will likely be reached in the next few weeks. Staffing has been and continues to be a
challenge. We are working to recruit retirees, parents, etc. as substitutes. The governor,
state superintendent and health departments do not expect to shut down the entire state or

all schools. We will continue to follow guidelines and requirements from the CDC and
state health department. Dr. Baker responded to questions from board members.
The bond measure will go to voters on Feb. 8, and ballots will arrive in mailboxes in the
next week or two. Information will continue to be shared with the community. Dr. Baker
responded to questions from board members.
The state legislature returned on Monday. The state’s economy has rebounded well, and
massive cuts are not expected. Over the next few weeks, the state budget picture will
begin to be clearer. There is strong advocacy for K-12, including fully funding special
education; enrollment stabilization due to reduction in enrollment since the pandemic;
increased funding for social emotional support, including nursing staff and mental health
counselors. Dr. Baker responded to questions from board members.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
Dr. Baker's reports to the board at meetings, and even informal lunch meetings with
individual board members are always thoughtful, thorough and well prepared. This is an area that
the Superintendent does particularly well. The Board is always kept well-informed and given the
opportunity to ask questions and get timely responses. Of the many talents our Superintendent
brings to the district, his communications with the board (and community) ranks high on the list.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
No areas identified.
4. Comments on the report itself.
Going forward, work that is underway to increase both student voice and parent voice to the
board could be additional evidence of compliance under 2.c.iii..

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• Continuing to secure more grants. The 21/22 school year 1.6MM was already secured in the
first few months compared to all of 20/21.
• The ongoing partnerships with community agencies to support students and their families.
• BPS continues to be at the table for the ongoing discussions on how to provide quality and
affordable childcare.
• First annual Back-To-School Family Block Party.
• Increased services due to COVID-19 such as mental health and nursing and invested in our
special education program.
DB:
• There is solid evidence that the superintendent and his team have forged many strong ongoing community partners which enhance both the district’s goals and helps meet community
needs. District grantsmanship continues to be strong and grow.
• The “Back-To-School Family Block Party” is simply genius. It will be exciting to see it
become a continuing tradition.
• Bonds and Levies passing by margins in the 70% range is good evidence of an informed
community and their clear support.
• The budget process and its alignment with Board Ends Policies is evident, as is the extensive
effort to communicate with stakeholders throughout.
• No external audit findings in the past 16 years. This speaks for itself.

CDH:
• The board is impressed with increased involvement with community partnerships. It adds to
better outcomes for more students, which is so needed during these times.
• The back to school party was a novel approach to meeting the needs of many.
JM:
• Excellent work in applying for and receiving grants to serve families with some of the highest
needs and to respond to challenges brought by the pandemic.
• Appreciate the highlight of our GRADS students graduating and the community relationships
that help support the program.
• The pandemic impacted the budgeting planning and execution process in so many ways and
this report really demonstrates how knowledgeable, flexible, and forward-thinking staff had to
be to take advantage of funding opportunities and work around changes coming from the
federal, state, and local levels.
• The work to retain staff and add new staff/programs related to the pandemic were/are a huge
part of weathering this ongoing crisis.
KR:
● Appreciate that in addition to grants specific to education, funding is being secured for factors
critical for learning to occur--food, family resource centers, vaccine outreach, education, etc.
These areas also help illustrate how big of an impact public schools have on the communities
that comprise them.
● High rates of support for levies and bonds further demonstrates how essential schools are to
the community and how much our community is invested in BSD *and* the trust our
constituents have in BSD leadership to steward this huge public asset.
● The careful thoughtfulness and intention in each part of the budget process is always
impressive, but to maintain it over a time of such uncertainty is something of a wonder to
behold.
● Love, love, love the Back-to-School block party event and hope it continues. Would love to
see it continue as an effort to welcome all students and families to school and focus on
helping all students and families access programs and services--a multitude of barriers impede
participation and hamper families in back-to-school preparation.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KB:
• None.
DB:
• None.
CDH:
• A suggestion would be to grow the back to school party to make it appealing for more
families.
JM:
• None.
4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Impressive evidence to support that BPS is in compliance with EL-7.

• New Director of Facilities and Sustainability.
• Seeking funding for an energy/carbon audit.
• Over 200 preventive maintenance measures were completed during the 2020-21 school year.
• Sehome High School is now an APP facility.
DB:
• There continues to be evidence of aggressive and effective planning with respect to new and
upgraded facilities. The pace is fast and steadily achieved over years of work. It is obvious
that voters strongly support these efforts.
• It is obvious how the pandemic adversely impacted many facilities processes. The evidence
shows strong management and mitigation of these influences.
• Sharpening the focus on sustainability is forward thinking and impressive, e.g. title changes.
• Efficiency gains by increased vehicle repair and maintenance capabilities are noted.
CDH:
• The board is impressed with the work done towards healthy and sustainable school
environments.
• Great work on cleaning out all of those storage containers.

Navigation of logistical and staffing challenges due to the pandemic, including difficulty
hiring for certain positions, furniture surplus, and supply chain issues.
Appreciate the additional focus on sustainability, including the newly adapted position and
new initiatives that have an environmental focus.
More building becoming part of the APP Program.
Excellent progress on so many capital projects, even in the face of supply chain issues,
COVID requirements, staff challenges, etc. That long list of project updates is a testament to
both the management of these projects and how hard staff work at every level to complete
them.
Solar-ready roofs at some of our newer schools.
This report really demonstrates all of the efforts around energy conservation, waste reduction,
and sustainable practices. Proud that this District is putting in so much attention to these areas.

KR:
● Recognizing sustainability as a department and hiring new director of facilities and
sustainability.
● Team was able to complete over 200 maintenance projects over the 2019-2020 school year
while also supporting the community through the Lighthouse Mission.
● Remarkable efforts to adapt and plan for sustainability, safety and health despite uncertainty
and staffing challenges
○ completion of measures to aid school lockdowns
○ delivery of food and supplies during remote learning
○ solar panel ready roofing
○ improving air quality and filtration
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KB:
• None.
DB:
• Are there answers to the skilled staffing shortage? Money? Conditions?
CDH:
• None.
JM:
• None.
4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Very much appreciated all of the data to support that the Superintendent and BPS is in
compliance.
DB:
• As in other reports, very helpful to have new issues/information highlighted.
CDH:
• The level of details are great.
JM:
• None.

Appreciate the detailed explanation of how energy efficiency can be measured as well as the
barriers to getting meaningful data this year. Looking forward to a full data set and the impact
the team's commendable efforts will have.
While not directly related to the commendable work that happened over 2019-2020 I continue
to be troubled by some of the language in the section detailing Loss Experience Factor,
especially as staff accidents continue to increase. Would appreciate evidence that the increase
is “due, at least in part, to non-work-related physical activities, recreational activities, as
well as emotional and mental health issues.” And that L&I turnaround time results in “
some employees to become comfortable with time loss payments and not working.”
While this may simply be poor wording, including “emotional and mental health” in this
sentence seems to imply emotional and mental health issues should not be considered workrelated. Without evidence to support them or further explanation, these assertions do not
appear aligned with BSD’s belief in compassion or values of equity and inclusion.

5. Possible changes to the policy.
KB:
• None.
DB:
• Does the board want to consider adding further language to EL-9 which calls out an emphasis
on sustainability, energy efficiency/alternatives and being mindful of climate change/impacts?
Clearly the work is being done.
CDH:
• None.
JM:
• None.
KR:
• Is it worth exploring adding language about sustainability and health? There's a clear drive
towards sustainability from the team, and the pandemic has really highlighted just how huge
an impact buildings and facilities can have on student health.
