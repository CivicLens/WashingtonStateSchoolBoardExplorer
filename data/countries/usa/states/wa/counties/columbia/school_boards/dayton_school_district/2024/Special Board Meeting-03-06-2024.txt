Public Content
Per RCW 42.30.110 the Board will hold an executive session to discuss the qualifications of an
applicant for public employment.
Board of Education Policy 1410 addresses the convening of an Executive Session.
EXECUTIVE OR CLOSED SESSIONS
Before convening in executive session, the chairperson shall publicly announce the general purpose for
excluding the public from the meeting place and the time when the executive session will be concluded.
The executive session may be extended to a stated later time by announcement of the chairperson.
An executive session may be conducted for one or more of the following purposes:
A. To consider the selection of a site or the acquisition of real estate by lease or purchase when public
knowledge regarding such consideration would cause a likelihood of increased price;
B. To consider the minimum price at which real estate will be offered for sale or lease when public
knowledge regarding such consideration would cause a likelihood of decreased price; however, the final
action of selling or leasing public property shall be taken in a meeting open to the public;

C. To review negotiations on the performance of publicly-bid contracts when public knowledge regarding
such consideration would cause a likelihood of increased costs;
D. To receive and evaluate complaints or charges brought against a director or staff member; however,
upon the request of such director or staff member, a public hearing or a meeting open to the public shall
be conducted on such complaint or charge;
E. To evaluate the qualifications of an applicant for public employment or to review the performance of a
staff member; however, discussion of salaries, wages, and other conditions of employment to be
generally applied within the district shall occur in a meeting open to the public, and when the board of
directors elects to take the final action of hiring, setting the salary of an individual staff member or class of
staff members, or discharging or disciplining an employee, that action shall be taken in a meeting open to
the public;
F. To evaluate the qualifications of a candidate for appointment to the board of directors; however, any
interview of such candidate and final action appointing a candidate to the board of directors shall be in a
meeting open to the public; or
G. To discuss with legal counsel representing the district matters relating to district enforcement actions,
or litigation or potential litigation to which the district, the board of directors, or a member acting in an
official capacity is, or is likely to become, a party, when public knowledge regarding the discussion is
likely to result in an adverse legal or financial consequence to the district. Potential litigation means
matters protected by attorney-client privilege related to litigation that has been specifically threatened;
litigation that the district reasonably believes may be commenced; or the litigation or legal risks of a
proposed action or current practice of the district, if public discussion is likely to result in an adverse or
financial consequence to the district.
