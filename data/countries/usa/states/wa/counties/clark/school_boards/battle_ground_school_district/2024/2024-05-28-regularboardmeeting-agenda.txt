Presenter:
Allison Tuchardt, Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment
Background:
The District Art Show has been an ongoing tradition since 1959. It was started by Art Teacher Bob Peck, in collaboration with
Battle Ground city librarian Frances Rieck, as a way to share their students artistic talents with the community because there
was no event such as a basketball tournament to show off their students skills. It has morphed and grown over the years and is
still a favorite event for students, parents, teachers, and community members alike.
This year's art show is presented virtually on the district website for students, families, board members, and the community to
view online. First place and special awards will be presented in person at the Board meeting and other awards will be presented
at the students schools.Citizens can choose their favorite student artwork from the primary, middle, and high school grade levels
for the Peoples Choice Award.
We encourage all families of Battle Ground Public Schools to view the show and celebrate the creative voice of our students.
Aheartfelt thanks go out to all the district's teachers for inspiring and supporting the arts.Enjoy the show!

and information on the group of students traveling with chaperones.
Exceptions to the rule are travel requests for state and national tournaments and competitions. The procedures for these types of

approval. The trip is then ratified by board members at their next regularly scheduled board meeting.
Student travel requests are attached.

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

The Board approve the district's Highly Capable Plan
to be submitted to OSPI.

Public Content
Lynnell Tsugawa-Murray, Director of Federal Programs will be present at the meeting in casethe board
has questions.
Background:
The state-funded Highly Capable Program grant of approximately $374,037.09 provides funding to support the identified highly
capable (HC) students in our district. Funding goes toward a full-time program coordinator to support the services for HC
students along with secretarial support, assessment and instructional materials, professional development, and collaboration
time for teachers.
Battle Ground Public Schools has 142 students in the magnet program and 692 students in the cluster program equalling a
grand total of 915 students identified as highly capable for the 2022- 23 school year. This continues to be seven percent (7%) of
the districts total enrollment in grades K-12. Washington State guidelines (WAC 392-170-040) are followed for the determination
of highly capable students. Students are identified through an assessment process using multiple criteria including measures for
cognitive ability, academic achievement, and evidence of creative thinking. Learning options for HC students in grades K-12
include advanced grade and/or subject placement, the Aspire cluster and magnet program, honors courses, AP courses, and
Running Start.
Highly capable students need a faster pace and greater depth and complexity as well as interaction with their intellectual peers.
With this in mind, the goals of the HC program are:
To identify and support students who have high academic and creative thinking abilities;
To provide differentiated instruction appropriate to the needs of HC learners;
To place students among their intellectual peer groups; and
To provide appropriate professional development opportunities to maximize teaching effectiveness in providing for the
academic and social-emotional needs of HC learners.
The teachers use the district-adopted curriculum based on the state standards and emphasize the critical and creative thinking
processes. The district coordinator works with teachers to support student learning and provides professional development on
differentiating instruction and how to meet the unique needs of students.
The highly capable grant is submitted to OSPI each year describing how the funds were used and the services provided to highly
capable students.
2023-2024 Expenditures Included

Part-time program secretary
10% of HC Magnet Teachers

Action

Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors approve Energy Services
Authorization No. 2024-909 A (1) and the Funding
Approval letter.

Public Content
Presenter:
Kevin Jolma, Executive Director of Facilities and Operations
Background:
These documents are based on the Investment Grade Audit Fee Proposal from Ameresco dated February 2, 2024- to audit
energy usage at District facilities. On March 28, 2022, the Board approved an Interagency
Agreement (IA) with
Washington State Department of Enterprise Services (DES). This IA allows BGPS to contract directly with the DES to utilize
Services and Contractors approved by the State to assist in energy savings programs.
In May of 2019, the WA Clean Building Act (HB 1257, 2019) was signed into law. Part of this law requires the development and
implementation of the Clean Buildings Standard (CBS) (WAC 194-50).
The objective of the CBS is to reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency and performance in existing
commercial or public buildings.

The first step to comply with the CBS is to identify the Energy Use Intensity (EUI) score per building and confirm the EUI is below
the expected EUI target provided by the State. The District is required to populate
ENERGYSTAR portfolio manager
with buildings and EUI scores to be used as the reporting tool to the State. A portion of this proposal is to establish the baseline
of our building energy efficiency. This portion of the work will cost $49,816.
During the next six months, Ameresco will identify the path toward compliance per building and create an Energy Management
Plan for our buildings that will guide the implementation of energy savings measures over the
next several years.
Thereare three phases of compliance dates of the CBS based on building size. Our only building included in Phase 1 is BGHS.
This portion of work at BGHS is $42,404.
In addition, as outlined in our Capital Levy we will be replacing all or most of the fluorescent lighting in our buildings and
upgrading to LED lighting. LED is far superior in energy use as well as aesthetics. Fluorescent
lights and Natural Gas are
being phased out in the State of Washington. This portion of the work will cost $65,559.
Lastly, we will be bundling many of our projects from the recently approved Capital Levy into this potentially larger ESCO project
with Ameresco. That will be outlined at a later date.
