The school board discussed potential budget cuts due to the possible failure of a local levy (EP&O).  Ms. Porter, a district representative, explained that if the levy fails, programs that can be reduced would face 24% cuts. The discussion focused on the impact of these reductions, particularly on staffing. There was concern expressed about the number of staff potentially impacted by a $2.7M reduction and the legal requirements for notifying staff about potential job losses.  The process for developing a reduced education plan was reviewed, highlighting the complexities and uncertainties involved. The board also discussed the district's efforts to address reductions in school library staffing and why volunteers could not replace contracted employees.

## 2020-02-24 - BLAINE_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Blaine School District No. 503 board held a work session on February 24, 2020, facilitated by Rich Parker from McPherson & Jacobson to establish performance objectives for the new superintendent.  The meeting focused on board governance best practices, including establishing clear goals aligned with WSSDA's School Board Standards, encouraging public engagement through structured meetings and forums, and fostering positive interpersonal relationships. Discussions also revolved around clarifying the role of the public during regular meetings, emphasizing the importance of avoiding "rubber-stamping" decisions, and promoting a culture of trust and accountability.  

The board discussed potential policy changes, including updating district policies to include a WIAA Point of Contact position and establishing a new Policy Representative role for overseeing policy development. They also reviewed superintendent evaluation protocols, favoring performance-based evaluations over standards-based ones. Concerns were raised regarding the special education budget being significantly overallocated for several years. The board recommended a special review of this program to gain a better understanding of its dynamics and address the funding deficit from the state.
