Staff submitted the attached resolution 4-20. As
superintendent, I have reviewed this resolution and fully
support board adoption.

Public Content
The recent school closuresresulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, and the request by the Superintendent of Public Instruction to continue
providing student meals to those who need them, has resulted in a need to acquire new and different products. The district has experienced
challenges with acquiring products from regular vendors. Federal law requires that the district obtain three informal quotes for purchases
over $10,000 and undertake competitive bidding for purchases greater than $75,000. These requirements require a lengthy timeline of at
least 30 days prior to awarding a contract.
The board may declare an emergency and waive the competitive bidding or allow noncompetitive proposals. In accordance with Board
Policy 1320, the board may waive the requirements of State Law RCW 28A.335.190 requiring advertising and competitive bidding
procedures and the related local policies, due to the need to serve the public interest and ensure a sufficient supply of nutritious meals to
those who need them. Additionally, the board may allow procurement by noncompetitive proposals under Federal Law 2 C.F.R. ยง 200.320(f)
(2) due to the emergent need to provide nutritious meals.
We are requesting the board adopt resolution 4-20, which will allow the district to procure food product from a variety of vendors during the
period of school closures.

Public Content
We are facing unprecedented times in education as a result of the Covid-19 Pandemic. Closing our schools and moving to remote learning
has forced us to see our work with students differently and is resulting in accommodations and adaptations that are necessary for our
students to be successful in this new environment. Perhaps the group of students impacted the most are our high school seniors. Not only
have some of their major events and milestones been disrupted but, for many, their ability to graduate on time has possibly also been
jeopardized unless certain issues are addressed.
One of the key factors we must address in our efforts to help our seniors graduate on time is regarding the credits required to finish their
coursework and ultimately receive their diploma. The state has been very clear that we must do all we can to support our seniors who were
on track to graduate in this effort. This includes waiving high school credit requirements at both the local and state level if, and when,
necessary. Currently, our seniors must technically earn 23 credits* in specified areas to meet their graduation requirements. However, every
district adds additional credit requirements (3 credits in our case) onto the basic requirements established by the state (20 credits). In
summary, the minimum state requirement for graduation for this class is 20 credits and locally remains at 23 credits.

Our expectation is that students will continue their learning in a distance learning format for the remainder
of the year and earn the necessary credits to graduate. However, after a good faith effort has been made
to help students earn that required credit, there may still be some students who need special
consideration where a waiver is warranted. As such, the ability to access these two waiver options (local
and/or state level) would be used sparingly and granted on a case-by-case, student-by-student basis.

The impacts of the pandemic are unfortunate, and we agree that we want to do all we can to help our seniors find success in this final
chapter of their educational experience in the Bellingham School District. We are requesting the board adopt resolution 5-20.
