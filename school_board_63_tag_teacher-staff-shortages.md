The Blaine School District held a special board meeting on August 5, 2020 to discuss the reopening plan for the upcoming school year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger recommended a phased-in approach to returning students to classrooms, starting with remote learning and gradually introducing in-person instruction based on case statistics and community health guidelines.

Ultimately, the board decided to table the decision and hold another meeting on August 8th to allow for further community input and consideration.
