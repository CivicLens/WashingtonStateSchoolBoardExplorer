The City of Pullman Planning Commission held a regular meeting on June 28, 2023, during which a public hearing was conducted to review the proposed West End Villas Planned Residential Development. This development involves the division of 5.26 acres into 65 lots and public streets, situated north of Pullman High School and adjacent to NW High Point Court and NW Valley View Drive on Military Hill. Vice-Chair Brent Carper presided over the meeting, where staff member Lott presented a summary of the staff report, and written comments from various stakeholders were entered into the record as Attachment M. Notably, Commissioner O'Callaghan recused himself from the hearing due to a conflict of interest, as his employer is a part owner of the subject property. The meeting included a recess to allow Commissioners and the applicant to review the written comments before continuing with the proceedings.
