4. Board Work Session
School board directors were joined by City of Lynden personnel including Mayor Scott Korthuis,
City Administrator John Williams, Parks & Recreation personnel Bob Johnson & Greg Faber, and
City Councilmembers Gary Bode, Brent Lenssen, and Kyle Strengholt.
After brief introductions, Superintendent VanderYacht shared information about district facilities
planning committees that have worked over the last two years. Their work led to the bond and
levy funding initiatives that are on the ballot for the Feb. 13th special election. He then shared
information about capacity, projected enrollment and other projects that will need to be
addressed in the future. He shared information about impact fees and that discussions may be
held in the future about the district pursuing impact fees from the city.
Discussion continued regarding the project that will occur in front of the high school on Bradley
Rd. The project entails high school parking space modifications, and that work is scheduled to
begin this year. The modifications will allow for the addition of a pedestrian sidewalk along
Bradley Rd. The chain link fence will be removed as well. The intersection of Bradley Rd. and
Vinup continues to be a concern and discussion was held regarding ways to solve the traffic flow
problem there.
Superintendent VanderYacht shared about the district’s partnership with Inspire Development
Center. They currently use space at Isom Elementary. They will be working with the city on a
permit to construct a building with six classrooms on that property to serve students during the
summer. Discussion was held on impacts of surrounding neighborhoods and traffic for bus stops
and drop off.
Initial discussions with the district and the city are taking place regarding how to meet the needs
of early learners and senior citizens in the community. Discussion was also held regarding the
district’s service to homeless students and what that looks like.
Bob Johnson with Parks & Recreation updated the group with information about the work being
done as a result of the recently passed bond. The remainder of the money from that bond will be
used for the development of Benson Park which will include the restoration of the Heusinkvelt
Barn. Monies will also be used for Dickinson Park & the Jim Kaemingk Trail. Grants will also be
pursued in the coming years.
Mayor Korthuis provided Information on the street/sidewalk projects. Information on future
developments near the new Benson Park would cause the need for modified streets to
accommodate the development in that area. A roundabout is planned for Benson Rd/ Badger Rd.

Peace Health is finalizing construction and plans to open in April. Pepin Creek will see the
development of 1400-1600 homes which will cause increased enrollment in the school district.
Schoolyard Park has had a donor provide funds for the construction of an outdoor pavilion. There
will also be an entrance created on the south side. Parks & Recreation is looking to secure money
from the rotary for playground equipment. The Jim Kaemingk Trail is on track for the first
section to be completed in the fall.
Projects currently planned and/or under construction include Hannegan/ 1st Street, wastewater
treatment upgrade, and the development of commercial buildings west of the Guide. 9th Street/
Judson will be done this year, then 10th Street next year. Cedar Street will also be addressed.
The city expressed interest in running a trail on the south end of Isom which would entail
securing some of that land.
Discussion was then held regarding interagency emergency planning and response.
Superintendent VanderYacht spoke of the district’s Safety & Security Task Force which is working
to review the emergency planning and response protocols. The “I Love You Guys” emergency
planning program has been chosen and is being implemented by districts county wide. There is
an opportunity to work more closely with local law enforcement agencies to collaborate on
emergency response planning.
An opportunity for public input was then provided. No members of the public provided input.
The board and city personnel would like to plan to meet annually.
Rails to Trails was discussed regarding options for the railroad tracks near the high school.
Brent DeRuyter expressed an interest in collaborating use of the future Benson Park and would
like it to be a regional park site instead of a city park site.
Discussion was held regarding whether there were plans for supporting performing arts. The
outdoor pavilion planned for Glenning Park would support this.
The city also shared plans for a splash park.
