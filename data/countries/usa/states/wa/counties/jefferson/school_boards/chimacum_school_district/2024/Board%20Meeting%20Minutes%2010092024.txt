Superintendent/Management Reports
Levy Information Discussion
Executive Director of Business and Finance, Kelly Liske, joined to discuss options for the upcoming 2025
EP&O Levy.
The discussion was focused on the below questions.
The choice may be determined by what the board thinks is most important to our community:
•
•

•

Overall dollar figure – if this is too far off what we have asked for in the past will that create
confusion or concern with our constituents?
$X.XX per $1,000 – Are constituents focused on what it will cost them personally? They
approved $0.88 per $1,000 last time. If we ask for this, it will give us capacity for increased
enrollment, but we will likely have a rollback. Would that create confusion or are our
constituents be happy we collected less than we promised?
What are we spending this money on? What are our communication challenges?
