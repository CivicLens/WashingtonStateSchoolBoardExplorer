3. COMMUNICATIONS
a. Public Comment: There was none.
b. Administrator Reports: The Board had read the reports and did not have any questions or
comments.
c. MWC Presentation: MWC Principal explained there is a display cupboard near the front entrance
that was being underutilized. A number of years ago 1st Grade Teacher Colleen Christensen asked if she
could maintain it. Since then, she has chosen a theme each year and changed the display each month
with pictures, books and artifacts related to that theme. Colleen shared theme ideas from previous years
and that this year’s is The Wonders of the World. Each month a different world location has been
highlighted with displays of artifacts shared by staff that have visited those locations, plus a map, books
and other informational items. Each month the students are encouraged to ‘see’ the world beyond our
home in Highland, yet the final month’s display will showcase Highland with, similar to the other
month’s a location map, fiction and non-fiction books, and artifacts that represent our local cultures.
Colleen is already planning for next year, Super Heroes with fiction and non-fiction examples. Colleen
also maintains the salmon fish tank.

a. 2024-2025 Highly Capable: Andrea: The grant process has changed and the district needs Board
approval to move forward with the Hi-Cap assessments. We are in year two of our implementation plan,
this year 2nd and 5th graders will be assessed with the CoGAT (Cognitive Ability Assessment). This
assessment has three components: Verbal, Quantitative, and Nonverbal. We will create a
Multidisciplinary Selection Committee (MSC) to analyze collectively the CoGAT, STAR, SBA,
WaKIDS, Acadience and classroom-based assessments to discover which students qualify for Hi Cap.

BioMED: Global Health Camp, and the Out-of-State/Overnight Travel Request for Upward Bound to
Upward Bound Summer Academy @ Hatfield Science Center; motion carried.
c. Budget Status /Enrollment and Operations Report: Mark: Francis is out of state but since we have
been extensively reviewing the budget these past several weeks, there isn’t a report for tonight, he will
have an updated report at the next meeting. Enrollment: Enrollment and withdrawal numbers are equal
this month. We might be up five year-to-date but overall, the numbers are going down year to year. The
numbers of decreasing enrollment have been shared repeatedly.
b. Personnel Report: Mark: This month’s report shows the six teachers that are non-renewed:
Clemente, Greathouse, Leaverton, Marin, Price, and Shelton, one RIF: Kinney, and one retirement:
Larry Nevers. We posted to replace that tech position and Carlos Alvarez will return for which we are
very pleased. One Paternity Leave: Tejeda. Reassignments: Marisol Horta from HMS Science to HS
Science and Caitlyn Nation from TES 5th Grade teacher to HMS Math & ELA Intervention/Success
Teacher. We are posting for a Health Room Aide/Para for the 2024-2025 school year to support district
health needs, and for a substitute nurse. Extracurricular: Unfortunately, the numbers are too low in MS
Track & Field and we had to release second coach, Millard Smith, from his contract. Carlos moved,
