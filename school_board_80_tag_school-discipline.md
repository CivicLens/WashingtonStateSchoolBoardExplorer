The Wahluke School Board held a special meeting on January 30, 2024, where community engagement was emphasized, particularly through presentations from the High School PSO aiming to increase parental involvement and raise funds for scholarships. Reports included updates on discipline and attendance data, with a goal of reducing chronic absenteeism by 15% district-wide. The Superintendent reported a projected $1.4 million budget deficit for the 2023-24 school year, attributing this to declining enrollment and the failure of a local levy. Numerous policies were reviewed and adopted, including Policy 3112 on Social Emotional Climate and Policy 3241 on Student Discipline, which aim to enhance school safety and address student needs. The board also approved several policies related to student privacy, such as Policy 3231 on Student Records and Policy 3220 on Freedom of Expression, indicating a focus on protecting student rights and data.
