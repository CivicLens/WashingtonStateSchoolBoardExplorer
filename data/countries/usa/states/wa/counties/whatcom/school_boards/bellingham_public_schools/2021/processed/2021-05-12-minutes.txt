OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
May 12, 2021 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Mason called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. She acknowledged that this meeting,
while attended from various locations, is being held on the ancestral homelands of the
Coast Salish people. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz
Hackler, Jenn Mason (President), Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri
O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
Ms. Mason noted that, because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19, public
participation is limited to written submissions only, and all written comments received
will be shared with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all messages
received.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
A few years ago, the district made an investment in a grant writer position that is now
shared by Gretchen Pflueger and Amelia Vader. It was a beneficial investment that has
resulted in the district and its community partners being the recipient of many grants.
Washington state has put an emphasis on early childhood education for several years, and
the district recently applied to the state for a grant made available by the federal
American Families Plan. The purpose of the grant is to encourage businesses to build onsite early learning centers. The new district office will include an early learning center,
and Assistant Superintendent of Teaching and Learning Kristi Dominguez, Ms. Pflueger
and Ms. Vader shared details about the grant and answered questions from the board.
A board member had requested additional information on behavioral health following the
last meeting, when a contract linked to a CARES Act grant was submitted for approval.
Dr. Baker introduced Executive Director of Teaching and Learning Trina Hall, who in
turn introduced Chris Cochran, mental health coordinator; Laura Burke, mental health
specialist; and Stevona Burks, Meghan Lever and Selene Meza, prevention intervention
specialists. The team reviewed the framework that outlines mental health supports
available to students, which include weekly check-ins with students in need of emotional
support; peer support; in-house resources and community resources. Other services
available include a weekly wellness support group that meets via Zoom and peer-centered
outreach, a club that was student initiated. Ms. Burke spoke about professional

development related to mental health and how she supports students who need intensive
intervention. The team then responded to questions and comments from board members.
The state legislature has finished its session and finalized the state budget, and now OSPI
and attorneys are working to interpret the impact to school districts. The district continues
to review the feedback received regarding its 2021-22 budget and will bring a refined
budget to the board to review at its June 9 meeting.
Our district, staff and a member of our board received national attention last week after a
web post went viral about the book, I Am Jazz about a transgender girl. Many staff have
been engaged in responding to inquiries. The national feedback has been mainly negative,
with local feedback being more supportive. It has sparked conversations, and staff will
continue to engage with families, staff and others who have questions or comments. Dr.
Baker believes it is important that students and families see themselves in literature.
Dr. Baker will be attending an upcoming meeting with the health department and
Whatcom County superintendents. There have been questions about whether school
districts will require students and staff to be vaccinated. That requirement would come
from the state, who looks to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for guidance. At
some point, vaccination may be mandated by the state Department of Health and the
governor. With the expectation that all students will be able to return to school full time
in the fall, online learning will continue to be offered for families who believe that is the
best option for their family. New guidance is expected about masks, social distancing,
etc. Dr. Baker responded to questions from board members.
Dr. Baker presented a PowerPoint highlighting retiring staff.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Mr. Benjamin read a statement he had prepared which addressed the threatening and
intimidating communications that have been received by the school board and district
staff over the past week. He noted that hate and exclusion directed towards certain
classes of people should not and will not be tolerated. These events are evidence that
the district’s equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) efforts are necessary.
• Ms. Bashaw thanked Mr. Benjamin for his statement. She expressed her support of
district staff in their efforts to be inclusive of all students. The Bellingham Promise
states that we love all children. She strongly supports Ms. Mason and feels that the
district is fortunate to have her serving on the school board.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler stated that she agrees with the other board members, noting that
some people have tried to hide their hate by incorrectly citing bible verses.
• Ms. Mason recognizes that it takes a lot of time, resources and energy to respond to
issues that draw media attention, and she thanked everyone who has turned their time

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The Board recognizes the significant work to continue improving dropout rates and long-term
trends of increased graduation rates. Overall, the superintendent’s work has moved BPS from
graduation rates near the state average in 2010 to above average in 2019. Graduates with IEPs are
also enrolling in higher education at rates higher than the state average. In particular, there has
been commendable progress in improving graduation rates for students receiving free/reduced
meals and Hispanic/Latinx students. The board appreciates the work done to encourage and add
opportunities for students to participate in dual credit courses. There has also been a significant
increase in the number of students earning industry certificates.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
While overall graduation trends are on a long-term positive trajectory, the board hopes to see
graduation rates for ELL students and students who receive free/reduced meals to continue
improving.
4. Comments on the report itself.
The board appreciates the data and graphs included in the report, as well as the information about
why students have dropped out.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• Appreciate all that the District has had to do of constantly pivoting during this pandemic.
• Edgenuity for secondary level and Accelerate Education program for elementary for
continued online learning.
• DreamBox (supplemental tools) for math. A high majority of third, fourth, and fifth grade
students on track this year. Both DreamBox and Lexia are able to generate real time data for
assessing students.
• Purchase of devices for P-2.
• Promise K up to 8 sites with 124 students.
• Work progressing with the hire of a Mental Health and EDI Coordinator.
DB:
• Remarkable ability to reimplement digital resources in order to continue learning during the
abrupt shift to at-home during the COVID-19 pandemic, and cope with dramatically shifting
demands, e.g., growth at BFPP and fully remote options.
• In spite of the pandemic the superintendent continued to progress in initiatives that were
started previously. Most notably the hiring of an EDI director, expansion in mental health,
wellness and math instruction.
• The evidence shows how advantage was taken from the “push” of the pandemic demands to
accelerate the exploration of many new instructional methods and platforms.

amazing!

• Implementing new online teaching and assessment tools like Dreambox and Lexia to adapt

programming.

technology, knowledge and planning to do so successfully.
• Continued progress around EDI with the hiring of Dr. Valesquez-Farmer.
• Overall, this school year pushed the limits of adapting academics and everything that goes
along with it to remote/hybrid learning, often at an incredibly rapid pace. Much appreciation
for all staff in this effort and the leadership it takes in these major system shifts.

Identity and Diversity).

suddenly upon the entire school system due to the pandemic and a move to online/hybrid
learning. This is evidenced by the major schedule adjustments and incorporation of
unexpected professional development.
• Impressive to see the percentage of out of class professional development continue to drop.
• There is clear evidence of a remarkable amount of ongoing communication out to the
community on the many evolving changes due to the pandemic. This is consistent with
feedback from other sources.

environment.

innovation that has occurred due to the pandemic.
