Travel Request - Robotics to Housotn TX April 16-24.pdf (806 KB)

Motion & Voting
Chris Beyrouty and students presented the details of the travel request recommendation. The club must
place in top 5 at Districts competition to be invited to the World Competition in Houston, TX. The Board
reviewed the budget worksheet presented and discussed the details and cost of the travel request. The
Board voiced its concerns about the overall cost of the trip, the number of chaperones presented, and
the number of vehicles need to transport students to the event. The club does not have funding secured
to travel at the time of this request and the Board wants detials about chaperones to assure the student
to chaperone ratio is met. Mr. Beyrouty commented the club has a plan in place to raise the needed
funds, and the number of students attending and the number of vehicles needed has decreased.
The Board will approve the request contingent on the team placing at Districts to qualify to compete,
revising the request to include an accurate list of chaperones, revise the budget worksheet to reflect
actual costs, and the club must secure the funding need to travel to this event.

1st Reading Revised Policy No. 5280 Separation from Employment
WSSDA has revised this policy to clarify the school boards role in the process of terminating
staff. The boards role differs depending on the type of employee thats being terminated. As
described, with classified employees, the board plays one role, but with certificated employees,
the board plays another. Under Policy 5280, the superintendent recommends to the board
whether a classified employee should be terminated, and the board makes the decision.Policy
5280 reflects the boards role in certificated employees terminations. The policy no longer has
the board considering notices of probable cause and rendering decisions about discharges or
non-renewals. In making those changes, WSSDA clearly delineates the different processes for
terminating certificated employees and terminating classified employees.

Reviewed Policy No. 5271 and Revised Procedure No. 5271P - Reporting Improper
Governmental Action (Whistleblower Protection)
Washington has different laws governing whistleblower protections at the state and local
government levels. The Local Government Whistleblower Protection Act, Ch. 42.41 RCW, is the
chapter that governs local governments, such as school districts. The intent of Protecting the
Whistleblower MODEL POLICY & PROCEDURE 5271 Reporting Improper Governmental Action
(Whistleblower Protection) the statute is to encourage disclosure of improper actions by local
government officials and employees. The statute protects employees from retaliation and
provides remedies if retaliation occurs.
Given the importance of this statute, WSSDA recently reviewed and updated model policy and
procedure 5271 Reporting Improper Governmental Action (Whistleblower Protection) to ensure it
aligns with Washingtons Local Government Whistleblower Protection Act. The revisions include
re-categorizing this policy to accurately reflect that it is an Essential policy. Additionally, weve
revised the definition of retaliatory action and added a prohibition against intimidation to reflect
the statute more fully and accurately. The revisions also update contact information reflecting
federal, state, and local entities that enforce potential improper governmental actions.
