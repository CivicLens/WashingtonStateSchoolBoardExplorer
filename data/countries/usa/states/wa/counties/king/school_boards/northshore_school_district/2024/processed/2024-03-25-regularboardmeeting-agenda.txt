Public Content
Summary:

The Northshore School District Board of Directors has set aside a period of up to 60 minutes to receive updates and comments
fromDistrictassociation leaders and community members.As referenced in multiple policies adopted by The Board, we expect all parties
addressing the Board to present their comments in a way that is civil and respectful. This means that whether we are school directors,
district staff, students, members of the community, or some other guest, we must all follow the same standard of civility during school board
meetings. Please speak directly to the Board and address matters related to district operations, policies, procedures, and agenda items
under consideration by the Board.
Washington State law requires that the Board limit its business and discussionat the Board meetingto onlythoseitems that have been
captured in the previously published agenda. What that means for us today:
Any public comment regarding itemsthat are includedin the published agenda will be taken into consideration by the Board when the
topic is addressed during the agenda.
Any topics brought up during public comment that are notincludedin the published agenda cannot, by law, be discussed at this
meeting and so will not be addressed or receive a response during the meeting.
In either case, depending on the nature ofyourtopic or questions,a district employee or a board member will follow up onany comments that
relate to district business.Please note that the boards silence during public comment is neutral. It is neither a signal of agreement nor
disagreement with the speakers remarks.
Also please note that comments should not make referenceto any employee or representative of the Districtby name or by identifiable
reference.If you are interested in makingcomments or complaints regardingan individual, you may use thecomplaint process available
through the Office of the Superintendent.
Finally, please remember that your words have impact and you, not the school district, are responsible for your words. We caution all
speakers that it is possible that your statements could violate the rights of others under various laws, including laws protecting privacy and
laws prohibiting defamation. If you are unsure of the legal effect of your remarks, you should seek independent legal advice. In any case, we
ask that you help us model for our students what a respectful and inclusive community looks and sounds like.

Summary:
To ensure the successful completion of the Kenmore and Maywood Hills Elementary School
modernization projects on time and within budget, the District Capital Projects department, in
collaboration with our design-build partner Lease Crutcher Lewis, is proactively securing essential
materials for this summer's construction phase. This strategic action is necessary due to potential
disruptions in the supply chain and rising costs of construction materials. By securing these materials in
advance, we aim to mitigate these risks and safeguard the project's established budget and timeline. To

facilitate this initiative, the Board's approval is required for Amendment #3. Amendment #3 specifically
authorizes the involvement of competitively selectedmechanical, electrical, and sitework subcontractors
and allows for the procurement of essential equipment and pre-fabricated structures necessary for the
construction of the project.

2. Authorization to Surplus a Portable

Action

Preferred Date :

Mar 25, 2024

Absolute Date :

Mar 25, 2024

Recommended Action :

Administration recommends that the Board declare one
portable at Crystal Springs Elementary surplus.

Public Content
Summary:
Board Policy No. 7251 authorizes the Board of Directors to declare equipment including relocatable
facilities as surplus property when the determined aggregate value of the property is greater than
$20,000. This represents the first step in disposing of property that has no further use to the District.
The District has one portable at Crystal Springs Elementary with an estimated value of $31,000 that is no
longer needed. The portable will need to be removed in late June 2024 due to planned modernization
activities at the school. In order to maintain this schedule, the Department would like to declare this
portable surplus at this time. Assigning this portable surplus status will allow the District to move ahead
with the required 30-day public notification on its possible sale. In addition, this would allow potential
buyers time to obtain bids for the removal and transportation of the portable prior to the hectic summer
schedule.

Motion & Voting
Administration recommends that the Board declare one portable at Crystal Springs Elementary surplus.
