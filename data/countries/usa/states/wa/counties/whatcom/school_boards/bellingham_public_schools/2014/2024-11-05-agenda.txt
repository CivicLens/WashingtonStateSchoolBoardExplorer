Explanation of Issue:
As you know, part of our 2013 Bond program is to replace the existing Happy Valley Elementary School
with a new school on the same site. Because of Happy Valley's age and condition, the state will provide
funding assistance to help construct a new building in lieu of modernization of the current building. This is
known as a 'new in lieu' project.
To be eligible for new in lieu construction funding assistance, the district must certify that the existing
facility will not be used in the future for instructional purposes or be eligible for future state financial
assistance.
I am requesting that the board adopt the attached Resolution 18-14 which will enable us to pursue new in
lieu construction funding assistance for the Happy Valley Elementary School project.

Explanation of Issue:
I am recommending the district hire W. Thomas Follis to appraise the value of a small piece of property located south of Halleck
Street. The parcel is approximately 12 feet wide and 60 feet long and shaded orange on the attached plat map. The owner of a
home located immediately adjacent to the parcel is requesting the district grant a non-exclusive easement for ingress, egress,
and parking over the property. The home owner has used the property for ingress, egress, and parking for many years (as have
previous owners). The first step in resolving this matter is to have the value of the property determined by an appraisal. The
district will be reimbursed for the cost of the appraisal. I recommend you authorize the hiring of W. Thomas Follis to appraise the
property.
