Action (Consent)

For projects that are eligible for the states School Construction Assistance Program, the district must
submit assurances to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) that its attendance policies
will not create or aggravate racial imbalances as defined by WAC 392-342-025(2). A racial imbalance is
considered to exist when:
1. The combined minority enrollment of a school varies from the district-wide combined minority
percentage by more than plus or minus 25% points; or
2. A schools enrollment of a single minority group with a district-wide enrollment of less than 30%
exceeds 50%; or

exceeds the minority groups district-wide percentage by 20% or more.
The district-wide combined minority enrollment as of October 1, 2023 was 61.6%. On October 1, 2023,
Norman Rockwell Elementary Schools combined minority enrollment percentage was 69.2%. The
combined minority group enrollment has been based on the definitions of Washington States ESSA
Consolidated Plan and includes all race/ethnicity groups except white.
Therefore, the proposed project will not create or aggravate a racial imbalance within the school district
as defined by WAC 392-342-025 as:
1. The combined minority enrollment of Norman Rockwell Elementary School (69.2%) does not
exceed the district-wide minority average (61.6%) by more than plus or minus 25 percentage points.
2.

2. No district-wide minority group with less than 30% enrollment exceeds 50% enrollment at Norman
Rockwell Elementary School.
3. No single minority group at Norman Rockwell Elementary School exceeds the district-wide minority
group with more than 30% enrollment (39.4%) by 20 percentage points or more.
RECOMMENDATION
The Board of Directors approves Resolution No. 2383 certifying that the proposed construction of the
Norman Rockwell Elementary School Rebuild and Enlarge project will not create or aggravate a racial
imbalance.

Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors adopts Resolution No. 2384,
Closure of the Futures School, as recommended.

Public Content
Situation:
At the May 20, 2024 Board Meeting, Superintendent Holmen provided a recommendation to the Board to
take action to close the Futures School. A public hearing was also held at the May 20, 2024 Board
Meeting. The Futures School was opened in 1999 to address credit deficiency and to increase
engagement and social emotional well-being of students. While the Futures School provided a muchneeded support for students, the school has experienced significant decline in enrollment and did not
enroll students from outside of the Juanita High School boundary starting in 2014-15. No students have
been enrolled in the school over the last two years. Additionally, the LWSD has credit recovery and social
and behavioral health supports at all high schools which has reduced the need for a stand-alone and
unique program.
Recommendation:
The Board of Directors adopts Resolution No. 2384, Closure of the Futures School, as recommended.
