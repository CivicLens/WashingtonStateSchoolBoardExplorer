The regular meeting of the school board on February 27, 2024, included discussions on several policy changes, notably the adoption of revised policies related to student health and safety, including Policy 3418 on Response to Student Injury or Illness, Policy 3419 on Self-Administration of Asthma and Anaphylaxis Medications, and Policy 3420 on Anaphylaxis Prevention and Response. Each of these revisions was approved unanimously by the board. Additionally, the board discussed anti-bullying policies and procedures, reflecting a commitment to student well-being. 

The meeting also addressed community engagement, with student representatives reporting on events such as the DECCA State Career Development and the musical "Anastasia." Furthermore, legislative updates were provided, including a proposed resolution opposing HB2331 and SB5462, which prompted a discussion on the board's influence on state legislation and the need for further understanding of its implications for the district. Dr. Dominguez will seek legal guidance regarding these legislative matters.
