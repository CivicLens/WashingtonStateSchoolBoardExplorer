Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation
Approval of the contract completion for the Denny Yasuhara Middle School construction project by Bouten Construction of
Spokane.
Background/Rationale
The architect, MMEC Architecture & Interiors of Spokane, and the Capital Projects staff have certified that the above project is
complete, and the contractor has fulfilled their obligations under the contract documents.
This project was for the construction of a new 141,965square foot middle school. The 2-level facility consists of eight multiclassroom neighborhoods, CTE classrooms, Music and Art classrooms, Library, nutritional and learning commons spaces with
integrated learning stair, full-size kitchen, gymnasium and locker rooms, administrative offices, and various support spaces.
The site has three exterior courtyard spaces that are fully secured for students and staff, multiple athletic fields, a playground,
staff and public parking, bus loading/unloading loop, and parent drop off area.
The total cost for this project including change orders was $50,309,107.87 plus sales tax. The project was funded by the voterapproved 2018 Bond. The Districts project manager for the work was Randy Lasswell.

Public Content
Recommendation:
Approval of Small Wares Prime Vendor contract renewal to Bargreen Ellingson Restaurant Supply and Design, Spokane, WA, for an
anticipated estimated amount of $125,000.00 for the 2024-2025 fiscal year.
Background:
This recommendation is to renew an exclusive, or prime vendor, contract for the purchase of small, low dollar, durable items used by
Nutrition Services programs district wide. With the volume of small wares that are purchased annually, it was deemed more efficient to utilize
a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation to award a single contract rather than obtaining multiple quotations throughout the year. By
renewing this type of prime vendor contract, the district can maintain consistency in equipment and arrange for individual, emergency site
drop-offs when circumstances require immediate delivery. The RFP pricing can be accessed by all district departments. This recommended
renewal to Bargreen Ellingson will access the third of four optional one-year contract periods as provided in the RFP specifications. Since
the requested dollar amount is only an anticipated estimate, it is also recommended that the board approve additional expenditures of 10%
over the initial contracted amount if deemed necessary by the Nutrition Services supervisors. This expenditure will be paid from the general
fund.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Public Content
Recommendation:
Approval of purchase order contract issued to SA Piazza Associates, LLC, Clackamas, OR, in the anticipated approximate
amount of $350,000.00 for pizza, cheese bread sticks and other products processed with USDA cheese commodities per the
terms and conditions of NEWESD 101 Contract No. 10120211.
Background:
On June 10, 2020, with approval from the school board, the district entered into an Interlocal Agreement with NEWESD 101 that
allows access to their contracts that have been awarded via competitive solicitation. The district has been accessing Contract
No. 10120211 for SA Piazza Associates ready-to-bake pizza and other cheese-containing products for the school lunch program
for four years. These products have been successfully received by the students of our district and meets the federal child
nutrition standards. By accessing this contract, we are able to utilize our USDA cheese commodity allocations, thereby saving
the district money by not having the extra expense of purchasing cheese purchased on the open market to provide this type of
product.
The district is familiar with the awarded vendor of this contract. SA Piazza has participated in previous solicitations issued by our
Purchasing Department. They scored well in the product taste evaluation and offer items that are appealing to our Districts
students. It is therefore recommended that a purchase order contract be issued for the 2024-2025 fiscal year. This expenditure
will be from the general fund.

USDA Commodities

Meeting :

Category :

5. CONSENT AGENDA

Type :

Action (Consent)

Public Content
Recommendation:
Approve issuance of a purchase order to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) to pay for shipping charges for USDA
food commodities in the anticipated amount of $180,000.00 for the 2024-25 fiscal year.
Background:
This recommended purchase provides for the payment of all freight costs associated with the delivery of USDA food products
received from OSPI, the single source supplier of these items. This is accomplished in two ways, the products are shipped
directly to the districts warehouse for internal distribution and the bulk food items (beef, cheese and chicken) are shipped to our
processing contractors to be made into usable portion products (e.g. hamburger patties, sliced & shredded cheese and shredded
chicken meat, among others).
This federal program offers staple food products to school districts at a reduced or no cost. These products supplement the
districts purchased dry and frozen foods procured for our nutrition services program and allows the district to offer nutritious,
economical meals to our students without having to procure the entire inventory from wholesale distributors at higher prices.
These USDA food items are utilized in district kitchens before ordering the higher priced items supplied by our vendor partners.
These goods include products such as flour, beef, chicken, cheese, canned, fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables and other
food products periodically made available from growers in the U.S. Not only does this program benefit the district by helping to
maintain a cost-effective school meal program, it also helps support the agricultural base in the U.S. This expenditure will be paid
from the general fund.

Supplemental Prime Vendor Accessing RFP 7-2122

Meeting :

Aug 14, 2024 - Regular Meeting

5. CONSENT AGENDA

Type :

Action (Consent)

Public Content
Recommendation:
Approval of a purchase order contract awarded to Good Source Solutions/Gold Star Foods, Emmett, ID, in an anticipated
amount not to exceed $450,000.00 for USDA-approved meal items during the 2024-25 fiscal year.
Background:
As the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the supply chain nationwide limiting product availability, school districts found themselves
in the unique situation of being unable to secure USDA approved school meal program menu items necessary to provide
nutritious meals for their students. This disruption forced last-minute menu changes and substitutions that caused challenges
with the production and communication related to special dietary accommodations.
The district has a Prime Vendor RFP awarded to US Foods which provides the majority of the menu items for the school meal
program. US Foods has continued to partner well with the district; however, during the pandemic they struggled with accessing
products and having enough drivers available to distribute these items. In an effort to minimize unexpected changes and provide
a stable supply of core meal program products, staff developed a plan that would allow the district to have a back-up distributor
to act as a Supplemental Prime Vendor should the primary Prime Vendor be unable to provide necessary products. This RFP
has allowed the district to acquire key products that helped stabilize product availability for the school meal program. Because of
the convenience of not having to search for food items vital to our meal production, the decision has been made that it would be
in the best interest of the district to allow this RFP award to continue.
This RFP was issued to the food distributors located in the Spokane/Northern Idaho area and also advertised on a public
purchasing website. We received notification from two of the large local distributors (URM and Sysco) indicating that they were
not in a position to supply these types of products and could not make deliveries as requested. Good Source Solutions/Gold Star
Foods was the only distributor able to submit a proposal. The district has utilized this firm regularly during the past 18 years and
finds them to be very accommodating when we have been faced with urgent circumstances. This award will be accessing the
third of four additional, optional one-year contracts as allowed in the RFP specifications. The pricing is deemed fair and
reasonable. This expenditure will be paid from the general fund.

TOTAL

$45,705.08

Background:
The district purchases approximately $250,000.00 of paper products annually that are stocked in the warehouse and supplied to
schools as needed. The bid climate for these products does not produce the best pricing if the product price is held for an
extended period. In order obtain the best possible pricing, a solicitation is issued every 3-4 months.
Given the total expenditure for the product requires a bid, each purchase will be solicited as a formal bid. The Purchasing office
utilizes an electronic solicitation system, Public Purchase, which allows for efficient solicitation and tabulation making more
frequent solicitations possible.
All recommended awards are to the lowest responsible bidder offering acceptable products. In the event that products identified
are determined unacceptable for district use or the vendor is unable to provide the product as bid, it is further recommended that
authorization be granted to proceed to the next low bidder(s) and award to that bidder whose product fully meets acceptance
criteria. Actual purchase orders may be adjusted slightly to accommodate specific product packing quantities.

TOTAL

$46,839.18

Background:
The district purchases approximately $235,000.00 of school supplies annually that are stocked in the warehouse and supplied to
schools as needed. The bid climate for these products does not produce the best pricing if the product price is held for an
extended period, much like copier paper. In order obtain the best possible pricing a solicitation will be issued every 3-4 months.
Given the total expenditure for the product requires a bid, each purchase will be solicited as a formal bid. The Purchasing office
utilizes an electronic solicitation system, Public Purchase, which allows for efficient solicitation and tabulation making more
frequent solicitations possible.
All recommended awards are to the low responsible bidder offering acceptable products. In the event that products identified are
determined unacceptable for district use or the vendor is unable to provide the product as bid, it is further recommended that
authorization be granted to proceed to the next low bidder(s) and award to that bidder whose product fully meets acceptance
criteria. Actual purchase orders may be adjusted slightly to accommodate specific product packing quantities.

Q. Bid No. 29-2223; Produce for the Fresh Fruits and
Vegetables Grant and Summer Feeding Program

Meeting :

Aug 14, 2024 - Regular Meeting

Category :

5. CONSENT AGENDA

Type :

Public Content
Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order to US Food, Inc., Spokane, WA, in the estimated amount of $540,000.00 for fresh produce to be
consumed by students at various low-income elementary schools named in an awarded grant for the USDA Fresh Fruits and
Vegetables Program during the 2024-2025 school year, and to supply fresh produce for the 2025 Summer Feeding Program city
wide.
Background:
On July 9, 2024, the district received notification that 17 elementary schools (Arlington, Audubon, Bemiss, Cooper, Garfield,
Grant, Holmes, Lidgerwood, Linwood, Logan, Longfellow, Madison, Regal, Scott, Stevens, Whitman and Willard) had been
allocated funds to participate in the USDA Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program during the 2024-2025 school year. This
program allows for students to have access to fresh produce daily during their in-class snack breaks in an effort to garner their
interest in choosing a healthy option when selecting snacks during the day. In addition to the students benefit of receiving fresh
produce throughout the school year, the grant also encourages the district to purchase locally grown fresh produce from qualified
producers, thereby bolstering the state growers economy. The upcoming school year will be the districts 15th year of
participation in this grant program.
For evaluation purposes during the original bid issued in June 2023, the Nutrition Services department provided a list of produce
that is typically ordered and the historic quantities for those items. This list encompassed many of our purchases throughout the
year, however not all. Since none of the participating vendors were able to offer pricing for all of our selected products,
adjustments were made to account for the missing items from each vendor. This adjusted total was used to determine the overall
low bidder. It was recommended that US Foods, Inc. be awarded this bid. They have been a successful business partner with
the district for the past several years and Food Services of America before their acquisition by US Foods. Prices from this bid are
considered fair and reasonable, and consistent with current market values. While the recommended total is an estimate based
on historical purchases at todays pricing, it is also recommended that the school board approve a contingency amount of 10%.
Should the expenditure exceed that 10% overage, a revised dollar amount will be presented to the board for further approval. In
addition to supplying produce for the grant program, this contract will also allow for fresh fruit to be included in the summer
breakfast and lunch feeding program that is available city wide to all children aged 1 through 18. This is a federally funded child

nutrition program to feed children when school is closed for the summer. This renewal accesses the first of four optional oneyear renewal contracts. This expenditure will be paid from the general fund as provided by the USDA Fresh Fruit and Vegetable
Grant and the federal Summer Feeding Program.

Recommendation:
Approve an increase of $110,000 for the implementation of OpenSciEd curriculum.

Background:
The Adoption Team selected two providers for materials used for the Middle School Science Adoption of
an Open Educational Resource for Science (OpenSciEd) which were approved by the School Board in
April 2023. Cost estimates were provided for the full implementation and future years through 2033.
Implementation materials for the first phase were purchased in Summer 2023 for use in the 2023-24
school year. As the materials were implemented during the 2023-2024 school year, materials from both
providers had unforeseen quality control issues.
Due to those quality control issues, staff reevaluated the providers of materials and is recommending
changes to ensure the quality of materials as follows:

Identified alternate suppliers for pre-printed materials.
Modified the implementation plan to replace the teacher guides (one year only).
Non-consumables will be purchased from more standard providers and distributed to the sites to
add to their non-consumable kits.
Cost estimate for 2023-2024 was $3,44,977 for the initial purchase of materials. An increase of
up to $110,000 is necessary to implement the change of suppliers.
