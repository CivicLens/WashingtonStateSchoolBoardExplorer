  2. Public Hearing Resolution No. 24-19 - F200 / 2023-2024 Budget Extension:
A. Public Hearing Resolution No. 24-19 - F200 / 2023-2024 General Fund Budget Extension – President Deyo opened the public hearing at 5:08. PPT is available in BoardDocs.
  Superintendent, Director of Finance, Human Resources, and Operations David Cram presented a PPT on the proposed 2023-2024 General Fund Budget Extension and explained that when we adopt our budget, which for our school district we always adopt in July, because of the size of the district, larger districts are allowed to adopt up to August 31 which allows them to see if anything else comes in through the summer to make adjustments to that final budget. But for us, because we're a small district we have to adopt the budget in July.
  When we adopted our budget last July, we were waiting to find out whether or not we were going to get the 21st Century Grant. On August 31, 2023, we learned that we received the 21st Century Grant for $425,000 in the first fiscal year. We’ll receive revenues coming in a little over 400,000 in expenditures to offset that record. We need to do a budget extension that allows us to extend our expenditures and our appropriations because we’re capped on how much we can spend within a fiscal year. The presentation explains the resolution extends the budget by $1.3 million. Although he doesn’t foresee the need to spend the $1.3 million but wants the capacity in case something else pops up in the last several weeks.
  The other items that you'll see in this budget extension are, we had other grants that came in throughout the year that we weren't anticipating. Food Services Director Kelly Kjarstad received about $90,000 in grants that we were not anticipating at the time that came in, and we have expenditures. Ryan Hiller also received a $150,000 grant.
  The expenditure amount is up to $13,386,074 and the projection of our ending fund balance is about $512,000 which is a very conservative number that is achievable. He anticipated the numbers would be coming in higher than he had projected. He is quite confident that the district would be above the binding conditions that are set forth for us and is hopeful that the district will get out of binding conditions this fall. OSPI stated that when we close our books, which is August 31, if we meet the thresholds that they require, we can come out of binding conditions. We close our books in October and November which means we probably will come out of binding in December or January very optimistic about that.
  We also are asking for a budget extension for the capital projects and the capital projects are about a $250,000 increase in expenditures that we're asking for, and this is around the solar grant. We received that Solar Grant in June. We were notified by the State of Washington that we received the award for $1.9 million. I want to build capacity in August, because there may be some expenditures that happen in that month that we weren't able to build that capacity so he wants to make sure the district has the capacity.
  Later tonight the board will consider approving Cascadia Renewables as the project management team for the solar project. There might be some initial expenditures this month that they're going to turn in, which we need to pay for, which is why I want to make sure that we have the capacity built for that.
President Deyo asked three times if anyone had any comments they wanted to share. There wasn’t any public comment. President Deyo closed the public hearing.

  5. Discussion Item:
A. Cell Phone Policy – Director of Teaching and Learning Beth Clothier presented information on implementing procedures to go with Policy 3240 regarding cell phone use and access during the school day. The Cabinet has done a lot of work over the summer. We want to foster a learning environment where students can nurture their curiosity, build relationships, think critically, develop resilience, and pursue wellness. We believe that the removal of cell phones, smartwatches, and headsets during the school day enables us to create opportunities for students to engage with each other, with their teachers, and with their academics, free from the pressures and distractions of social media and text messaging and achieve at higher levels while promoting healthy social and emotional development.
  Every two years, students in grades 6, 8, 10, and 12 participate in the Healthy Youth Survey. Our students completed this survey in the fall of 2023, and, although district-specific data is not available for two of the measures, the results raise concerns. The Healthy Youth Survey combines data from questions about internet/media use into an "at risk" measure at the county and state levels. The table below compares the percentage of Skagit County students at each grade level who reported problematic internet use in 2021 and 2023.
  The goal is to help students by reducing distractions, improving social interactions, decreasing anxiety, and guiding them toward success. So, starting in the 2024-25 school year, we’re committed to creating a cell phone-free learning environment for our students. Having a cell phone-free school enables us to focus on the district's strategic plan for all learners to Engage, Connect, and Achieve. 
  As we make this shift, we want to hear concerns and questions from students, staff, families, and community members. The flyer provides a QR Code and link to provide feedback, so we can provide more information and solutions to their concerns. This way, we can ensure that our community, families, and students have the answers and support needed to make this a smooth and healthy transition.

We have met and received support from our unions, PTSA, Booster Club, ESAs, the Swinomish Tribe Chairman, and the Senate. School Districts all around us are implementing a new policy and procedures regarding cell phones. We’ve tried unsuccessfully for two years to limit the use of cell phone use in the classrooms. Now, we’re following the Mercer Island School District’s implementation process and they are going cell phone-free during the entire school day. We plan to use Yondr pouches for high school students and locked cases for middle school students. Upon entering school buildings (phone-free space), high school students will place their phones inside a Yondr pouch, middle school students will place their phones in a locked case, and they will be locked throughout the school day while on campus. High School students will maintain possession of their phone. Before leaving campus, the students will need to unlock the Yondr pouch to access their phones. Middle School students will store their personal electronics in a locked case that will be securely stored in the office and returned to students at the end of the day.
  We will be posting more information on our website, including answers to the frequently asked questions gathered here. A flyer was presented to the school board for feedback before distribution.
  The board of directors stated we have discussed this topic for over two years. The director met a few different times with students and staff. The board of directors supports the proposal to go with cell phone-free schools. The policy and procedure are aimed at creating more intentional learning environments and promoting healthy social and emotional development. We want to ensure that our schools are engaging our students intellectually and that we’re making sure they’re connected socially and equipped for the future.
