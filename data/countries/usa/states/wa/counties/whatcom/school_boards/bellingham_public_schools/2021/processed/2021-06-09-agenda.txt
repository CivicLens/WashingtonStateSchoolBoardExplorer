Staff submitted the attached resolution in connection with
the Capital Facilities Plan. As superintendent, I have

Public Content
Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer,Director of Capital Projects;Simone Sangster, Assistant
Superintendent of Finance
Explanation of Issue:
As allowed by the Growth Management Act, (1990) the Bellingham School District collects school impact
fees. These fees are used to pay a portion of the cost of new facilities attributable to new growth,while
state and local funds provide the majority of that funding.
To collect impact fees, a board-adopted Capital Facilities Plan is required which identifies anticipated
enrollment trends, service standards, capacity informationand other components. A new plan must be
adopted in order to update city and county records underlying impact feecalculations,to reflect current
projections and building plans. Over the coming years, we may change and update items contained in
this report. As you know, we currently have no formal plans for a bond issue although this is also
reviewed annually in light of enrollment trends, economic conditions, and other factors.
The proposed school impact fees are$4,133(2016; $2,242) for each single-family residence and $1,793
(2016; $229) for each multiple-family residence.These amounts reflect the increased cost of construction
and an increase in the number of students being generated from multi-family housing units. As in the
past, the fee also applies a discount factor of 25% to the total allowable fee by recognizing the need for
affordable housing and that new development should not bear the total cost of new school construction. A
copy of the complete proposed Capital Facilities Plan for School Impact Fees is attached. Also attached
is a sample of current school impact fees which provides some perspective on the amount of other school
district impact fees in Western Washington.

Explanation of Issue:
Dawson Construction has begun construction of the new Sunnyland Elementary, with the initial Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP)
Amendment No. 1 having been approved by the board at its March 10, 2021 meeting. As we continue to work toward approval of city
permits, Dawson has been bidding subcontractor packages to secure pricing. This work included bidding and material procurement of
several critical subcontractor packages, including doors and hardware, mechanical, electrical and earthwork.To execute subcontracts
and commence with these activities, the district must execute an additional amendment to the GMPfor the project.
This second amendment specifies the scope of the work and a not-to-exceed price for performing the work (the final amount paid for the
work will be subject to itemized invoices for both time and materials, but will not exceed the amendment amount). The cost process will
culminate this summer with the establishment of the final GMPfor the project.
