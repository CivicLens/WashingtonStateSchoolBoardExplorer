a. Elanco Fundamentals of Animal Science Certificate Presentation: Mr. Hazen: Jazmine Chavez
worked very hard and put a lot of effort into completing the 120-day curriculum in just a couple of weeks
to earn the Elanco Fundamentals of Animal Science certificate. He read the official letter that came with
the certificate. This certificate will be beneficial for Jazmine when she applies to college or for a job in an
animal sciences field. Jazmine shared that she is interested in attending WSU and becoming a
veterinarian. Everyone was pleased and congratulated her.

5. NEW BUSINESS
a. TBIP Grant 2024-2025: Mark: TBIP, Transitional Bilingual Instructional Program, supports our
bilingual program and future dual language program. A new RCW requires board approval for the grant
application. The legislature has given districts a three-year window to implement a dual-language
program and board approval validates that the funds from this grant can be used for that purpose. Cindy
moved, Carlos 2nd to approve the TBIP Grant 2024-2025; motion passed

b. Budget Status /Enrollment and Operations Report: Francis: We are still closing the end of last
school year and will have a final report in November. Preliminary numbers look pretty good, the fund
balance might be a bit above where we ended a year ago. Will have discussion about how to use the Fund
Balance going forward. Enrollment is not so good. 4th grade is up but the overall first head count for this
school year was 989, it is the first time falling that low, below 1,000. The FTE came in at 967 about 35
fewer than we planned for at 1,002. In the past we have always budgeted for less than anticipated which
helps our fund balance at the end of the year but we’re seeing a new [downward] trend that will obviously
impact how we plan for next year that we’ll have to watch carefully. We could get more students but the
norm is for it to go up and down but not increase significantly. The decrease in student enrollment isn’t a
result of students transferring out but simply a decrease in enrollment. We are tracking and following the
enrollment and budgeting and sharing it with the union groups, admin, and advisory groups so they are
aware of it as we continue being intentional with our spending and planning.
c. Personnel Report: Mark: There is a correction in the August Personnel Report, an omitted
appointment of a long-term sub covering a teacher’s leave. The September report has a para resignation,
Brenda Castellanos and a family leave request for Makize Hernandez. We have a lot of 4th grade students
so after looking at funding (program and basic ed) it was decided to post for a third 4th grade teacher. It is
a challenging age group and having three teachers (reducing class size) will be the best for them. We will
communicate with parents about the change and plan to have it in place by early October, so the students
have a week in their new configuration of classes before conferences. We still have the posting for an
SLP. The extracurricular has a lot of placements for fall sports and HS advisors. Carlos moved, Cindy 2nd
to approve the corrected August 20, 2024 Personnel Report and the September 17, 2024 Personnel Report
as presented; motion carried.
d. Legislative Report: Cindy: No report this month.
e. Payment of Bills-General, ASB, Capital Projects, and Payroll: Carlos moved to pay the General
Fund, ASB, Capital Projects, and Payroll as presented, Cindy 2nd; motion passed.
