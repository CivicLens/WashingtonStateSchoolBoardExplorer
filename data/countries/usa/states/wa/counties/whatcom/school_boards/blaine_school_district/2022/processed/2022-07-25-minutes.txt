  3. Public Hearing
A. Public Hearing on 2022-23 Budget
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided a review of the proposed budget, including an explanation of each fund, information about significant changes, enrollment considerations, the four-year estimate, and the mandated MSOC disclosure. Determining the budgeted enrollment was explained, as well as expenditures from the General Fund related to new lease/software accounting standards mandated by the state. There was discussion throughout the hearing of consideration given in budget development to inflationary food and fuel costs as well as anticipated revenue shortfalls. Ms. Porter explained the district's intent to closely scrutinize expenditures in the coming year to determine how best to adjust the 2023-24 budget for better alignment with enrollment.
  There was extensive discussion regarding the four-year forecast which showed significant budget deficits in future years. Ms. Porter explained that the district would not, and could not, adopt a budget with deficits in the future. She further explained the benefit of reviewing the four-year forecast to ensure adjustments are made to avoid the projected deficits.

Director Creydt asked for confirmation that the funds earmarked for the purchase of Birch Bay property were included in the Capital Projects Fund projected expenditures. Ms. Porter explained that the Capital Projects Fund and the Transportation Fund are similarly structured to pay out all allowed expenditures, including the purchase of Birch Bay property.

Director Nunamaker asked for more detail regarding the increased expenditures and Ms. Porter explained anticipated increases in personnel and MSOC costs.

Director Leu asked about the revenue for each school's ASB fund, and discussion followed. ASB funds receive revenue from fundraising, ticket sales, etc. and do not receive any apportionment revenue. Director Leu also asked about inflationary considerations and about the district's limited benefit from increased property taxes. Ms. Porter clarified how property tax revenue is dispersed, with most of the funds going to the state.

Director Creydt asked whose role it is to decide where future budget cuts are made, and discussion followed regarding the collaborative process for considering budget adjustments.
  President Thomas commented on the intentional measures that the district's leadership has been making to build up the fund balance over the past two years in order to maintain programming through the current period. He then suggested postponing additional board discussion until the action item.
  At 8:01 p.m., President Thomas called for comments or questions from the public. Natalie Chavez commented on the impending expiration of enrollment stabilization funding and encouraged the board to consider, before those funds expire, ways to restore parents' faith in the district in order for them to send their students back to Blaine schools.

President Thomas closed the hearing at 8:04 p.m.
  4. Reports
A. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of June which included a debt service interest payment. Because stimulus funding has not yet been received, percent of budget for both revenues and expenditures are not comparable. Ms. Porter informed the board that she expects to provide the final 2021-22 fiscal year financial report in September after all remaining activity is processed. There were no additional questions regarding June's financial report.
  B. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
He expressed appreciation to Amber Porter, Christine Anderson in Human Resources, and to the district's administrators for the significant work over the past several months that went into developing the proposed 2022-23 budget.
In order to begin preparations for the new school year, Dr. Granger hopes that new COVID guidance will be provided in a Department of Health meeting on July 28.
  Director Creydt spoke up in reference to Ms. Chavez' comments related to public relations and asked about parent volunteers. Discussion followed regarding the district's challenge with managing the vaccine mandate for volunteers, and Director Creydt expressed concern that the district's public relations are negatively impacted by not allowing volunteers as other districts do. President Thomas indicated that he has been hearing positive comments resulting from the district's recent public relations efforts to celebrate good news in the district.
  Dr. Granger continued with the presentation of his report.
WSSDA legislative initiatives were reviewed and include those relating to funding.
In response to HB 1295 - Students Released from Institutional Education Facilities, Procedure 2402P will be updated with language to allow the granting of credit for passing a general education development test.
Procedure 3520P will also be updated to clarify that fees paid prior to applying for the Free and Reduced Lunch program cannot be reimbursed retroactively if the student applies, and is approved, for the Free and Reduced Lunch program later.
The InTouch receipting program offers families increased options for collecting payments for meals as well as for other charges.
Preparations are underway in anticipation of the board's attendance at the WSSDA conference in November.

President Thomas called for any further discussion. Director Creydt expressed concern related to the revenue and expenditure discrepancy, and discussion followed. Dr. Granger commended Ms. Porter for projecting a transparent four-year budget prediction which identifies clearly the need for adjustments in future years to balance the budget. Discussion continued, and President Thomas reminded the board that this issue has been on the horizon for the past two years and the impact of the district's reduced revenue has been delayed through conservative spending and the receipt of federal stimulus money.

There was clarifying discussion regarding the board's consideration of the four-year budget projection which is intended as a planning tool and not intended to authorize a future budget deficit. Director Leu acknowledged and appreciated the transparency of the four-year budget projection.

The board voted to approve adoption of the 2022-2023 Budget, including the four-year forecast, as presented by Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter in Resolution 2122-12.
