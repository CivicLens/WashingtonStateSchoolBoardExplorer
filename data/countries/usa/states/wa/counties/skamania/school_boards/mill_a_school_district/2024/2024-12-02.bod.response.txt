Board of Directors District Policies Agendas & Minutes Our Board Board Meeting Recordings About Our School Board. The Mill A School District Board of Directors is made up of 5 elected, volunteer community members who are dedicated to the advancement of students, staff and district goals. The most important responsibility of any school board is to work with their communities to improve student achievement in their local public schools. School boards derive their power and authority from the state. In compliance with state and federal laws, school boards establish policies and regulations by which their local schools are governed. The school board is responsible for: employing the superintendent developing and adopting policies, curriculum, and the budget; overseeing facilities issues; and adopting collective bargaining agreements. Regular Board Meetings Regular board meetings are held 6:00-7:30 PM on the third Monday or first non-holiday Monday after the 10th of the month in the Mid Reeves Library at Mill A School. Board Meetings are an important part of the functionality and transparency of the board to the community. Public attendance and comment is welcome and a regularly scheduled part of all board meetings. District Policies District Policies are the "rules" by which our school operates, they are constantly reviewed and modified as the Board deems necessary for the smooth operation of the school. All current Mill A School District policies are kept in the district office and are available to the public upon request during office hours, but will soon be fully accessible online.
