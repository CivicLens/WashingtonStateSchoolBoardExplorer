2.3 Resolution 26-24, Certification of 2025 Excess
Property Taxes

Meeting :

Nov 14, 2024 - Regular Board Meeting and Study
Session

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached resolution in connection with
excess property taxes. As superintendent, I have
reviewed and approve this item.

Public Content
Staff Contact:Kathryn Weilage, Chief Financial Officer
Explanation of Issue:
Resolution 26-24 certifies the districts levy collections for calendar year 2025 to Whatcom County. This adjusts the local levy to the lower of
the levy authority as providedby voters and the officially calculated levy lid. Under law, the board of directors is required to certify the levy
amount to the assessor by November 30.

At the February 13, 2024 election, the voters of Bellingham passed a General Fund Educational Support and Operations Excess Levy in the
amount of $37,000,000 for collection in calendar year 2025. Recent changes in the laws regarding imposition of local tax levies and use of
local revenues have limited the amount of money that may be collected by school districts in the form of local levies for general operational
purposes.

During the budget process, we estimated the levy collection for 2025 at $36,250,000. Using the state's formula, the district is eligible to
receive $2,500 per pupil, adjusted for inflation annually since 2020. The district is allowed to certify up to the amount authorized by voters,
which may be adjusted to the amount calculated under state law by the county before collection. Accordingly, we are requesting that the
board roll back the $37,000,000 approved by voters and certify the officially calculated levy lid of $36,176,425, plus adjustment for

administrative refunds. The debt service and capital projects levy certifications reflect voter authorizations plus adjustment for administrative
refund amounts that are collectible by the district by law; these amounts are advised by Whatcom County.

Consent
