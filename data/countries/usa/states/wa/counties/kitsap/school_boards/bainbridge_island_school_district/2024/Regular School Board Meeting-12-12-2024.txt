RE: Update on Communications & Strategic Communications Plan for 2024-25
__________________________________________
Bainbridge Island School District is committed to open, honest and ongoing communication with staff, families and the greater
community. Effective two-way communication helps establish and strengthen relationships and positive relationships are
essential for a strong school system.
In the Fall of 2022, BISD underwent a Communications Audit implemented by the National School Public Relations Association.
The audit examined BISD'scommunication efforts, assessed their effectiveness and provided customized recommendations to
enhance BISD communication practices. The audit's final report included eight recommendations and corresponding action
steps. Recognizing that implementing the recommendations takes time, effort and financial resources, BISD is focusing on the
following four goals for 2024-25.
Goal 1: Strengthen Trust:
Stakeholders will view district-level communications as trustworthy, transparent and timely.
Goal 2: Staff members understand their roles in achieving BISDs mission
Staff will feel valued, appreciated and essential to the success of BISD.
Goal 3: Increase knowledge of BISDs finances
Constituents will better understand district finances, how BISD is funded and the financial challenges the district faces.
Goal 4: Increase adoption of ParentSquare
Staff and families will view ParentSquare as a resource and the central location for communication.
At the Board Meeting, I will provide an update on progress made on the 2023-24 goals and provide an overview of the 2024-25
goals.
I respectfully request the board of directors approve the 2024-25 Strategic Communications Plan.

Re: Interfund Loan Resolution
____________________________________________________________________________
I am submitting for Board approval Resolution No. 01-24-25, authorizing loans from the Capital Projects Fund to the General
Fund to alleviate cash flow deficiencies in the 2024-2025 fiscal year.
As recommended by the fiscal team at Puget Sound Educational Service District, such loans would be taken in increments as
necessary to meet payroll and accounts payable obligations, not to exceed $5.4M in the aggregate. The first loan is anticipated
to be taken this month with interest calculated at the prevailing rate established by the Kitsap County Treasurer.
The District will continue to collaborate with PSESD to determine the earliest possible repayment dates for any loans initiated.

Re: Policy 3420 Anaphylaxis Prevention & Response - First Reading
________________________________________________________

I am bringing forward a revision to Policy 3420: Anaphylaxis Prevention and Response. WSSDA revised their policy and
procedure this fall based on House Bill 1608 - Expanding access to anaphylaxis medications in schools. This legislation requires
the secretary of health or the secretary of healths designee to issue a statewide standing order prescribing epinephrine and
epinephrine autoinjectors to any school district or school for use by a school nurse or other designated trained school personnel.
With this change in policy, in the event a student with a current prescription for an epinephrine auto injector for a previously
diagnosed life-threatening allergy on file at the school experiences an anaphylactic event, the school nurse or designated trained
school personnel may use the school supply of epinephrine auto injectors to respond if the students supply is not immediately
available. Additionally, in the event a school nurse is available and determines that an individual without a prescription for an
epinephrine auto injector is displaying the symptoms of anaphylaxis, the school nurse may utilize the school supply of
epinephrine to respond under the standing order protocol.
I recommend approval of Policy 3420: Anaphylaxis Prevention and Response First Reading
