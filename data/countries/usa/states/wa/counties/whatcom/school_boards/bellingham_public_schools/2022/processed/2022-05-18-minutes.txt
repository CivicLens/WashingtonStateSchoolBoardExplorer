OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
May 18, 2022 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Bashaw called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw
(President), Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler, Jenn Mason, Katie Rose,
Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
Because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19, public participation is
limited to written submissions only, and all written comments received will be shared
with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all messages received.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
Dr. Baker acknowledged that there are several attendees this evening who have submitted
letters regarding construction projects. Each board member has seen all submissions, but
that will not be a point of discussion by the board this evening.
The rate of COVID-19 cases around the district, county and country have risen. It is
projected that we will continue to see cases, and our district will continue to follow the
guidance of the health department.
We are finalizing our budget plans for the 2022-23 school year. The state legislature
finished its work earlier this year, and they have earmarked funds in some key categories:
rebranding work for schools retiring Indigenous mascots, which is what we have done at
Bellingham High School; nurses and mental health staff; enrollment stabilization; and
cost of living salary increases for staff. To cover the salary increase, we need to
redistribute funds from our local levy. Class sizes are returning to pre-pandemic levels;
our high school library media specialists and instructional coaches are going to each
teach one class, and we are not filling some vacant positions through attrition. We plan to
invest in middle school campus monitors, an elementary intervention team and expand
AVID and International Baccalaureate (IB) among other things. Dr. Baker responded to
questions from the board and noted that a formal proposal for adoption of the 2022-23
budget will come to the board in July or August.
Staff appreciation week was May 2-6, and Dr. Baker shared some of the ways that staff
were recognized.

The celebration was attended by former students and staff, as well as current families and

last week was a very powerful event.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
Annual Affirmative Action Progress Report – no action needed.
GP-7.2 – 2021-22 Annual Board Agenda, Revised – general review.
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Mason thought the Latinx community linkage at Shuksan Middle School last
week was amazing. She thanked Executive Director of Family Engagement Isabel
Meaker and everyone who worked to put that evening together. She found it to be
thoughtful, intentional and informative. A parent at Ms. Mason’s table had shared
about the difficulties she encountered when she moved to the United States, and Ms.
Mason wishes there were more mental health services available to parents. She also
enjoyed the board’s visit to Carl Cozier Elementary, to see and hear their theory in
action. The work around inclusion has been incredible.
• Mr. Benjamin thanked Dr. Baker for his report this evening. He agrees with Ms.
Mason’s comments about the Latinx community linkage. He admitted that he is not
brought to tears easily but was very touched by the presentation and the thank you
notes that were provided to board members. The data from Dr. Veronica Vélez and
the parent panel were amazing, and he encouraged the district to submit the
presentation to WSSDA for their annual conference in November. It was great to be
back at Carl Cozier Elementary for the recent school board visit. He reminded the
board of the WSSDA Director Area 1 meeting in Anacortes on May 24 and hopes his
fellow board members will be able to join him there.
• Ms. Rose echoed what Ms. Mason and Mr. Benjamin reported about the Latinx
community linkage and the Carl Cozier visit. She learned so much at the linkage and

the food was great. Raising the expertise of the community has been a huge part of
that work. A parent seated at her table had shared how impactful and valuable the
work of the family engagement team has been in bringing a sense of community into
the school. She was impressed learning at the Carl Cozier school board visit how
powerful it is to have connections in place to support students and families.
Ms. Diaz Hackler apologized for not attending last week’s school board linkage. She
noted that land may stay stable, but the borders we create can move. She shared that
Ms. Meaker has been a great resource to the Bellingham Public Schools community
and for her own family, and she cherishes her as a counselor and friend. She also
enjoyed the visit to Carl Cozier and is excited for students and staff there to receive a
new school.
Ms. Bashaw enjoyed the Carl Cozier visit, where her children attended elementary
school. The visit was powerful, and she was impressed with the passion of the staff
and is hopeful about the new model of inclusion. She thanked Ms. Meaker, her staff
and Dr. Vélez for the Latinx community linkage. She was blown away by the food,
and the conversations at her table were powerful.
Dr. Baker asked that Ms. Meaker come forward, and she joined and talked about how
families are now staying longer in our schools, or will leave and return, largely due to
the amount of support they receive here. Ms. Meaker appreciates the support of the
school board. She shared that Ricardo Sanchez, a parent who addressed the board at
the linkage meeting, is appreciative of Dr. Baker and other leaders in the school
district who work in service to the community.

CDH:
• The board is impressed with the Promise K growth. More children will benefit from such a
great program.
• The board is pleased with efforts so far towards maintaining good mental health for students.
We would like to encourage more efforts, especially since there are probably problems that
are not yet fully realized.
JM:
• Broadening work with UW around inclusive education in our District.
• Implementation of new early literacy intervention program.
• Expanded efforts around mental health, including adding a second mental health specialist.
• Continued expansion of CTE classes, which has already been an area of huge growth.
• Expansion of the IB program.
• Implementation of common high school grading practices, an effort that has great potential to
eliminate confusion, streamline standards, and address inequities.
• Great response to the unique needs for families that came about during the pandemic,
including growth through the BVL program, BFPP, and technology solutions.
KR:
● Task force to explore dual language programs has exciting potential for a new way to
continue to strengthen home-school connections.
● Valuable partnerships with UW to provide quality professional development around inclusive
practices.

leverage skills and resources within elementary schools.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KB:
• None.
DB:
• None.
CDH:
• Assistive technology – this is both an acknowledgment of progress made and a question if all
students are being served that need assistance. Having a child in Special Ed always made me
wonder if there was more that we could do at home to help maintain progress. Especially over
breaks. It makes me wonder if families have access to tools and if they have to ask or how
that works.
JM:
• None.

Adapting and responding to the additional, unique needs of students coming back to school in
Fall 2021 (with respect to the pandemic), including shifting schedules to allow for more
planning, deploying instructional coaches, and having “all hands-on deck” to cover staff
shortages due to illness
The Family Engagement Team once again shows how critical they are to the backbone of our
District and family wellness. The work of this team to meet student/family needs is a really
strong point for this District and something to be proud of.
Continued work to engage our Latinx community, particularly in recognizing the deep and
often disproportionate ways these families have been impacted by COVID.
Lots of prompt and clear communication done around inclement weather/calendar changes.
Appreciate the willingness to adapt to the pandemic impacts, including postponing projects,
providing more family engagement time, and teaching and learning staff stepping in to help
with absences.
Vaccination clinics and testing were a wonderful way to support families and provide new,
unexpected engagement opportunities.
Testing, vaccination, refugee support, Latinx community engagement, and support for
families through FRC highlights not just how deeply students’ ability to learn and thrive is
impacted by the community but also how deeply important public schools are to our
community as a whole.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KB:
• None.
DB:
• None.
CDH:
• The one thing I wonder about is finding the last day of school, late in the school year, in all
languages. With inclement weather changes and COVID changes, I tried searching and only
came up with the original version that was published at the beginning of the year. Perhaps my
Spanish isn’t good enough to look properly.
JM:
• None.
4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Appreciate the links to show all of the great work that the District is doing to support our
students and families.
DB:
• Appreciate the clear distinction of new items from the routine.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
Students involved in CTE had a 90% graduation rate. The difference between low income and
non-low-income students who are in the Asian and Hispanic/Latinx group vary greatly at 98%
above their low-income peers.
There is evidence that overall graduation rates continue to improve, the impact of the pandemic
notwithstanding. Greater progress has been made with Latinx, free and reduced lunch and IEP
students.
It is encouraging to see the rate of students with an IEP engage in post-secondary opportunities,
particularly compared to others across the State.
Despite being a small cohort, 100% of Black/African American students graduated from the class
of 2020.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
Continue to work with our partners to increase FAFSA/WASFA completion rates.

Date Report Submitted: 3/16/2022
Date of Board’s Monitoring Response: 4/20/2022
As noted in the report, we still have more to accomplish in compensating for the impacts of race,
language and socio-economic factors on graduation.
Continued improvement to close gaps in graduation rates, particularly for students with low
incomes, while also recognizing the significant work that has happened in this area, with success.
4. Comments on the report itself.
The report has a remarkable depth of data, clearly a great deal of work has gone into the analysis.
Appreciated seeing the individual student comments, this gives a nuance statistical data cannot.
COVID has had such an impact, in ways we don’t completely understand yet; appreciate pointing
out where there looks to be a trend vs. acute shift.
5. Possible changes to the policy.
“All students will succeed and grow regardless of ethnicity, socio-economic status, English
language proficiency or disabilities.”
In light of more recent EDI efforts and the broadening of inclusion, should this language be
expanded to include other identified groups such as LGBTQ+ for example?
Is there a grammatical problem with 4? Or a missing word?
