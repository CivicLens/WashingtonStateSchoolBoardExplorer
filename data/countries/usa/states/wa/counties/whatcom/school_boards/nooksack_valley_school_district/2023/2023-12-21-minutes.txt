Mark Olson shared the following about his 28 years of service on the board, with this being his
final meeting: “28 years went very fast and overall, it was easy. We had great leadership from
Mark Johnson and now Matt Galley, Steve and Randy were great chairmen, and Cheryl was a
great legislative representative. If we continue to focus on academics and what is best for kids,
we will maintain strong support from the community. With new members, all great, and good
quality people, the district is in good hands.”

•

Cheryl Thornton shared the following about her 28 years of service on the board: “I’ve attended
approximately 330 meetings in 28 years. There were some challenges, but they were mostly
smooth. We went through so many years with very few guests. Now we truly appreciate the
guests and the feedback we get. I was part of the graduations of 3 of our new board members. I
wanted to go out feeling good about our work. I want my lasting message to be one of
positivity, not scarcity, and keep that message strong.”

•

Steve Jones then thanked both Mark and Cheryl for their service and devoting much of their
lives to the district. “We’ve set a standard. On behalf of the community, thank you both.”
