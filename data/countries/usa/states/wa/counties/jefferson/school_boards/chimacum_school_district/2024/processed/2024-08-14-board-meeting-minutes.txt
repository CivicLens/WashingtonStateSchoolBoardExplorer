and Flex Learning room constructions.
Superintendent Report
Dr. Mauk presented an update on the Finance Director position. He welcomed our new Executive
Director of Business and Finance, Kelly Liske. Dr. Mauk explained that the transition has been going well
and the new director is easing into the roll as she learns the lay of the land.
Legislative Priorities
The board discussed what legislative priorities they should focus on for the 2025 Legislative session.
They discussed how we can tell the Chimacum story. Some important items they wanted to focus on
were Education Funding, Special Education, Safety Net, and Technology. The directors were also
concerned about the paperwork burden that falls on a small school district where the staff is stretched
so thin.
They will be discussing these issues with our representatives who will be attending the JECP meeting in
September in CSD.

course of action. The board agreed at least one of the board members will be attending the in-person
community advisory meeting held by the Transit Authority.

Director Kathryn Lamka presented an update on the Farm to School Institute Conference and the work
