3. Public Comment
Subject :

A. Public Comment Guidelines - We welcome and appreciate
hearing from our citizens regarding issues of personal or
public interest. The board requires those who wish to speak
(but not all attendees) to sign in so that the board has a tally of
individuals who wish to speak and can call them forward.
When called forward, individuals will identify themselves ans
proceed to make comments, limited to 3 minutes per person,
time may not be deferred during the public meeting and should
be presented respectfully. The board is not obligated to
respond to questions or challenges made during the public
comment period and the board's silence will not signal
agreement or endorsement of the speaker's remarks. The
board may control the time, place, and manner of public
comment. The chair may terminate an individual's statement
when the allotted time has passed and may interrupt a
speaker to require the same standard of civilty that the board
imposes on itself.

Public Content
Board of Education Policy 1410 addresses the convening of an Executive Session.
EXECUTIVE OR CLOSED SESSIONS
Before convening in executive session, the chairperson shall publicly announce the general purpose for
excluding the public from the meeting place and the time when the executive session will be concluded.
The executive session may be extended to a stated later time by announcement of the chairperson.

An executive session may be conducted for one or more of the following purposes:
A. To consider the selection of a site or the acquisition of real estate by lease or purchase when public
knowledge regarding such consideration would cause a likelihood of increased price;
B. To consider the minimum price at which real estate will be offered for sale or lease when public
knowledge regarding such consideration would cause a likelihood of decreased price; however, the final
action of selling or leasing public property shall be taken in a meeting open to the public;
C. To review negotiations on the performance of publicly-bid contracts when public knowledge regarding
such consideration would cause a likelihood of increased costs;
D. To receive and evaluate complaints or charges brought against a director or staff member; however,
upon the request of such director or staff member, a public hearing or a meeting open to the public shall
be conducted on such complaint or charge;
E. To evaluate the qualifications of an applicant for public employment or to review the performance of a
staff member; however, discussion of salaries, wages, and other conditions of employment to be generally
applied within the district shall occur in a meeting open to the public, and when the board of directors
elects to take the final action of hiring, setting the salary of an individual staff member or class of staff
members, or discharging or disciplining an employee, that action shall be taken in a meeting open to the
public;
F. To evaluate the qualifications of a candidate for appointment to the board of directors; however, any
interview of such candidate and final action appointing a candidate to the board of directors shall be in a
meeting open to the public; or
G. To discuss with legal counsel representing the district matters relating to district enforcement actions,
or litigation or potential litigation to which the district, the board of directors, or a member acting in an
official capacity is, or is likely to become, a party, when public knowledge regarding the discussion is
likely to result in an adverse legal or financial consequence to the district. Potential litigation means
matters protected by attorney-client privilege related to litigation that has been specifically threatened;
litigation that the district reasonably believes may be commenced; or the litigation or legal risks of a
proposed action or current practice of the district, if public discussion is likely to result in an adverse or
financial consequence to the district.
