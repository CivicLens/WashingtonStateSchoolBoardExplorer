Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director of Capital Projects and School Facilities

Explanation of Issue:
As part of the bond approved by voters on February 13, 2018, an auxiliary gym will be constructed at Shuksan Middle School.
RCW 39.80.040 governs the process for selecting architects. One option is to select a firm from an annual general request for statements of
qualifications from firms interested in providing such services.
After reviewing the statements of qualifications from firms who responded to our annual request, I believe Zervas Group Architects is best
qualified to provide services for the Shuksan Middle School Auxiliary Gym Project. Zervas provided architectural services for the construction
of the new Shuksan Middle School which opened in 2009. Zervas is most familiar with the existing site and all building systems which will
allow for a more efficient and economical design process for the auxiliary gym.

I am seeking your approval to begin contract negotiations with Zervas Group Architects for services related to the Shuksan Middle School
Auxiliary Gym Project.

Consent
Our adopted rules of Parliamentary Procedure, Robert's Rules, provide for a consent agenda listing
several items for approval of the Board by a single motion. Documentation concerning these items has
been provided to all Board members and the public in advance to ensure an extensive and thorough
review. Any item which appears on the consent agenda may be removed by majority vote of the board
and placed on the regular agenda.
