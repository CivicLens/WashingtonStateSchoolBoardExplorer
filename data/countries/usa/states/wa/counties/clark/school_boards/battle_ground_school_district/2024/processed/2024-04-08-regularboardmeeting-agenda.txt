Per Policy 2320, student travel requests require board approval if they are overnight trips. Advisors are required to submit all

Advisors must clear the trip with their building principal prior to submitting the request to Risk Management. Advisors are

and information on the group of students traveling with chaperones.
Exceptions to the rule are travel requests for state and national tournaments and competitions. The procedures for these types of

approval. The trip is then ratified by board members at their next regularly scheduled board meeting.
Student travel requests are attached.

Assistant Director of AWARE
Background:
On Oct. 25, 2023, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) awarded
the Project Advancing Wellness and Resilience in Education (Project AWARE) grant to the district. Of
the 21 organizations selected for the grant nationwide, the district was the only school district in
Washington State to receive $5 million that will be administered over a five-year period. As a result, the
Board, in February, approved advertising a request for proposal for necessary program evaluation
services. The evaluator is to assess the ongoing status of the grant by providing timely information for
creating strategic plans, assessing disparities or gaps in service, measuring progress, and keeping the
project focused on the overall objectives.
The District advertised in both the Washington and Oregon Daily Journal of Commerce newspapers as
well as on the District and the WA State Office of Minority & Womens Business Enterprise (OMWBE)
webpages. Thirty-seven companies requested the proposal packet. Proposals were accepted until
3:00 pm and opened publicly on March 13, 2024. Eight companies submitted proposals by the deadline.
In addition, one proposal arrived late, and was returned to the vendor unopened.
A committee was formed to review each proposal based on the criteria as outlined in the RFP. A
summary of the combined average score of the committee members for each proposal is attached.
Bids were scored by category; 100 total points were available.
CATEGORY POINTS
Experience in qualitative & quantitative data collection & analysis 20
Experience with federal grant data systems 20
Experience in evaluating programs for youth and families 20
Experience with culturally competent evaluation practices 20
Cost 20
The committee reached a unanimous decision to recommend the award of the Project AWARE Program
Evaluation Services contract 2324-02 to The Osborne Collaborative.
The initial term of the contract will end September 29, 2025; with an option to renew for up to three (3)
additional twelve-month periods, with the final term ending September 29, 2028. The contract will be
funded by the AWARE grant proceeds through SAMHSA. Annual continuation awards will depend on the

availability of grant funds, District progress in meeting project goals and objectives, timely submission of
required data and reports, and compliance with all terms and conditions of the award. The option to extend
any contract resulting from this procurement shall be at the sole discretion of the District.
The contract was added to Public Content at 10:14am by L. Randle. The contract was initially put under Executive Content by
mistake.
