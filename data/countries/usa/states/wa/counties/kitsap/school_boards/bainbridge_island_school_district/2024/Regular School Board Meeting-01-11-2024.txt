Re: Removal of Policy 5015 Prohibition of Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying
____________________________________________________________________________________
I recommend removal of policy 5015, Prohibition of Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying. This
policy was adopted in 1999 and last revised in 2008. This policy is not a listed policy by the
Washington School Directors Association (WSSDA).
The Bainbridge Island School District has adopted policies 5010, Nondiscrimination and
Affirmative Action and 5011, Sexual Harassment of District Staff Prohibited in 2013 and 2015
respectively. Both policies are based on WSSDA model policy and provide guidance and
procedures for staff members who may face discrimination and/or sexual harassment. The
continuation of policy 5015 has proven redundant and confusing for staff and supervisors.
This memo is in regards to the removal of policy 5015, Prohibition of Harassment, Intimidation
and Bullying, and I recommend the board remove this policy.
