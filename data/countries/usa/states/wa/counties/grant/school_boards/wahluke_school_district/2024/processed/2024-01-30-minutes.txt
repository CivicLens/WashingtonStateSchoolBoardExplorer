Budget:

Why: enrollment down, NOV levy failure, additional 2024-25 cuts
2024-25 Planning
Forecast: regionally & statewide things will be tough
Must fix staff mix -or- use Mabton model
Reserves, binding conditions, early apportionments
We’ll have 6-8 more staff cuts + pass levy
Begin Capital planning for 1, 3, 5, 10 years

Capital Project Levy
Clarifications
Could mean possible cuts
Excited for next 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 years
Next Steps
Focus on “Yes” votes, not DA “No’s”
Matchback and 50 votes
Wahluke Challenge
Staff not living in community -or -able to vote

K-5 Reconfiguration “WHY’s”...
Our “Why’s” a decade ago weren’t student first: Superintendent & OSPI
Decreased Student Data over last 10 years
Challenges: not same test + Pre-COVID & Post COVID
Equity:
How Kinder students are placed?
Access to resources and opportunities
Strategic Plan: strengthening our PLC’s across grade levels
Sharing our very limited resources
No other district in region breaks-up valuable resources up like WSD
Target needs

Honor EMT’s, driver, students at HT of playoff basketball game
