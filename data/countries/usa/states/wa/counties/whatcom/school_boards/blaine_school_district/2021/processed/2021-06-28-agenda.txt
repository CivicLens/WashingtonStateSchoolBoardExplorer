These policies,relating to the professional conduct of district staff members, are being updated pursuant
to WSSDA recommendations and to align with current district practice. Language addressing processes
regulated by state statute and collective bargaining agreements has been stricken. To avoid confusion

been deleted. Procedural language that is still relevant for Blaine School District has been merged into
the corresponding policy (highlighted in blue). The board had an opportunity to review and discuss these
updates at the May meeting, and is now asked to approve "Second Reading" and adoption of updates to
the following policies:
Policy 5006: Certification Revocation
