  MEETING EVALUATION SURVEY
12.01 School Board Evaluation of the Meeting
Mr. Ledbetter mentioned that the agenda seems to always be long.  He went on to say, with Ms. Gonzales in agreement, that kids have suffered a lot in the past couple of years and the education system has not adjusted properly.  The capacity of kids to do work is just not the same as it was. The board talks about compliant or non-compliant on this or that subject, but there are more factors the we need to consider.  We need to focus on certain agenda items so that we can continue to make positive decisions for students.
