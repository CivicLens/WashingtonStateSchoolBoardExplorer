3. Good News
For the Be The One Mentoring Program, there were 114 mentoring pairs at the end of the school year between LMS and LHS.
This exceeds our previous record by at least 16 pairs. Volunteers are continually stepping up to help students. They exceeded
over 1,600 mentoring hours this year.
The LHS Impact Club hosted a Bingo night for the Lynden Middle School ELRC students. This was the last of several Bingo nights
they hosted this year. The middle school students have a great time seeing the high school campus and getting to know high
school staff while they play Bingo and eat pizza together!
All schools and departments celebrated achievements of students and the completion of the school year over the past few
weeks. There is tremendous appreciation for the planners and doers that make these experiences happen.
Elementary schools hosted their annual Family Fun Night events to celebrate the end of the year. Our elementary PTA groups
work hard to coordinate this event for their schools and this year was no exception. A great time was had by all who attended
and parents enjoyed being able to celebrate with their students!
