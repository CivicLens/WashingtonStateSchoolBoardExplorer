Highland School District #203
District Office
Monday, April 8, 2024
Regular Board Meeting-7:00 a.m.
The April 8, 2024, AM Regular Board Meeting convened at 7:05 a.m. Present included Board members
David Barnes, Nikki Keller, and Cindy Reed, Superintendent Mark Anderson, Director of Student Success
Mindy Schultz, and Recording Secretary Julie Notman. Board members Lupita Flores and Carlos López
were absent.
1. Communication Check-In: It has been quiet as the last two weeks were conferences followed by
Spring Break. The new website will not go live until the summer as the new company did not load
everything from the old website as promised.
2. Out-of-State/Overnight Travel Request-HS Band: This is their annual trip to participate in the
Lilac Parade in Spokane, funded by their parent group. Cindy moved and David 2nd to approve the Outof-District/Overnight Travel Request by the HS Band; motion carried.
3. 2024-2025 Instructional Calendar: The first day of classes was never meant to be a half-day, it was
a color-coding error. Intersessions are proposed to be in February and May with the week of May
including two Snow Makeup Days at the end of the week. Thanksgiving week has the extended break
with only one and one-half days of class. This is not preferred by the board, [greater absenteeism is
expected] as there are a lot of breaks during that time of the year and it is not conducive to learning.
After discussion of the calendar overall, David moved and Cindy 2nd to adopt the 2024-2025
Instructional Calendar as presented; motion carried.
4. 1st Reading of New/Revised Policies: There were no questions about the policies: move them to
second reading at next board meeting.
Revised Policy:

3122 Excused & Unexcused Absences
3225 School-based Threat Assessment
3231 Student Records
3050 Contracts
6630 Driver Trainer and Responsibility

5. WSIF Presentation: WSIF stands for Washington State Improvement Framework and is the current
way OSPI is measuring student success and growth. Mindy shared Highland’s report via the OSPI
website, explaining what the numbers stand for and how we compare to area districts that have similar
student populations and programs. TES had growth in both EL and SpEd and is moving in the right
direction. HMS has made gains in EL but has been identified with one target area in SpEd. As the
student population moves up a grade level the results will shift and a very few number of students can
affect the scores. Per these results, we are doing better than other schools that are similar
[demographically] to HSD so we are quite pleased with where we are.
6. OSPI Assessment of District Student Health Services: Things have changed quite a bit for the
school nursing department. There are many more, and different, issues for which students need
assistance than in the past when we had only one district nurse and we need a way to support our current
district nurse this next school year and beyond. The part-time health room aide we have now is ESSER
funded which ends with this school year. The OSPI Assessment of District Student Health Services,
completed by the ESD 105 Nurse Corps head nurse and our district nurse, Amanda Baughman, resulted
in a calculation that shows we will need to continue to have a second, part-time health staff person to
meet student needs.
7. 2024-2025 Budget and Staffing Review: There have been no changes/improvements to our budget
situation and per the recommendation of HHS Principal Jeremy Gillespie, dated 2/8/24, to eliminate the

CTE Business/Marketing position to help with the budget shortfall, Cindy moved, with 2nd by David, to
approve said recommendation to eliminate the CTE Business/Marketing position; motion carried. The
non-renewed staff have received their official letters. Reviewed the RIF letter and discussed the appeal
process. The other department that needs attention is Special Education. Discussed options for staffing
that department with one less teacher [one had to be non-renewed due to budget constraints and the
reduction in enrollment]. Mark will meet with the remaining department staff later this week to discuss
staff placement.
8. Capital Project Update: This summer we must narrow down what the next project will be and set a
timeline to get it done. The track/football field is a top priority. Another high priority is to address our
declining enrollment and cut overhead by reducing buildings by combining PreK-5 in one. We might
start with trying to pass a bond to build a new Pre-K-5 building on the HHS/HMS/District Office
campus [sell the MWC and TES properties] and if that were to be unsuccessful, change to remodeling
TES. We need to review cash flow and consult a contractor to find out if remodeling is even viable.
There are two options for funding a remodel: wait until the funds come in from tax payments [would
take a few years] or borrow to complete the work sooner.
9. WSSDA Regional Meeting: We are hosting the WSSDA Regional meeting on Thursday, April 18 in
the HMS Commons. Cindy and Lupita are not available. David and Nikki committed to attend. Mindy
will prepare a short presentation for Mark to share.

Meeting adjourned at 8:52 a.m.
