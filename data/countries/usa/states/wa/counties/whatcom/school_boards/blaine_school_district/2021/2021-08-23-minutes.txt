Christie Aiello (virtual attendee) commented on her decision to withdrew her daughter because of the mask requirement. She expressed frustration at not receiving any response from the school board to concerns she expressed previously.
Dean Berkeley criticized the district for seeming to pick and choose what mandates it will follow. He referenced fees that were not refunded for canceled student trips in 2020.
Kristin Engen shared comments in support of staff who do not want the COVID vaccine.
Christie Peetoom asked the board to advocate on behalf of those who do not want the COVID vaccine.
Mylissa Bode asked the board to look for loopholes and to take a stand against the state's mask mandate. At the end of the comment period, Ms. Bode also implored the district to accept as many vaccine exemptions as possible.
Crissy Kuoppala commented on the government taking away freedoms from parents and children who should be able to choose for themselves if they want to wear a mask.
Julie Johner shared quotes from WSSDA's website regarding the school board's governing authority, and she commented that COVID is not a danger to kids.
Kristanie Ulrich, former Special Education teacher, described the circumstances of her departure under pressure from Blaine School District and expressed disappointment in not being able to participate in a smooth transition for her vulnerable students.
Jessi Bugbee, former Special Education teacher, explained her decision to leave Blaine School District to accept a full-time position elsewhere. She expressed disappointment in the High School AVID teaching position moving to full time after her time here.
Catherine Streeter compared her experience of staying healthy while teaching in person last year in Canadian schools with no masks compared to her children's struggle with learning online in Blaine schools.
Nazar Gamdysey described his perspective having been a religious refugee from USSR. He compared the current loss of freedoms in the United States with the events preceding the rise of Soviet power in Russia. He asked the board to be understanding about their concerns and their decision to withdraw their students because they do not want to wear masks.
David Spring shared comments regarding the authority of the US and Washington State Constitutions. He indicated that future levies would not be supported by patrons if the school board fails to exercise its local governing power. Mr. Spring also distributed a written memorandum in opposition of the mask mandate.
Jerry Vekved addressed concerns related to the district's instructional quality, curriculum content (sex ed and CRT), and restrictions on community use of facilities for youth sports.
Rebecca Wilson described how masks have impacted her own children and asked the board to fight for families' rights to choose whether to wear a mask.
Marilyn Martin requested that her husband, Robert Martin be added to the list of patrons wishing to address the board. She shared concerns regarding the COVID vaccine as well as comments about the potential impact of the state's vaccine mandate. Ms. Martin also commented on parents not being allowed to volunteer in schools and reminded the directors of their accountability to electors.
Robert Martin shared comments regarding critical thinking, inclusiveness, diversity, and tolerance. He will oppose future levies if schools require the COVID vaccine.
Ryan Swinburnson described the board's response as a "collective shrug" and offered suggestions for potential courses of action, including facilitation of an open forum with officials implementing mandates, advocating to state authorities, providing opportunities for monthly public discussion sessions to communicate the board's position on issues with the local community.
Natalie Chavez described the experimental COVID vaccine as a human rights violation and referenced examples of teenage deaths following the vaccine which are not publicized in the mainstream media. She provided the board with a packet of written materials in opposition of the COVID vaccine.
  Public comments concluded at 8:15 p.m. and the board took a short break until 8:28 p.m. when the meeting resumed.
  3. Public Hearing
A. Public Hearing on 2021-22 Budget
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided an explanation about the budget adoption process and the action being considered by the board at this meeting. An overview of the 2021-2022 Budget was provided. There was discussion regarding each fund as well as revenue sources. The district does not anticipate receiving ESSER funds beyond the current year, but intends to set aside current ESSER funding for possible future use. Ms. Porter confirmed that the ending 6% fund balance will be maintained. There was discussion regarding options to build the fund balance in order to offset unexpected future expenses. A special federal funding program will allow the district to provide all students with meals at no charge this year. Staffing is budgeted close to pre-pandemic levels. Ms. Porter explained that budgeted enrollment is based upon student cohort sizes in May 2021, but the possibility remains for continued enrollment decline which could result in the district falling below budgeted enrollment again this year. The district will lose certain LAP funding due to the lack of Free and Reduced Lunch participants last year. Fuel and supply chain challenges are anticipated, and the current legal climate further contributes to what Ms. Porter described as "a risky landscape". Ms. Porter shared information regarding the General Fund's 4-year forecast which projects how current program spending will play out over time. Although the forecasted budgets do not balance, actual future budgets must balance. President Gibson asked if a conflict is created by adopting a 4-year forecast that doesn't balance, and discussion followed regarding the purpose of the 4-year forecast. Discussion followed regarding the impact of lost apportionment revenue and programming. Ms. Porter referenced the mandatory MSOC disclosure information.

President Gibson called for comments or questions. Christie Peetoom asked about options for grants or other non-traditional funding, and Ms. Porter affirmed that the district has and will take advantage of any opportunity to receive grant funding for programming. Director McKinney added that the 4-year forecast gives an opportunity to look into additional funding options.

President Gibson closed the hearing at 9:00pm
  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Reports
There were no school administrator presentations at this meeting, and the directors had an opportunity in advance to review written reports from each school.
  B. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of July. There were no additional questions regarding July's financial report.
  C. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Preparations are underway in anticipation of welcoming all students to return to full-time in-person learning.
Certificated staff members will begin the year on Friday, August 27, and all staff members will return on Tuesday, August 31. Directors are welcome to attend the Welcome Back Launch event for staff in the stadium starting at 8:30 a.m.
School resumes for students on Wednesday, September 1.
In the last four days, enrollment has decreased by 18 FTE and the district continues to monitor the status of enrollment for the budget. The impact of low enrollment may result in the district pausing to fill leave requests.
Dr. Granger is continuing to work closely with the local health authority to maximize all methods for allowing students to continue in-person learning. A "Return to Learn" testing protocol will help by allowing for the return of asymptomatic unvaccinated students who are exposed to COVID-19 in school.
WSSDA has provided an updated set of 1000 series policies as the first installment in the district's Policy Manual review process. Each director will be provided with the full set of updated 1000 policies on a thumb drive and given a month to review the updates prior to first reading.
For the second year in a row, the district received good remarks on the annual DOT inspection. Dr. Granger commended the Transportation Department staff for doing an excellent job.
