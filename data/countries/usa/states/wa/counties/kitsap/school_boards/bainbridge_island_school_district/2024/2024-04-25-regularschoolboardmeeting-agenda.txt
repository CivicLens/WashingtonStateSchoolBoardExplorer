that we are no longer considering school closure or consolidation, and instead are back on track with the great work
happening in schools, each of our seven BISD schoolswill attend a board meeting this spring to highlight the amazing
experiences of their students and steadfast dedication and tremendous talent of their staff.

Re:Policy 3415 Accommodating Students with Diabetes -Second Reading
_________________________________________________________
Bainbridge Island School District has not yet adopted a policy specifically for the care of students with diabetes, although there
are clear practices for Individual Health Care Plans currently in place within our buildings that are monitored by the school
nurses. WSSDA (Washington State School Directors' Association) has a model policy, Policy 3415:Accommodating Students
With Diabetes, that is deemed essential and was last revised by WSSDA in December 2011. This policy was written in order to
be consistent with RCW28A.210.330(please see the board packet for this RCW), which provides guidance to school districts on
caring for students with diabetes, including the creation of Individual Health Care Plans, designation of a professional to consult
and coordinate with parents and the students health care provider, and training and supervision of school district personnel. This
policy has been reviewed with the registered nurse ESAs for input and is consistent with current BISD practices for caring for
students with diabetes.
I recommend approval of Policy 3415 Accommodating Students with Diabetes - Second Reading.

Re: Policy 3420 Anaphylaxis - Second Reading

_________________________________________________
I am bringing forward a revision to Policy 3420: Anaphylaxis Prevention and Response. WSSDA put out a model policy and
procedure in 2018, which largely included changes to the procedure that were in line with Policy 3419: Self-Administration of
Asthma and Anaphylaxis Medication which was approved earlier this year. Wording in this policy is changed slightly to clarify that
students can have an allergic reaction without a history of anaphylaxis and that the district will take precautions to reduce the risk
of exposure to allergens for students that do have a history of anaphylaxis. The WSSDA model policy submitted with the board
packet includes optional wording for districts that are stocking undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors, but at this time our
district is not stocking undesignated epinephrine in our health rooms.
I recommend approval of Policy 3420 Anaphylaxis Prevention and Response Second Reading

Re: Monthly Report on Technology Levy, Planning and Projects

Technology Levy Budget Summary
This is a summary of the 2023/2024 technology levy budget. This summary provides information on the total encumbrances
(outstanding and paid) applied to the 2023/2024 fiscal school year. The 2023/2024 technology levy budget is supported by
collections from 2021 BISD technology levies.
SY 2023/2024Technology Levy Budget Capacity
Encumbered To Date (Commitment to Pay when Invoiced)
Variance (Est. Remaining Encumbered Budget Capacity)

$ 2,866,770.00
$ 1,807,136.84

$ 2,866,770.00
$ 1,779,709.23
$ 1,087,060.77

The most significant item in this months report is a change to the Technical Support Salary accounting. This change was made
as part of the General Funding budget adjustments needed, specifically, that district Technology Services salaries partially paid
out of the General Fund have now been moved to the Technology Levy budget. This change in Technical Support Salary is
retroactive to September 2023, leaving $112,929.57 remaining.

As we cannot change the initial Salary Budget Capacity number of $1,119,643.00, the upcoming monthly reports will show
Technical Support Salary as going over budget. Despite the increases in Technical Support Salary, we anticipate ending the
school year within our overall Technology Levy budget capacity of $2,866,770.00. To achieve this, we have paused the
Interactive Flat Panel project originally planned for this summer and have reduced some spending in the other categories of
Learning, Teaching, Infrastructure, and Communication and Productivity.
The only other noteworthy expenditures since the last report in March 2024, have been networking vendor updates/licensing
renewals and one planned projection system replacement for Commodore Options School.

a. Commentary
b. Summary of Revenues and Expenditures, with Graphs
c. Cash Flow Forecast
2. Budget Status Reports for All Funds
Commentary:
Revenues:
YTD revenues are trending slightly under projections at $34,478,701. Collections are 4.6% higher than the prior year.
Revenues for March were $4,848,666.
This represents a decrease of 1.4%, or $70,196 compared to 2023. This is largely attributable to local levy
collections, which are down $150,150 compared to this same period last year.
Expenditures:
General Fund expenditures for March were $5,110,437. YTD expenditures are $37,812,706 which is 2.8% higher than
the amount expended last year for the same time period.

The journal entries were completed to retroactively assign tech salaries to the levy. This accounts for the difference
between reported expenditures in February and March.
Fund Balance:
As of March 31st, 2024, the ending fund balance in the General Fund was $2,154,966.77
