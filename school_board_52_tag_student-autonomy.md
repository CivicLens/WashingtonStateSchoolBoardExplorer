## 2024-08-12 - LA_CONNER_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The La Conner School Board of Directors held a special meeting on August 12, 2024, to discuss various action items, including the adoption of several resolutions. Notably, they adopted Resolution No. 24-19, which pertains to a General Fund Budget Extension for the 2023-2024 fiscal year, allowing an increase in expenditures by $1.3 million primarily due to the receipt of the 21st Century Grant, which amounted to $425,000. The board also approved a budget extension for capital projects (Resolution No. 24-20) related to a $1.9 million Solar Grant. 

In addition, the board discussed a significant policy change regarding cell phone use in schools. Starting in the 2024-2025 school year, the district plans to implement a cell phone-free environment to enhance student engagement and mental health by reducing distractions. This initiative follows unsuccessful attempts over the past two years to limit cell phone use and aligns with practices adopted by nearby districts. The board expressed support for the policy, which aims to foster better social interactions and academic focus among students. The implementation will involve using Yondr pouches for high school students and locked cases for middle school students to store their devices during school hours. The board is seeking community feedback to facilitate a smooth transition to this new policy.
