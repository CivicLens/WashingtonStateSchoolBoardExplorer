At the meeting on February 28, 2022, the board approved the 2022-2023 Executive Director contracts for
Finance and Operations (Amber Porter) and for Teaching and Learning (Stacy Thomas). The Executive
Director salary rate referenced in each contract was based upon an estimate of the state's IPD (Implicit
Price Deflator) which is used to calculate administrative salaries. However, the legislature later approved
a final IPD amount for the 2022-2023 school year which is significantly higher than anticipated. Therefore,
the board is now asked to approve a $2,000 increase to the Executive Director salary level for the 20222023 school year.
