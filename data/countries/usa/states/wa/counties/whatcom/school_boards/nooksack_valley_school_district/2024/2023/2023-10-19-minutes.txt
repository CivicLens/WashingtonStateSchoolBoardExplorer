COMMUNICATIONS
a.
Ricky Nonhoff addressed the board and shared concerns about a number of issues related to
student safety and well-being. She shared her daughter’s experiences at the high school in which she
was assaulted and the impacts of that trauma. She is concerned that students, and society in general,
are afraid to speak out and take a stand against violence. She urged the board and community to do
more to address this and normalize behaviors that end violence instead of enabling it.
b.
Jennifer Lautenbach shared her appreciation of the board and the work they continue to do for
children. She shared that the Levy campaign team is beginning preparation and is excited to support
the replacement levy and show continued support for our schools.
c.
Steven VanMiddendorp shared his concerns for the continued increase in assessed value and
the impact on overall taxes. He indicated that continuing to raise school taxes is a hard sell for him.

SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT
a.
Strategic Planning Goal #3: Amplifying parent and student voice, specifically fall parent
conferences. The district tried a new format this year, having conferences earlier and structuring them
to be about forging a strong partnership with families, as opposed to only sharing progress. In four
days, over 90% of district parents engaged with teachers to discuss student needs, strengths, etc. As
with any new format, there was mixed feedback. Each school will dig into the comments and share out
future plans.
b.
Capital Projects: Supt. Galley updated the board on progress with the PAC cladding project,
Sumas Bus Garage, and future safety efforts.
c.
Replacement Levy: Supt. Galley led a conversation about the upcoming levy campaign, the
programs supported by the levy, the proposed amounts to collect and estimated rates. Follow the link
below for more details.
