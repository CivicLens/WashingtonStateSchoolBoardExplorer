support.

staff throughout our district.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
GP-7.2 – 2023-24 Annual Board Agenda, Revised – general review.
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Mason has deep gratitude and appreciation for this community after the levy
measures passed, and she is disappointed that some districts did not receive the
support from their communities. She continues to be frustrated by the way this state
determines education funding. The Kulshan Middle School visit was great. The new
addition is lovely, and it demonstrated to her how the physical aspect of a school
matters. She shared her appreciation for the district’s inclusion work, which has
enabled her child to participate in school events such as Mountain School and fifth
grade strings.
• Mr. Ritchey shared his excitement about the passage of the two levies. He is the
parent of three children who attended Carl Cozier Elementary School, and the news
about the new building and location is encouraging. The visit to Kulshan gave him an
appreciation for the complexity involved when a capital project is underway while
school is in session and students are on the campus. The Kulshan music teacher gave
a fantastic overview which reinforced the importance of the district’s music
programs.
• Ms. Rose also expressed gratitude for the recent passage of the levies. It was very
evident while she attended the WSSDA Legislative Conference and Day on the Hill
that there is a need to continue to advocate for sufficient funding, especially in light
of how students have changed since the state model was last updated. She agrees that

teaching students in a way they understand and teaching them how to be a part of a
community is important when talking about inclusion. She shared a reflection from
her time as a student, and she’s grateful to be in a school district and community that
tells all children that they belong.
Ms. Diaz Hackler agreed that the levy passage was great news. While at the
legislative conference in Olympia, she and Ms. Rose met with two sets of state
representatives, because our school district is located within two different legislative
districts. She would be interested in inviting legislators to visit our schools. She
believes the capital improvements at Kulshan will be enjoyed by the surrounding
neighborhood.
Mr. Benjamin appreciates that Ms. Rose and Ms. Diaz Hackler attended the
legislative conference. He enjoyed the Kulshan visit but missed seeing students since
the visit occurred prior to the middle school start time. He has heard that Washington
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal will be attending the April 27
WSSDA DA-1 regional meeting on San Juan Island, and our board is registered to
attend. The board’s retreat that was previously scheduled for March 1 is being
rescheduled to April 26, to coincide with the DA-1 regional meeting. He asked if the
board would be interested in completing the WSSDA self-assessment prior to the
board retreat. All board members indicated they would be interested, and Mr.
Benjamin will forward the self-assessment information to each board member. He
appreciated Ms. Mason’s remarks and agrees that the passage of the levies is a clear
reflection of how our community supports public education.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
Impressive steady year-after-year growth in grants applied for and received, the total grant dollars
received, and the number of successful applications indicate success in our endeavors.
Grants secured for specific areas of need and interest, mental health and sustainability.
Strong evidence of continued and new community partnerships.
The district continues to use a robust and transparent budget development process, excellent work
with local partners to result in new space(s) for Community Transitions.
The annual Budget Book continues to be a remarkable document that both educates and outlines
the moral nature of the district budget. This effort should reinforce community trust in the
district’s efforts, especially important as we bring two essential renewal levies to the voters in
2024.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
None, we appreciate Dr. Baker’s commitment to ongoing learning and improvement for the
budget planning and management process. These efforts are important and ongoing.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
There is evidence that district facility/transportation management was well maintained despite an
almost 15% reduction in associated staff due to budget cuts, and the addition of new facility
technologies (e.g., building entrance protocols). Even with these cuts, APP scores remain roughly
the same as last year (2022), and in many cases exceed those in 2021. Numerous outside agency
observers have confirmed this. It is commendable that the district has identified a pathway to
managing the complex mix of properties and some very old facilities with fewer staff due to the
budget challenges of the district.
The pace of facility replacements/upgrades continues to be impressive.
There has been a commendable amount of safety training and process improvement during this
reporting period. Transportation safety is of key concern for all parents with children who are
supported by district transportation and the accomplishment of our district’s achievement for
‘outstanding bus inspections’ is an important part of that safety puzzle. It is great to see the
district investing in cyber risk management as they could seriously impact our ability to fulfill the
mission of the district otherwise.
The continued use of a Sustainability Advisory Committee and a Climate Action Plan show clear
focus and efforts working toward high standards of energy use and conservation. All recently
constructed facilities well exceed WSSP sustainability standards. This report really demonstrates
the various benefits of newer buildings, including for energy efficiency.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
Thank you for providing additional information to the EL-9 report regarding the specific data on
reported staff injuries, including staff injured by students. Due to the anomalous nature of the
numbers for this past reporting period, we would appreciate watching them over the next year and
hopefully getting a clearer understanding in the next EL-9 report.
Ongoing dedication to improved sustainability is an important challenge, well-reflected in the
work of the Climate Action Plan and effort by the advisory committee, management efforts and
staff work.
4. Comments on the report itself.
Comprehensive, plenty of data to support compliance. The Board appreciate the presentation of
multiple years of data and the factual presentation of relevant data.

stakeholders, ensuring that requests align with The Bellingham Promise, especially the district’s
commitment to equity. The Board has been well informed during this process, and results are
