The off-site mitigation area is located on an undeveloped five-acre parcel on Northwest Drive the district
recently purchased. The mitigation work will include wetland re-establishment, wetland enhancement,
wetland preservation, upland buffer enhancement, and preservation of high quality riparian habitat.

Public Content
Acting Superintendent's
Recommendation: This policy is being presented for a first reading and no action is required at this time.
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent, Business and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
In May 2009 the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) implemented new rules to ensure
that the major infrastructure systems of buildings that received state financial assistance after January
1,1994 are maintained and operating efficiently in order for those buildings to be eligible for future state
financial assistance for modernization. These new rules are referred to as the Asset Preservation
Program (APP). Buildings are eligible for financial assistance for modernization 30 years after they are
built.
The APP is a systematic approach to ensure system performance and promote student health and
safety. This is accomplished by maintaining and operating building systems to their design capacity, and
thereby maintaining an encouraging learning environment and extending building life.
For districts like us who have buildings accepted by the Board in 1995, that were partially funded using
state financial assistance (Kulshan Middle School), we are required to have a board resolution and policy

in place by June 30, 2010.
Following the adoption of the policy we will need to:
(a) certify that we have an Asset Preservation System (APS) in place by January 1, 2011;
(b) conduct an initial building condition evaluation and report the results to the Board and to OSPI
by April 1, 2011;
(c) each year thereafter, provide an annual report to the Board and;
(d) every six years thereafter, provide a certified report (conducted by a certified evaluator) to the
Board and OSPI.
The evaluation and report will include assessment and condition information associated with all major
exterior, interior, mechanical, and safety/code systems including but not limited to foundations, walls,
roofs, floors, electrical, plumbing, heating, fire alarm, emergency lighting, etc.
Mr. Cowan will be happy to answer any of your questions.

Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent, Business and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
An additional requirement of the new Asset Preservation Program (APP) is for the Board to adopt a
resolution acknowledging participation in the APP. Adoption of the attached resolution will enable the
district to comply with this requirement. It is being presented for a first reading and may not be adopted
until after adoption of the policy at the June 24, 2010 School Board meeting.
Mr. Cowan will attend the Board meeting and will be happy to answer any of your questions.
