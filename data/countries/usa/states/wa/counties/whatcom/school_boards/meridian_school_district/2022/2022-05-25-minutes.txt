PUBLIC COMMENT
Melissa Henry – Melissa voiced her concerns about the task force committee for the comprehensive sexual
health curriculum. She felt the more conservative point of view was disregarded during the committee process
and selection of curriculum.

Harriet Bauman – Harriet wanted to give a shoutout to our transportation department. Her family has new
neighbors who have backgrounds having trouble with the law. They asked for our transportation department
to create a plan to ensure their daughter was safe when she gets home every day. The transportation
department has gone above and beyond to do this for her daughter.
Aaron Wolven – Aaron has four kids in the district. He wanted to speak about the sex education the curriculum.
He has been with the Bellingham Fire Department for 15 years and has been on many calls for teen suicides.
Many of the calls he’s been on involve LGBTQIA students. He stated that we know that if we support queer
kids, we cut the likelihood of them committing suicide in half. Many of us have family who belong to that
community, and I think this new curriculum does a great job of showing there are many ways to show love
and see our bodies starting from a young age. Hopefully, this curriculum can help stop some suicides down
the road.
