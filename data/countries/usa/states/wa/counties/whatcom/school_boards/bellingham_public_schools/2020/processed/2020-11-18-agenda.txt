Explanation of Issue:
Resolution 29-20 certifies the district's levy collections for calendar year 2021 to Whatcom County. This adjusts the local levy to the levy
authority as authorized by voters, plus the refunds that are collectible by the district, as advised by Whatcom County. This resolution adjusts
Resolution 27-20 to include these refunds for the debt service and capital levies. Under law, the board of directors is required to certify the
levy amount to the assessor by November 30.

Explanation of Issue:

State law, federal regulations (where we are using federal funds) and district policy require certain
bidding requirements and competitive bidding of purchases above certain thresholds. The board may
waive bid requirements in the event of an emergency. The need to ensure air quality at higher levels as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic is important for bringing students and staff into school buildings.
Obtaining appropriate air filters given the country-wide need is challenging. Accordingly, we are asking
for the board to approve a waiver of bidding requirements for this purchase.
