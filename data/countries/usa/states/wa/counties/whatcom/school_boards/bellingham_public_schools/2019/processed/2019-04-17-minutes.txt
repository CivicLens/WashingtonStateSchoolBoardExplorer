OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
April 17, 2019 - 1306 Dupont St., Bellingham, Washington
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Diaz Hackler called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. Present: Directors Kelly
Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler (President), Jenn Mason, Quenby
Peterson, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder). She acknowledged that
this meeting is being held on the ancestral homelands of Indigenous Peoples, in particular
the Lummi Nation and the Nooksack tribe.
Audience:
• Amy Brewster – Works at Sehome High School as a student success coordinator and
is a co-vice president for Bellingham Association of School Employees (BASE). She
knows that it will be a tough year where budget is concerned, and she hopes that
bargaining goes well for everyone.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Dr. Baker shared a King 5 News story regarding Shuksan’s breakfast in the classroom
program.
• A budget message went out last week, and Dr. Baker has received a handful of
messages from staff and community members. More and more districts are sending
out budget messages, with most districts sharing that they will be experiencing some
level of budget cuts. Dr. Baker will be joining other members of WASA (Washington
Association of School Administrators) in Olympia next week to meet with legislators.
The positive news regarding budget is there will likely be an increase in special
education funding. District administrators are working with the principals at each
level on staffing. If the legislature finishes their work on time, May 15 will be the
deadline for reduction in force letters to be delivered to staff.
• Executive Director of Capital Projects and School Facilities Ron Cowan shared an
update on the district’s construction projects, including the fields at Squalicum High
School; the progress of the Parkview Educational Specifications/Design Advisory
Committee; and Sehome High School’s fields, parking lots and sidewalks.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports
• Mr. Benjamin will be registering for the WSSDA regional workshop in Ferndale on
May 11. He attended the NSBA conference in Philadelphia at the end of March, and
two areas of interest that stood out for him were efforts surrounding equity and
LGBTQ inclusion. He would like the board to be specific in its policy to call out
equity and inclusion for the LGBTQ community. He was impressed with a class led
by Bill Parrett, who is a co-author of the book “Disrupting Poverty.”
• Ms. Mason attended the Whatcom Middle School Talent Show: Bashing the Binary,
as did Ms. Bashaw. She also attended the NSBA conference in Philadelphia and went
to many great sessions at the conference, a few of which were focused on equity. An
American Dialect Society presentation she attended was interesting, as was a
segregation session led by districts from the south, where the importance of what
students of color bring to the table was emphasized.
• Ms. Peterson attended a town hall meeting featuring Representatives Debra Lekanoff
and Sharon Shewmake.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler noted that the origami paper cranes that are on the tables tonight
were created by students attending the Whatcom Detention Educational Program.
• Ms. Bashaw enjoyed the March 27 “Supporting Families through Hardships” linkage,
where she learned a lot about the Brigid Collins Family Support Center and how their
organization is growing.
