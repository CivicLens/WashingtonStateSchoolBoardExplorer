  2. Public Hearing
  A. 2024-2025 Budget
  Director Larson called for Public Comments on the 2024-2025 Budget. 
  Joe Camacho - FHS Staff - Shared the following questions with the Board regarding the 24-25 budget: 
  1. With the addition of activities 23, 26, and 73 to the allowed expenditures for CTE what impacts can we expect to the CTE program and budget? (Principals Office, Health and Related Services, information services)
  CFO Fleming shared that at this time we anticipate minimal impact.  In previous years, we were charging a portion of principal to activity 21 (supervision) since activity 23 (principal) was not open.  This was a common practice for all school districts around the state.
  2. Page 15 of the 24-25 budget shows a decrease in the vocational education budget- what caused the decrease and what impacts do you anticipate this will have?  
  CFO Fleming shared that the CTE funding is directly tied to total enrollment of the district.  Because we have anticipated enrollment loss compared to 23-24, CTE funding is lower.
  3. What is the percentage of the carry-over limitation for CTE?
  CFO Fleming shared that the carry-over limitation for CTE is 10%. 
             4. What happens to funds that are carried over? Are those funds still restricted by the CTE expenditure limitations? 
  CFO Fleming shared that CTE funds that are carried over can only be spent on CTE-related expenditures in the following year.  We are not allowed to spend carryover on any other expenditure category.
  5. What is the limit for indirect costs that can be charged to CTE?
        CFO Fleming shared that the limit for indirect costs that can be charged to CTE is 5%.
  6. What does restricted revenue mean? 
  CFO Fleming shared that restricted revenue means the revenue can only be used for its intended purpose.  That means the revenue we receive for CTE can only be spent on CTE-eligible expenditures.
