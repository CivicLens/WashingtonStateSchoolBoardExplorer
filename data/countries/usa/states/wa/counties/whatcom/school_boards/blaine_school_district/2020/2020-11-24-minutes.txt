  Minutes
  1. Special Board Meeting
A. Call to Order
Due to restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, this meeting was conducted with remote director participation.
President Gibson called the meeting to order at 7:08 p.m.
All Directors were in attendance.
     Todd Nunamaker, Dougal Thomas, Joan Lotze, Charles E Gibson, Laura McKinney
  2. Executive Session
A. Executive Session
After the meeting was called to order, it was announced that the board would move into executive session for the purpose of consulting with legal counsel regarding the legal risks of a proposed action. The executive session was anticipated to last for up to one hour, and any extension of time added to that hour would be announced. The executive session would be followed, in regular session, by consideration of action to direct the superintendent on next steps in returning secondary students to in-person instruction. The directors left the open session and transitioned to a separate virtual meeting. Due to technical difficulties with joining the separate meeting, the executive session did not start until 7:35 p.m.

At 8:10 p.m., Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger made a verbal announcement in the open session, saying that there would be an extension of thirty (30) minutes to the executive session. Any additional extension would be announced.
  3. Reconvene & Action
A. Return of Secondary Students to In-Person Instruction
At 8:55 p.m., the executive session ended and the directors transitioned back to the open session. The meeting reconvened at 9:02 p.m.
  President Gibson questioned if action should be taken by the board, and Dr. Granger explained that the board has the option of discussing the agenda's action item and taking a roll call vote. Director McKinney asked Dr. Granger to restate his recommendation. Dr. Granger recommended pausing the return of 6th and 9th grade students for one week to give him time to work collaboratively with the local Health Department and to see if either community case counts improve or if the Health Department will agree to an alternative level of phase-in for Blaine's 6th and 9th grade students. This one-week pause would provide Dr. Granger with time to continue the work he has been doing and to advocate for Blaine students to be treated equally to those in other Whatcom County school districts.

Director McKinney indicated that, based upon the recommendation of the district's attorney, she would agree with Dr. Granger's recommendation. Director Thomas commented that it's very clear all directors on the board want students to return to in-person learning as soon as possible, but the district has certain constraints which will not allow it. Director Lotze encouraged clear communication with parents and students in the next few weeks to clarify the rationale for this decision.
  Dr. Granger affirmed that everyone in this group wants students to have the ability to return. He is committed to continue working towards this goal and advocating for students to be treated equitably. The district will release a formal announcement to families tomorrow. Dr. Granger stated that these decisions are not entered into lightly. Although the district remains focused on getting students back into buildings, because of the structure of state government, it must only be done with the support of the local Health Department.
  The board voted unanimously to follow the recommendation of the superintendent to pause on the return of 6th and 9th grade students for one week and to follow the recommendation of the Health Department with additional communication to follow.
