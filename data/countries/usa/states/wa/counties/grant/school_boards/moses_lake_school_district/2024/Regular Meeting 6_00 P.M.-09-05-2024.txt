----- Written Comment(s) ----Dana Waggener - Forensic Audit

I agree with Paul Hill on the need for a forensic audit and prosecution, if needed, 150%. I will not vote for
another Levy until this is completed. I will also be one of your largest opponents until this is done. It
appears there were huge misappropriation of tax payer funds during this period and the tax payers are
due a complete explanation prior to another levy vote. You talk about being totally transparent, then you
need to walk the walk!
Casey CooperTitle IX Resolution 2025-1
First, I want you to know that I have the utmost respect for the position that the board is in. There are no easy solutions, and the
"right" solutions may require a lot of sacrifice in money and opportunities for our students. Second, (just a clerical correction) there
is a typo in the third to last paragraph (the "c" is missing from the word "directors". Third, and much more importantly, the
resolution says, "... decision makers and elected officials must act to correct our current situation." Simply putting out a resolution
that in one very small pace says (generally and without specifics), "...the current status of WIAA regulations, Washington State
Law, and Federal Law is not working for our students...," is not "acting" in any meaningful sense. At the very least, the specific
issue needs to be addressed with at least some detail. This resolution looks like a plain attempt to placate constituents without
having to do or change anything. Either pass a resolution that directly addresses the problem and states what actions you will be
taking, or don't pass one at all and explain to the public that your hands are completely tied. I do understand that turning against the
current authorities in our state would cause serious legal difficulties as well as having to form a new interscholastic athletic
association, but those are possibilities, even if they may not be the right ones for our district right now. You still must at least
address them and why you are choosing to do nothing except present this worthless resolution. If you are going to take a stand, do
it and risk the consequences, otherwise don't "resolve" to do nothing about it and feel like you are serving the public. Thank you
for your service.

David Hunt-Title IX Resolution 2025-1
Honorable Board Members,
In April 2024, the Biden administration introduced new rules, aimed to expand Title IX's protections to include gender
identity and sexual orientation. These new rules were aimed to take effect August 1st, 2024. These new rules would
have detrimental consequences to womens sports, nationwide and in the Moses Lake School district.
Numerous injunctions, by Federal Judges have been granted, to stop these insane new rules, that would discriminate
against women in the United States, and the MLSD.

On August 16th, 2024 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the injunctions against the Biden administration. (See
Department of Education v Louisiana and Cardona v Tennessee).
The emergency requests covered injunctions by two courts that completely blocked the new rule from taking effect in
10 states. Other courts have issued similar injunctions blocking the entire rule in an additional 16 states, and the
Supreme Court's decision will presumably keep those other injunctions in place.
One such injunction that wasn't specifically before the high court, issued by a federal judge in Kansas, blocks the
regulation in four states but is also in force at any school across the nation attended by the members of three groups
that joined the challenge-Moms for Liberty, Young America's Foundation, and Female Athletics United.
Those lists include schools in all 24 states not covered by a statewide injunction. This would also include the Moses
Lake School District, as there are members of Moms for Liberty, with kids in the school district. That injunction
significantly expands the geographicscope of where the new Title IX is blocked. The States and others challenging the
regulation argued that the new definition pervades the entire new regulation and provisions could not be easily
separated into what could take effect and what could not.
Attached are two resolutions from the Wenatchee School District and Kennewick School District. I respectfully request
this honorable board to take similar immediate action, to defend these young women in our district, against the
disastrousregulations being forced upon our district by the Biden administration, and Governor Inslee. I would request
the school board work with the other 8 school districts in Grant County, and across Washington State, and join
together with one attorney, to file an immediate injunction in Federal Court for Washington State.
I would also like to take a moment and thank all of you for your commitment to the kids in our district. Through no fault
of your own, you inherited the problems from previous administrations.
The decisions you were faced with left you in a no- win situation with the public. I am greatly encouraged by our new
Superintendent Carol, and how quickly she has cleaned up some of the problems she inherited. Her devotion to this
district speaks volumes about her and the integrity she has as a superintendent. I believe with your leadership and
Carol, the students in the MLSD will see proficiency scores go up, less violence, and a better outcome for the students
you care for.
Respectfully,
DavidHunt

252D%253E%2D%2D%3E-->The MLSD board and administration have not listened to the community, thus
these hardships for students. Being transparent with the voting population and having competent employees are
key issues that need to be addressed if future levies are to be passed.
