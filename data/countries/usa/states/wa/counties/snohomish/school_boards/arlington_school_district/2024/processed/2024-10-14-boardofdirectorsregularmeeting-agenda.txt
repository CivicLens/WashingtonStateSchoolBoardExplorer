Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulg√°b).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time
immemorial and their ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice
the traditional ways of their ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural
traditions passed on to them by their ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these
lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its
Indigenous people, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history,
and can demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.

Type :

Contract as presented.

Goal 4: Voices and Partnerships

Public Content
Submitted by:
Karl Olson, Director of Categorical Programs
Background Information:
Arlington Public Schools contracts with the Human Services Department of Snohomish County to fund the ECEAP Preschool Program.
ECEAP partners with families to prepare their children for success in kindergarten and beyond. This program provides free preschool to
families who meet financial requirements. This specific contract amendment adds additional funds for the 2024-25 school year in order to
continue offsetting the total cost of the program. We are a sub-recipient of these funds, and they will be utilized to provide additional
Assistant Teachers for classroom support, a two-hour secretary position daily, and continued supplies for the inclusive playground project.
This current amendment represents an increase of $157,500 from the previous contract approved by the Board on August 28, 2023.
Administrative Considerations:
Research demonstrates the importance of early education. Due to financial constraints, many families are not able to provide a preschool
experience for their children. ECEAP works to strengthen the entire family and provides a positive opportunity for the pre-kindergarten age
students and their families.
Budgetary Impact:
This amendment provides an additional $157,500.00 from federal funds, specifically the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The total funds
available for the 2024-25 school year is now $396,300.

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the 2024-2025 renewal
agreement with Jamf for student and teacher device
management and security.

Public Content
Submitted by:
Dr. Matt Jurick, Director of Technology
Background Information:

The Technology Department uses the Jamf suite of management tools to securely manage all 675
District-owned Macs; 2,800 iPads, and 250 Apple TVs. The cost has increased from last year's renewal
of roughly $39,500 primarily due to an increased use of the Jamf Protect security endpoint service, which
is now more heavily used to help secure the District devices and network against cyber threats.
Administrative Considerations:

The total cost of the 2024-2025 service agreement with Jamf is $45,562.50.
Budgetary Impact:

The service will be paid for using technology budget funds.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:

The current service agreement expires December 7, 2024, so Board approval is needed prior to that time.

Goals :

Public Content
Submitted by:
Kerri Helgeson, Director of Equity and Student Well-Being
Background Information:
Over the past several years, mental health services were provided to Arlington School District students who would not have received them
otherwise. Mental health counselors work continuously with 6-7students each day at all of our schoolsand engagedin several mental health
triage situations. Mental health support has been an increasing need across the District and is identified as a priority for Arlington students.
These are the same contracted mental health services as in previousyears, and would becontracted by PHD#3 to provide services.
Administrative Considerations:
The district will provide space for each mental health counselor in their respective buildings to meet with students, staff, and families, in
exchange for services at no cost to the families. PHD#3 has a separate agreement with each mental health counselor to reimburse them for
services that cannot be billed, or the difference between insurance reimbursement and cost for service.
Budgetary Impact:
There will be no fiscal impact to the district by engaging in this cooperative agreement.

Public Content

Brian Long, Director of College and Career Readiness

Background Information:
The School-to-Work program offers students comprehensive career education through practical work experiences and career awareness
sessions. Key components include work-based learning, job shadows and summer internships, guest speaker sessions from various
professions, and industry-focused field trips. Events and presentations cover topics like college applications and financial aid to further
students career knowledge. The program has seen increased participation and completion rates over time. Future goals include
strengthening partnerships, expanding job shadow and field trip opportunities, and introducing early career planning at the middle school
level. Lisa Rodino is the program coordinator.

Administrative Considerations:
The School-to-Work program requires careful planning and coordination with stakeholders, including businesses for internships and job
shadows, guest speakers, and educational institutions for field trips. Maintaining student engagement, assessing learning outcomes, and
adapting to evolving workforce needs are essential. Expanding outreach to underprivileged students and middle schools requires strategic
planning. Program administration should focus on continuous improvement by tracking participation, completion rates, and student feedback
to guide future enhancements.

Budgetary Impact:
The School-to-Work program is sustainably funded through Career and Technical Education (CTE) resources, with an annual budget of
approximately $8,000, excluding personnel compensation. The program efficiently maximizes these funds to deliver students a
comprehensive, high-quality career readiness experience.
