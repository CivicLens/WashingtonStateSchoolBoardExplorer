OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
September 15, 2021 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Mason called the meeting to order at 6 p.m. She acknowledged that this meeting,
while attended from various locations, is being held on the ancestral homelands of the
Coast Salish people. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz
Hackler, Jenn Mason (President), Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri
O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
Ms. Mason noted that, because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19, public
participation is limited to written submissions only, and all written comments received
will be shared with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all messages
received.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
The 2021-22 school year is off to a great start. Alderwood and Parkview elementary
schools opened their new buildings to students on Sept. 1. Construction is underway at
Sunnyland, with students using Memorial Park for recess and P.E. Dr. Baker shared first
day photos from schools across the district.
There have been some challenges due to the pandemic. The COVID-19 team continues to
monitor cases, perform contact tracing and communicate with affected families. The
mask mandate has been a topic on the local and national level and some peaceful
protestors gathered with signs outside of the District Office in August one afternoon.
Staff have worked with students and parents opposed to masks over the first few days of
school. The human resources department is contacting employees who have not yet
provided proof of vaccination, and it is predicted that a high percentage of staff will be
vaccinated prior to the state’s deadline. After questions from the board, Assistant
Superintendent of Teaching and Learning Jay Jordan and Executive Director of
Operations Jessica Sankey provided a short update about processes being used, including
principal support and close contacts. Dr. Baker noted that the district is adhering to the
Department of Health requirement that we maximize in-person instruction and minimize
transmission. For individual students who are out of the classroom due to exposure,
teachers are working directly with the student to receive instruction. If an entire class is
required to quarantine, remote learning will be put into place, similar to last year. The

district has assisted with COVID-19 testing for some athletic programs, with the
assistance of Director of Athletics and Activities Laurel Peak.
Like other districts, our district is looking to hire bus drivers, and some paraprofessional
positions are not yet filled. Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources Bob Kuehl and
Ms. Sankey responded to questions from board members regarding the bus driver
shortage.
Food services has experienced supply chain issues and are adjusting menus when
deliveries are not received.
Dr. Baker shared that student enrollment this fall is similar to last fall, with enrollment
being approximately 250 students fewer than at the beginning of the pandemic.
Bellingham Virtual Learning and Bellingham Family Partnership Program enrollment
have increased, while elementary enrollment has decreased. Middle school enrollment
decreased by a small amount, while high school enrollment increased a little. Enrollment
estimations were accurate, so the budget has not been negatively impacted. Assistant
Superintendent of Teaching and Learning Kristi Dominguez and Mr. Kuehl responded to
questions regarding kindergarten enrollment. Executive Director of Family Engagement
Isabel Meaker responded to a question regarding how students are being connected to
higher education.
Last week a request for applications to a Facilities Planning Task Force went out. The
task force will include approximately 30 members including high school students,
community members/partners, City of Bellingham representatives and parents and staff
from Carl Cozier, Columbia, Roosevelt and Community Transitions. The task force will
begin meeting on Sept. 23 and will be looking at the possible replacement of Carl Cozier,
Columbia and Roosevelt elementary schools, using a swing space concept; a new
Community Transitions location and district-wide improvements. The task force will also
discuss current projects, including Sunnyland; high school fields and tennis courts; the
District Office and the environmental education site. The work of the task force is slated
to conclude in November, and its recommendation may lead to the board being asked to
approve a resolution to place a bond measure on the Feb. 2022 ballot.
