Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the Budget and Enrollment
Reports as presented.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
September & October Budget Reports:
Fund balance and net cash: The beginning fund balance for the 2024-25 year was $1.29 million. As of the end of September 2024, the fund
balance was $771,744. October 2024's fund balance is approximately $2.65 million (compared to $4.17 million last October 2023) and net
cash is approximately $5.04 million (compared to $6.44 million last October 2023). These balances have increased from the previous month
which is the normal pattern at this time of year. Consistent with prior year trends, fund balance, net cash, and revenues show a large spike in
October from receipt of a large portion of local property taxes. November will show a decline especially since the state apportionment
allocation in November is only 5% of the total allocation versus 9% in other months. The district anticipates needing an interfund loan for the
month of November in order to maintain a positive cash-flow and meet November's obligations for payroll and other bills. Sufficient resources
will be received for the interfund loan to be fully paid back by the end of the fiscal year. Fund balance and net cash will continue to decrease
in the coming months as the influx of levy dollars tapers down, until the next big influx in April. Meanwhile expenditures will remain at a fairly
consistent monthly level. October's expenditures show a notable increase compared to the previous month, mainly because of the annual
property & liability insurance bill. The annual insurance bill for 2024-25 is approximately $1.3M. Half of this balance is paid in the fall, with the
other half coming due in the spring.
Local Tax Revenue: The district has received 32% of total budgeted General Fund tax revenues for the 2024-25 fiscal year. Tax revenues
received year-to-date amount to $3.75 million of the $11.7 million budgeted.
State Apportionment Revenues: The district is expecting to experience an increase in the State Apportionment allocation since actual
average full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment is approximately 63 more than budgeted enrollment. The amount of the increase will be
evident with January's apportionment which is when the State makes its annual 'true-up' on its payments to school districts. January is when
the state adjusts from paying school districts based on budgeted average student FTE to payments based on ACTUAL average student
FTE. The increase in apportionment will be spread out from January to August and is estimated to be between $600,000-$630,000.
November Enrollment Report:
The final November 2024 enrollment reports are submitted for Board review and approval. Actual enrollment for November 2024 was
5,534.74 FTE (Full-Time-Equivalent). November's enrollment increased 24.60 FTE compared to October's enrollment. The average FTE
taking into consideration September through November monthly enrollments is 5,499.18. This is 63.18 FTE more than budgeted enrollment
of 5,436.00 (not including Running Start).
Compared to 2023-24 average enrollment, the district is serving approximately 76 more student FTE in 2024-25 than the year before.

Previous Board Action:
Board acceptance of Budget Reports for August 2024 occurred at the November 12, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.
Octoberenrollment was approved by the Board during the October 28, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves Resolution 24-13
Interfund Loan.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
The District has been carefully tracking cash flow. Projections indicate continued cash shortfalls will be experienced for the month of
November, and through the months of December to mid-April and then into May. The District is requesting interfund loan authorization with
cumulative amounts not to exceed $3 million so that current obligations for November through mid-April/May can be met. The month of June
and into mid-July (until the State apportionment is received at the end of July) are also low points for cash flow. The District plans to request
board authorization for another temporary short-term interfund loan to meet those needs when that time comes.
Resources will be received later within this fiscal year which will be sufficient to payback the interfund loans. Tax revenue relief will be
received during the months of April and May. Apportionment will increase to align with actual enrollment during the months of January
through August, which will generate higher revenues for the District. Additionally, the July apportionment amount from the State is at a higher
amount than in other months according to the State's defined schedule. Other potential funds such as Safety Net and other grant revenues
will not be received until the end of August, September and even October. The District plans to transfer only that which is needed to meet
the current cash flow, one month at a time to minimize interest costs and to pay back all loan proceeds with interest as fund balance and
cash flow allows. The District projects that resources will be sufficient to repay loan balances by the time the year-end close processes are
complete and all revenue accruals have been made for the 2024-25 fiscal year.
WAC laws 392-123-135 through 160 and the State Accounting Manual for School Districts, allows for temporary interfund loans from the
Capital Projects Fund to the General Fund, provided the loan does not interfere with the operation of the Capital Projects Fund and that the
General Fund pays the amount of interest to the Capital Projects Fund that it would have earned had it remained invested with the County.

Budgetary Impact:
Interest must be paid by the borrowing fund to the loaning fund. The interest rate to be used is the rate the Snohomish County Treasurer
uses for the District's investments during the periods/months of the loan. The estimated loan interest to be paid to the Capital Projects Fund
could be approximately $24,000 over the course of the next 6 or 7 months. For example, if $500,000 is needed for the month of November,
the interest for that month's loan amount could amount to approximately $1,999.20. (Estimated using October's interest rate of 4.865% APR,
generates approximately $66.64 per day. If the $500,000 is utilized for 30 days, the cost would be $1,999.20) The amounts may vary and
change depending on the County's actual interest during the period as applied to the amount of the loan outstanding, and the payback date
(s). Monthly financial reports will specify actual outstanding interfund loans and actual interest charges involved.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:
The interfund loan must be authorized by Board Resolution prior to making the loan.
Previous Board Action:
Resolutions for Interfund Loans were approved by the board during the previous fiscal year at the January 22, May 28, and July 8, 2024,
regular board meetings.

Regular Meeting

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
This is an annual agenda item for the Board to give their input on the numbers and amounts of scholarships, based on the annual amount
provided for distribution from the Merl McGuire Mayo Scholarship endowment fund.
Mr. Merl McGuire Mayo was a 1936 graduate of Arlington High School who passed away in 2013. On October 14, 2013, the Board accepted
the initial donation of $2,441,708 from Mr. Mayo's estate. The Board accepted an additional $8,750 and adopted Resolution 14-02
establishing the endowment on February 24, 2014 when Mr. Mayo's estate was fully settled.
Based on his Last Will and Testament, Mr. Mayo intended that the principal amount of the endowment funds be maintained into perpetuity
for the benefit of Arlington High School students. Accordingly, the principal of the Trust cannot be distributed. However, the annual interest

earnings are used to support college scholarships for Arlington High School students.Board Resolution 14-06 provides the guidelines for the
Merl Mayo Scholarship Trust Fund, and is superseded by Resolution 19-03, in order to clarify the scholarship process and better align the
timelines with current practice.
Last year's 2023-24 contribution of Merl Mayo scholarship funds to Arlington Dollars for Scholars was $50,000. Per the Board's approval of
the numbers and amounts, this supported fourteen MerlMcGuire Mayo scholarships including twelve single year at $2,500 each and two 4year renewable scholarships at$2,500 each year over four years.
The finance department indicates a rounded amount of annual proceeds generated by the endowment for distribution in 2024-25is $67,000.
At this meeting, the Board will have an opportunity to discuss the number and amount of scholarships they want to make available out of the
$67,000. Scholarships may be provided that are renewable for one or more years. At the December 9 regular meeting, the Board will have
the opportunity to take action to approve the combination (number/amounts/years renewable) of scholarships that align to the $67,000. This
will allow time to make calculations and ensure the amounts add up to the $67,000.

A tool is attached that provides help in calculating combinations.
The following is an example of a potential combination of15 scholarships in number and amounts is as follows:
1 recurring scholarship of $4,500 over 4 years = $18,000
14 one time scholarships for $3,500 each = $49,000
Equals a Grand Total of $67,000
Or another example of 16 scholarships is as follows:
1 one time scholarship = $10,000
1 recurring scholarship of $4,000 over 2 years = $8,000
14 one time scholarships for $3,500 each = $49,000
Equals a Grand Total of $67,000
College costs are increasing and these scholarships are set in the range of $3,500 to $4,500 for a number of the scholarships, to make a
meaningful contribution for students awarded.
After the Board's determination, the District will provide written notice of its commitment of these funds to the Arlington Dollars for Scholars
prior to January 31, 2025, and will distribute the funds in the normal process by issuance of warrants to Arlington Dollars for Scholars before
the end of February. The Arlington Dollars for Scholars selection committee determines the individuals who will receive the scholarship
awards in their application/selection process according to financial need and academic merit.
Previous Board Action:
On February 24, 2014, the Board adopted Resolution 14-02 accepting the Mr. MerlMcGuire Mayo Endowment
On June 9, 2014, the Board adopted Resolution 14-06 establishing guidelines for the Merl Mayo Scholarship Trust
On April 22, 2019, the Board adopted Resolution 19-03 superseding Resolution 14-06 Merl McGuire Mayo Scholarship Fund Trust
Guidelines.
The Board recommended the number and amounts of scholarships for the Mayo Scholarship for 2023-24, during the November 27, 2023,
regular board meeting.
