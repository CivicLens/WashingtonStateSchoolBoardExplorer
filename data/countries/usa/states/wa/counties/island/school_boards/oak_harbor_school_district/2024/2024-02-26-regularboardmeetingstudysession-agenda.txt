2.04 MicroK12 Wireless Network Upgrade Proposal &
Agreement
Meeting :

Feb 26, 2024 - Regular Board Meeting & Study
Session

Category :

2. Consent Agenda

Type :

Action (Consent)

Public Content
The Information Services Department is recommending School Board approval of the RFP proposal submitted by MicroK12 for
new Ruckus wireless hardware.
After reviewing all the RFP bid submissions, the Ruckus Wireless submission that MicroK12 submitted meets all the district
needs and requirements while also using the latest technology standards in their proposal.
As this project is part of the E-rate funding process, the district will be using Federal Funds for approximately 60% of the wireless
hardware replacement, while the remaining 40% will be funded via the Information Services budget. To save additional money,
the IS Department will be installing this hardware rather than hiring contractors to complete this work.
This wireless upgrade project should ultimately lead to a more robust wireless infrastructure that is supported by the
manufacturer for at least the next 5 years. The updated technology will also allow for faster speed capability and more reliable
end user experience.
