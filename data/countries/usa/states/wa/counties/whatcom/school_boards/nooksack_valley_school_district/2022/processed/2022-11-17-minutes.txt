referenced numerous concerning actions she has heard from other places,
wanted to ensure those things were not happening at Nooksack.
b. A question was raised on how “books are chosen,” and discussion
followed. It was communicated that books are chosen for several reasons,

appropriate perspective taking, allows for windows into other experiences, to

of dignity, acceptance, and belonging. Books are not chosen if they: purport a
certain perspective, try to influence beliefs, do not have a strong connection
to the curriculum, and are not age appropriate.

learning and a question about the redistricting ballot measure that was to be
discussed in the superintendent’s report.

Superintendent Matt Galley gave a brief report on the following:
Enrollment Trends
Over the last four years enrollment has varied (1845, 1819, 1790, 1813).
Federal monies have been used to fill gap in overstaffing to allow for
smaller-than-normal class sizes. When those dollars run out, unless
enrollment increases beyond pre-covid levels, decisions will have to be
made.
Strategic Plan
Vision For Student Experience
a. Description: A vision for student experience is a holistic description
of what educators want students to feel and encounter over the course
of their time at school. It integrates social, emotional, and academic
learning and is simply a description of what we want students to feel at
school.
b. Purpose: A clear vision for student experience allows educators to
attend to student’ overall development, well-being, culture, and sense
of belonging. Ultimately, it describes what it takes to have happy and
proud students.
c. Perceptual Data
Suicide Prevention
a. Kim McGee and Lindsay Anderson gave a brief presentation on
suicide awareness and prevention training and measures the district
continues to take to support mental health in the district.
Teaching and Learning
a. Megan Vigre briefly shared the work she and our 3 TOSAs (teachers
on special assignment) are doing to support K-5 teachers through
“Labs” and new teachers.
