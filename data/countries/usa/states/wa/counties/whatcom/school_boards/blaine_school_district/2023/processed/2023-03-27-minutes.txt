  4. Reports
A. School Administrator and Borderite Athletics Reports
Each school administrator reviewed their monthly report to the board. A written report was also provided by Athletic Director Chas Kok who was unable to attend the meeting in person.
Blaine Primary School: Principal Michelle McKeown and Assistant Principal Kelli Alonso reported. The Bright K program is helping students build skills through the context of play. Self-advocacy skills are being developed within shared spaces. The Bedtime with Books event took place in the PAC. Staff professional development has focused on social emotional learning. Classified staff were celebrated in March, and the positive impact of the recess supervision team was highlighted. Kindergarten registration for next year is open and ongoing.
Blaine Elementary School: Principal Jordan Radke reported. The PTO hosted a successful Glow Dance for students and their families. Staff leadership teams are focused on MTSS. Classified staff were celebrated in March, and students enjoyed chasing giant bubbles on a sunny day this week. Upcoming events include family conferences, a book fair, and the BES Variety Show.
Blaine Middle School: Principal Darren Benson reported. The band and choir concert was mentioned, with the upcoming retirement of Bob Gray. A live performance by Taproot Theater helped students learn how to treat each other. A math lesson using dice was described. A creative SEL strategy using crafted brain break dice was explained. Upcoming events include a March Madness activity and assembly, Teacher Work Day, Spring Break, and family conferences.
Blaine High School: Principal Scott Ellis reported. March Madness activities were described. The HOSA and TSA clubs recently competed at the state level. Sabrina Boczek won the TSA state championship and will be going on to compete at the national level. CEL work in math was described. Natasha Lexin is teaching after-school Zumba and yoga classes for staff members.
  B. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment through the month of March. Although the transitional kindergarten program increased enrollment in February, the enrollment for kindergarten in March has again decreased. Overall enrollment continues to be more than 50 FTE below the budgeted level. It is typical for enrollment to decline during the spring months. Ms. Porter reviewed pre-pandemic enrollment which was higher than it is now. Schools do not collect information about why students withdraw, so the cause of this current trend is unclear. For the past two years, the practice of rolling up grade level enrollment for budget development has not worked well. The district will need to watch future trends to determine if a specific factor can be identified. Although many pre-pandemic aspects of school have returned, enrollment levels have not.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of February. In reviewing the month-to-month graph, she explained how the district's fund balance is impacted during first three months of a fiscal year by expenses being paid during that time for the prior fiscal year. The current year started with a higher fund balance due to ESSER funds received. Ms. Porter explained the district's intent to reserve funds during the current year while the budget is pacing ahead so that there will be funds available to supplement the lower revenue anticipated for next year. She explained efforts to also limit current expenditures as much as possible in order to build this savings.
  Ms. Porter explained the resolution being considered for adoption at this meeting which will direct the superintendent to develop a reduced education program plan for the 2023-2024 school year. This reduction is attributable to the legislature's lack of assurance that adequate funds will be available for the district to maintain current staffing levels. Based upon this, the resolution authorizes the development of a plan which the board may consider for adoption in April.
  D. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
The board had an opportunity to review minor updates to Procedure 2409P World Languages Mastery-Based Credit. The updates align with changes made by OSPI in how credits are awarded.
Facility Review Committee work is ongoing.
The Superintendent Advisory Committee has completed a review of the proposed weekly late start schedule which will be implemented next year.
The vaping lawsuit is wrapping up, and the board will take action at this meeting to accept the settlement with Juul.
Work is ongoing to identify suitable property for a school in Birch Bay.
A shop space at Blaine High School is being modified with a new ventilation system to accommodate a welding program. Dr. Granger explained that the shop was not originally designed to accommodate welding but is being modified for that purpose in response to student interest. A part for the ventilation system upgrade has been on back-order but recently arrived and will be installed soon.
A special alumni concert honoring Bob Gray is scheduled for May 2, 2023.
Due to the closure on February 28, the last day of school has been moved to June 20 which is also the day of the board's regular meeting for that month.
