Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulg√°b).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time
immemorial and their ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice
the traditional ways of their ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural
traditions passed on to them by their ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these
lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its
Indigenous people, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history,
and can demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.

Submitted by:
Dave McKellar, Director ofSpecial Education; and
Krissa Cramer, District Nurse
Background Information:
Each year, school districts in Washington State are requiredto conduct both near and distance vision screenings. This requires a lot of
coordination,planning, as well as extra equipment and personnel to accomplish it.The Lions Club has, once again, graciously stepped up to
support this work. TheArlington Lions Club provided approximately six to eight trained volunteers to screen all elementary and 7th-grade
students for vision in the fall of 2023. In addition to the seven elementary and middle schoolbuildings, students at Weston High School were
also screened. In total, the team covered nine buildings over six different days totaling 2,861 Arlington students screened for vision.
Of those screened, 220 students' families were notified that their student was in need of a formal vision referral for further testing. In addition
to the screenings, the Lions Club also sets up appointments and provides funding for exams and glasses for students in need.We are so
thankful for their assistance, and want to officially thank and honor Sharon Morrison and her team for spearheading this effort throughout our
district.We would also like to recognize Tam Conrad for her contributions by volunteering her timeto facilitate the logistics and scheduling for
each building throughout this process!
Administrative Considerations:
The District needs to plan for future screenings and coordination with the Lions Club or the need to purchase additional equipment for vision
screening requirements.
Budgetary Impact:
If we continue to work with the Lions Club, there is no cost.If we do this solely as a district, we would need to purchase additional screening
equipment.

Goal 2: Safe and Caring Environment

Public Content
Submitted by:
Kerri Helgeson, Director of Equity and Student Well-Being
Background Information:

The Student Support Advocate Program is for students identified as high risk for behavioral health issues.
The model involves placing a case manager in a school to help identify at-risk students' needs and
connect students and families with relevant services in and outside the K-12 system. This proactive
intervention model keeps students engaged in school by assessing needs, connecting them to existing
community resources, and advocating for their needs with the community and State Agencies. The
Student Support Advocate model employs a holistic approach that also addresses the needs of the family
in order to support students in reaching their potential.
Administrative Considerations:

The role of the Student Support Advocate is to provide case management services, including a
collaborative process of screening, planning, facilitation, care coordination, evaluation, and advocacy for
options and services to meet a student and family's comprehensive needs. This shall be accomplished
through communication and connection to available resources to reduce risk factors and increase
protective factors for each student. This Interlocal Agreement with Snohomish County for the Student
Support Advocate Program will run through December 31, 2024.
Budgetary Impact:

The Student Support Advocate Program is supported by a grant from Snohomish County in the amount
of $215,000.

Background Information:

The Arlington District Strategic Plan includes the district mission, values, equity statement and four goal
areas with identified metrics used to measure progress and ensure continuous improvement.
The four goal areas include: 1) Student Learning and Achievement; 2) Safe and Caring Environment; 3)
Resource Stewardship; and 4) Voices and Partnerships.
The Arlington District Strategic Plan was developed with important contributions from parents, students,
teachers, staff and community partners guided by the school board, superintendent and the Advisory
Council for Education (ACE) citizens committee.

The District Strategic Plan is a road map to help us achieve our mission to educate, prepare and inspire
each Arlington student. Each year, adjustments and revisions are considered.
Administrative Considerations:

The board reviewed and discussed the proposed revisions to the District Strategic Plan during the
January 22 Board Study Session. A few minor revisions were requested.
Budgetary Impact:

There will be minimal printing costs to print approximately 200 new brochures.
