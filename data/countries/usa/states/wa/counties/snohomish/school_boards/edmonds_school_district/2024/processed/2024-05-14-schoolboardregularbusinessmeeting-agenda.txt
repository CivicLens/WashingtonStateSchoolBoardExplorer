This program supports novice teachers (typically those in their first 2 years of teaching) in a variety of
ways, but the most valuable way has been the support of an experienced teacher mentor. Due to budget
cuts, we are moving away from a model with full-time released mentors (stationed at the ESC) and will be
using a model that has in-building mentors.

Recommended Action :

establishment of a student run Credit Union at Lynnwood
High School for the 2024-25 school year.

Public Content
Information: GESACredit Union in High School Program agreement with GESA Credit Union and the
Edmonds School District for Lynnwood High School for the 2024-25 school year.
Background:In partnership with local school districts and high schools, GESA Credit Union offers their
Credit Union in High School program to provide paid internship training and financial literacy development
for students in local high schools. In this program, GESA works with high schools to establish a studentrun Credit Union branch on the high school campus which is run by students trained and supervised by
GESA. This program operates at numerous high schools across Washington State and we wish to
establish such a program at Lynnwood High School for the 2024-25 school year.
In this program, a student manager is hired in late spring of 2023-24 school year and participates in a
summer paid training internship at a local GESA credit union branch. During the 2024-25 school year, the
student manager operates the high school branch as an extension of the school's Career and Technical
Education (CTE) student store class. The student is paid as an intern by GESA during the school year for
their management of the high school branch and is under weekly supervision of a GESA Credit union
staff member and student store instructor who oversees that program at the high school. The operation of
the credit union will involve assisting students with applying for and setting up savings accounts as well
as deposit and withdrawal of funds from those accounts. Details of this operation may be found on the
GESA Student Run Credit Union website as well as the attached GESA Credit Union in the High School
Program Agreement.
During this past school year, we have worked with GESA, the student store instructor, and Lynnwood HS
Administration to analyze the feasibility and support for this program. We have visited other high school
sites to learn more about the program and met with GESA staff to develop an implementation plan in
anticipation for launch in 2024-25. All parties are in full support of adding this program to Lynnwood High
School and seek approval from the board to partner with GESA to move forward with the program for
next year.

#24-11, Redirection of Selected Lease and Rental Earnings to the General Fund
Background:
RCW 28A.335.060 allows certain moneys derived from real property to be diverted from the Capital
Projects Fund to the General Fund with Board approval. The diverted funds, however, must be used for
non recurring costs related to operating school facilities, including expenses for maintenance. The district
has lease agreements with cellular providers at the Meadowdale Playfields site. The revenue generated
from these agreements is directed into the Capital Projects Fund per RCW 28A.225.060 and managed by
Facilities. District staff have evaluated all funding options and, to maximize all resources, recommends
the diversion of Capital Projects Fund revenue to the General Fund. Resolution #24-11 recommends that
up to $150,000 be redirected from the Capital Projects Fund to the General Fund in fiscal year 24-25.
Estimated revenues from this transfer are $130,000, but this allows for capacity should any new lease
agreements occur.
