OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
May 18, 2023 – Options High School, 2015 Franklin St., Bellingham, WA.
Call to Order/Land Acknowledgment:
Mr. Benjamin (Vice President) called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. He acknowledged
that this meeting is being held on the ancestral homelands of the Coast Salish people.
Roll Call:
Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler
(President)Jenn Mason, Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day
(recorder).
Audience:
• Sarah Catudio is in her 15th year working in the Bellingham Public Schools. She
provides special education services to students with complex communication and
support needs. She believes it is important that students love coming to school.
Research shows that inclusion is the best option for students, and it’s imperative that
we keep in mind the district’s legal obligation to students with disabilities as the
budget for the next school year is formed. She invited the board to visit her classroom
at Wade King Elementary.
• Miguel Perry is a member of the Local 425 Carpenters Union. He thanked the school
board, superintendent and capital projects staff for listening over the last few months
about the importance of hiring union workers in our community. He also thanked the
district for providing opportunities for students to enter the trades. The union will
continue to communicate with the Director of Career and Technical Education.
• Carin Carter has been an employee of the school district for 18 years, 16 of those as a
permanent employee. She believes that removing expertise from the classroom does
not show that the district values the students being served. The classified staffing cuts
will not enable the school staff to meet as a team, plan and debrief. Inclusion will not
be supported, and classrooms will not be safe. Reducing staffing time for the lowest
earners in the district will have the least impact on the budget, yet the biggest impact
on students.
• Courtney Sawyer has been a paraeducator at Geneva Elementary School for 18 years
and has been in education for 35 years. She has been talking with classified staff
across the district who will be losing health insurance for their family, will potentially
qualify for food stamps and will not be able to pay for their homes. It’s atrocious and

•

ironic that the district promotes healthy food and lifestyles, yet the staff impacted by a
reduction in hours will see a negative impact on their overall wellness. What about
directors, supervisors and superintendents? Some people in her school will be losing
nearly half of their paycheck.
Libby Chenault has worked at Carl Cozier Elementary for seven years in Life Skills.
She has heard that no paraeducators will be losing their job, but many will see a
reduction in hours, which will necessitate them finding a second job. The district is
eroding the ability for staff to do their work. Team building and relationship building
takes place before school, after school and in the breakroom with other staff. If staff
feel rushed, they will be unsafe and may sustain back and knee injuries. Safety in
escalated situations takes time, and time and teamwork make a difference. Students
will lose opportunities to grow. Please consider full days for paraeducators.
Elisabeth Epperson is a paraeducator in the Special Education program working at
Roosevelt Elementary School. Her children attend Alderwood Elementary School.
She is disappointed that one person’s time is valued less than another’s. She is proud
of the work that she does and asked everyone to consider the value of time. Your
time, our time, time that families take to prepare their children for school. Does it
make sense to cut paraeducator time when they are the first people that students look
to when they need support?
Avery Catlin is a student at Bellingham High School and the president of the Gay
Straight Alliance (GSA) Club. She is concerned about the delay in turning the art hall
restrooms into gender neutral restrooms. She has seen students struggle with who
they are inside, and being a teenager is difficult. Please provide the needed specific
locks that will enable the change to occur so students can feel safe at school. She can
be reached via email. She also offered her support to the staff who are struggling due
to budget reductions.
Tania Quijada Flores is the president of the Bellingham Association of School
Employees (BASE) and a paraeducator at Carl Cozier Elementary School. Last month
she focused on student safety and ran out of time when she was addressing the board.
This month she would like to talk about financial stability. The decrease from 6.5 to
5.75 hours per day is an 11% decrease in net pay. Many staff are also seeing increases
in their rent and are faced with deciding whether keeping their paraeducator position
will allow them to keep a roof over their head. They need to decide if they continue to
work with the students that they love or find a job elsewhere. For those who choose to
stay, it means additional anxiety and stress, doing more with less and less. Many
BASE members are here this evening to tell their stories. She does not claim to have
an easy solution but asked that the staffing decisions be reconsidered.
Ashley McKale is a Special Education teacher at Carl Cozier Elementary School. The
staff cuts will directly affect the students, and those who work the closest with
students are paid the least and will be looking at making less money next year. This
sheds light on our district’s leaders and does not bode well for inclusionary practices.
Students will not have the familiar staff as support next year and the back slide in
skills will necessitate more support. All staff members need more time to collaborate,
not less. If paraeducators are not on contract when students arrive and depart, how
will students receive the services they need? We need to do better.

Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Dr. Baker thanked staff and students for attending this evening. He noted that
everyone is welcome to stay for the remainder of the meeting but understands that
some may need to leave.
• Our district, along with many others across the state and country, are working to
make adjustments based on the budget that we’ve been given. It’s a very challenging
time. The legislature has finished its session and now there is analysis at the state
level to decide the impact of the bills that were recently passed. Staffing reduction
notifications have continued, although there are still many unknown factors related to
the budget. Districts are in a position of having to make assumptions without having
all of the facts. We are attempting to minimize the impacts of less funding as much as
we can.
• Our staff continue to do amazing work to support kids. Recent events include a Youth
Employment and Local College Fair attended by students, families, higher education
and businesses. Bellingham High School students recently held a food drive. They
collected food, then formed a line from the BHS commons to the Bellingham Food
Bank and passed the food from the school to the food bank to help our community.
Roots of Empathy has been facilitating observation and interaction of our students
with babies and toddlers, along with their families, to help demonstrate empathy.
Next week there will be a community event at Sehome High School focused on media
literacy. The Whatcom Youth Pride Parade will be June 3, and everyone in the
community is welcome to participate. Staff across the district were recognized last
week during staff appreciation week. The Communications and Community Relations
team was recently recognized for several of their publications, including the annual
budget book, Promise Awards video and Promise stories.
• The 2023-24 calendar is being finalized. The first day of school has been changed
from Wednesday, Aug. 30 to Thursday, Aug. 31, which will enable additional time
for staff development. There will be some adjustments to the early dismissal
schedule.
• Graduation ceremonies are coming soon. The Community Transitions ceremony at
Depot Market Square is scheduled for June 8, and the four high school ceremonies
will be held at Civic Field on June 10, beginning at 10 a.m.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Mr. Benjamin enjoyed the recent Whatcom Middle School visit. Art teacher Mr.
Heimer showed artwork from recycled plastics, which was interesting, and the
interactions with students were great. The Special Education board linkage was eye
opening, and he finds it difficult to be in a position of cutting paraeducator time when
there was a clear message about how valuable paraeducators are to families. He will
be attending an all-day WSSDA meeting in Spokane on Saturday.
• Ms. Mason thought the Special Education linkage was fantastic. She appreciated
hearing about the families’ experiences and thinks it’s like seeing into her future. She
heard gratitude for the inclusionary work this district is doing. The visit to Whatcom
was fun, and she’d like to join their clubs. She hopes there is value in clubs that are
more traditionally feminine. She appreciates that the district plays a big part in the
Whatcom Youth Pride Parade. It’s powerful to hear how important that is to students
in our community.
• Ms. Bashaw enjoyed hearing the insight of the parents who attended the Special
Education linkage and wishes more families could have been there. She heard how
difficult the transition from high school is for students and their families. She liked
4

5.2

the visit to Whatcom Middle School and was impressed that students showed up so
early to participate. She is blown away by the clubs that are available to students.
• Ms. Rose thought the visit to Whatcom Middle School was fantastic. The need for
paraeducators was heard loud and clear at the Special Education linkage. She liked
hearing from parents how hard they advocate for their students but knows there are
many parents who are not able to be such strong advocates, which is heartbreaking.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler agrees with the other board members’ impressions of the visit to
Whatcom Middle School and the Special Education linkage. She attended the
Bellingham Public Schools Foundation fundraising lunch, which was very nice. She
understands the hard work and decisions that the executive team has been dealing
with and thanked them for the care that goes into the hard decisions,

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The board is pleased to see graduation rates improve in some groups, especially with the
difficulties that COVID brought. We are also pleased to see that less Bellingham students need
remedial classes in college. Last of all, we also note the rise in female students in both CTE and
STEM courses.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
The board is interested in more data post-COVID so we can get a more accurate measure of
progress. We recognize that a lot of work has been done to improve graduation rates; however,
we would like to see additional improvement among all student groups. In future reports, the
board would be interested to see graduation data comparisons with the state and comparable
districts for our students in a 7-year cohort.
4. Comments on the report itself.
The board appreciates the meaningful data sets that were presented in a cogent and
understandable way. This is very helpful for us all. The only improvement would be if it could be
easily accessible with the report, so the page numbers would be aligned for reading on an
electronic device.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• Annual calendar includes built in time for job-alike professional learning.
• Decrease of 76% in the number of absences for professional development.
• Increase in the number of interpreters for student conferences. BSD has over 50 interpreters
and contracts with several language agencies to be able to access phone and video
interpretation for up to 70 languages.
• ParentSquare, BSD’s new parent notification platform.
DB:
• The report shows great care in considering and incorporating the needs of many district
beneficiaries, from organized labor to families and community needs, around a multitude of
complex factors. These include holidays, weather, breaks and staff development.
• The report shows evidence of creating ample time and opportunity for professional
development. This has also included a dramatic reduction in staff absences over recent years.
• As is usual for this superintendent and his communications team, there is outstanding
evidence of broad communications over multiple channels out to the district and community
regarding the school calendar.
CDH:
• One of the most impressive decisions was the one to develop intentional time for student and
family engagement. The continued use of virtual conferencing seems like it honors families in
many different ways.

Work to use professional learning opportunities to enhance culturally responsive and inclusive
teaching practices.
Work to increase size of substitute pool to help with shortages.
Using lessons from COVID to enhance community engagement practices.
ParentSquare has been a great, new, additional way to communicate with families.
Generally, a lot of creativity as we returned to a more normal school year after COVID,
dealing with both the challenges and learnings that arose from the pandemic.
Report shows great level of care and consideration in developing a calendar that meets a
plethora of requirements for such a diverse range of stakeholders.
Efforts like interpreters and multi-channel communications demonstrate a willingness to meet
stakeholders where they’re at and show commitment to inclusion of families and stakeholders
in addition to students.
Reduction in staff absences and participation in training.
