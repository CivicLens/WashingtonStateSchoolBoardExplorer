WSSDA Conference Debrief
Dr. McSheehy invited those who attended the conference to offer their comments.
Noted that all four newly elected board members received OPMA Training at the

• Kora Murphy
Said it was wonderful to hear what out students were doing and figured out
some things they wanted to do at VHS.
• Nora LaVigueur
Mentioned that instead of giving their own input on the Student Advisory
Board advisory vote, they will now take the first read back to the students,
host a forum somehow and vote via what the student body suggests.
• Juniper Rogneby
Appreciated going to the panel, being around strong and dynamic leaders and
hearing from their experience was very valuable. Hearing from other board
members in the state about how they do things sparked curiosity and
questions.
• Kaycie Alanis
Awesome opportunity to meet other folks from different districts, see how they
do things, how to structure various programs, what works, what doesn’t, and
what can be brought back to Vashon. Biggest takeaway is the abundance of
resources for best practices.
• Lucia Armenta
Enjoyed seeing people that are all in the same space and having different
experiences. Eye opening to see how things work and how everyone makes it
all work. Enjoyed learning the ideas other people have, was very educational
and humbling.
2024 Proposition No. 1 Safety, Security, and Technology Improvements Levy
Update
Dr. McSheehy noted that the upcoming 2024 Levy is filed with King County Elections.
Craig Klinkam is head of the Yes for Kids Committee. No con committee has been
appointed. King County puts it out to the state. VISD has not had a local con committee
in the past two levy elections, but two have been appointed from the state. Upcoming
dates:
• Jan. 24: Voter’s Pamphlets mailed
• Feb. 13: Election Date

•

Feb. 23: Election is certified

Allison Krutsinger noted that mobilization and engagement is very important. Was taken
aback by how many school levies and bonds were not successful in the November 2023
general election.
Dr. McSheehy noted the proposed levy represents approximately 7 percent of the VISD
operating budget.
Upcoming Events
• December 18 – January 1: Winter Break
• January 11: Originally scheduled board work session. WSSDA had conflicts on

Kaycie noted WSSDA Training is because the board contains so many new
members.
• January 15: MLK Day (No School)
• January 25: Regular Board Meeting

Board Member Remarks

Martha Woodard
Pointed out historic nature of all-female board, including student board. Remembered
the days when women were by law second-class citizens. Pleasured to see that
change. Excited and delighted to be working with her fellow board members. Thanked
Vashon community for the opportunity.
Lucia Armenta
Welcomed new board members and thanked them for their work and campaigning.

Excited to be sitting on the board. Has thought about joining/running for many years.
Seems like an exciting opportunity to be on board with folks for different perspectives.
Allison Krutsinger
Echoed welcome to new board members. Repeated remarks about focusing on
mobilization and engagement for levy.
Juniper Rogneby
Heartened to have moved SAB to the center of the table, feels meaningful because the
work is meaningless without true student voice at the table. Welcomes community input.
Cannot promise to take every grievance as their own, but can promise to listen. Noted
board works for the community, and open communication is important. Appreciated the
vote of confidence the community placed in them.
