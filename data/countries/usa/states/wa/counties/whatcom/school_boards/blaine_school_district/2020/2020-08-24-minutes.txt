Mr. Ellis commented on the challenge of teaching math in a new way to increase student success in that area. Blaine High School will transition to a seven-period day in 2021-2022 which will open up more scheduling flexibility, allowing students to take advantage of increased CTE offerings. Planned action steps were summarized for making progress in these goal areas.

He reviewed the middle school's mission statement and commented on its applicability to the online community.

Progress monitoring for ELA and Math was described. Action steps were reviewed, including anticipated challenges such as student use of tools at home and fidelity of experience while learning at home. Classroom culture in an online learning model is another challenge and the middle school's focus will be placed on providing a secure and predictable learning environment for all students.
