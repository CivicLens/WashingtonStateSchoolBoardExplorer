K-12 principal Amy Cox reported on elementary and middle/high school activities. For the next meeting Mrs. Cox will combine the reports into one report as we move toward being a K-12 unified district. Safety has been a focus. The fence has been completed and will deter the public from walking through the middle of campus during the school day often when students are out on the playground. We will be adding a few more cameras to make sure all areas are covered around the buildings and playground.  The year has gotten off to a great start and the culture of the school has been very positive. PTSO paid for all of the school supplies for the elementary students this year. There was an open house for the entire district which was very well received especially by the 6th grade parents and students. 8th grade students showed 6th graders around to the classrooms and giving them some tips so they feel more comfortable moving up to middle school. Professional development continues to be a focus. Elementary teachers will continue to focus on reading and the work that was started this past year.

Mr. Wheatley highlighted the work Sarah Reser is doing with our students by making sure our students are on track who may be credit deficient along with helping students select a graduation pathway. Communication continues to be a key focus. The website has been updated with the revised strategic plan and district organizational chart. Our first Key Communicators meeting will be Friday, September 27th at noon. Rick Maloney will be available on October 2nd and December 4th to begin our work on policy governance.
