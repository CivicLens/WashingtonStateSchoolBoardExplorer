Exactly how many attempted shootings, how many assaulted kids, how many suicides will it take for you to do something helpful? Police involvement in
schools hasn't been proven to be effective, fear-mongering and shame aren't either. And clearly ignoring it doesn't make it go away.
These kids deserve to be treated with compassion and empathy, to be seen as people, and have their physical and mental well-being matter in their schools.
Kids who receive support, who have access to the tools to manage issues, and adults that understand *how* to respond when there's an issue, are what
helps. Kids who have a safe place to learn, where threats of violence aren't a regular occurance, do better.
We cannot respond to angry kids with anger, and then expect their behavior to change. They're learning how to be people, for god's sake, give them some
grace. Approach them as someone with a problem, not someone who *is* a problem. Actually work with experts in child development and psychology,
not more cops. Train staff on ways to respond to peer-to-peer violence that don't make things worse for the victims. Don't give victims the same
punishment as their bullies, and don't reward bullies for stopping for a week or two.
I recognize this is difficult, but as someone who went through this school system, I can't say that I trust my child's life and well-being actually matter to the
district at large, and that's primarily because of the problems listed here. I know I'm not alone in this. Something needs to give, and we shouldn't be sitting
around waiting for it to be the students in our care. It should be us, it should be the desire for things to get better overcoming the discomfort of change.
