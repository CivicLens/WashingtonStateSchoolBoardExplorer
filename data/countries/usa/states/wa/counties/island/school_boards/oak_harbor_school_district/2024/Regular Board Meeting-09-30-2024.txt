Facilities & Maintenance Director Brian Hunt will recognize Vic Rikard, Student Union Building Coordinator.
Memo from Brian Hunt:
The Student Union Building is currently the largest event venue on Whidbey Island and has become a true cornerstone of this
community. With this building, OHPS has hosted concerts, drama performances, beauty pageants, church meetings, memorial
services, and many other types of events. Nearly 100% of our community has used this area at one time or another, and it
represents one of the strongest connections between OHPS and our town.

Vic Rikard is front and center at nearly all of these events. Making sure that the experience is a positive and safe one for all. He
does everything from set up for the events to running lights and sound. Afterward, he and his team will make sure that the space
is clean and ready for either the next event or for school the following day. This often requires him to change his working hours to
accommodate a group, or to be available for preparation, which he does with no complaint or drama.
He expertly operates the systems that are used for events. This includes the sound system, lighting system, bleachers,
ventilation, and anything else needed at the time.

Additionally, Vic is a member of the OHHS Custodial team and professionally maintains our buildings cleanliness and daily
maintenance. He has also become a recognized expert in the entire buildings operations and can solve almost any problem that
may arise. This knowledge and dedication to his work have made him a leader in the training of new custodians, where he
makes a great first impression on new employees.
Although his job has a very high level of visibility, his attitude remains humble, but with a can-do confidence that inspires and
motivates those around him. Vic daily models the OHPS strategic plan foundation of creating strong community partnerships and
is an outstanding representative of the High School and the entire district.
Please join me in saluting his selfless and unending service to others.
