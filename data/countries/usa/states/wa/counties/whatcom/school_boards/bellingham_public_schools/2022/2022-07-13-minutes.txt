School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Mr. Benjamin shared that he will be speaking at the Bellingham Bay Rotary Club in
August. He thanked Ms. Bashaw and Dr. Baker for the decision to move this
evening’s meeting online, and he hopes that things will get back to normal soon.
• Ms. Mason noted that graduation was amazing, and she was happy that the
ceremonies were able to be outside in the beautiful weather. She knows that it took a
lot of coordination behind the scenes for the ceremonies to go so well, and
graduations are a good reminder of the work that we do in preparing students for their
futures. She also recognized and expressed appreciation for district staff who have
had to manage extra calls and emails related to Ms. Mason’s private, which is not
related to her role as a school board member.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler attended the graduation at Bellingham High and spoke about the
seniors bringing the principal signed ping pong balls as a prank during the ceremony.
Ms. Diaz Hackler later gifted the principal with ping pong paddles. She shared that
she was able to pick up some bricks from the old Sunnyland Elementary building that
is being demolished as a part of the school’s new rebuild.
• Ms. Bashaw attended graduation ceremonies for Community Transitions and Options
High School. She shared that the Community Transitions celebration was very
special, but unfortunately there was rain that evening. She was happy that the weather
cooperated for the Options High School ceremony. She acknowledged gratitude for
the staff who had a long day of graduation celebrations.

public health emergency to meet the need for organizational continuity.

with the larger community during an extended and unpredictable public health emergency.
The board is impressed with the increased number of meetings held with school administrators
during the pandemic.
As in previous years, the superintendent continues to upgrade safety and security capital
improvement for schools. That is very important in this day and age.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
During the summer months of 2020, more than 17,000 books were mailed to 1,400 students at all
14 of our elementary schools. Each student participating received an average of 12 books each.
The district appears to be approaching the point where you cannot distinguish between students of
various ethnic and socio-economic status by their graduation rates. This is significant progress
towards a very high bar.
The board continues to be impressed with all the creativity during the pandemic. A virtual middle
school concert has got to be one of the highlights of the year. Not just for the young musician, but
for their family as well.
Continued increase in graduation rates *and* an increase in CTE certifications. Bravo.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
Continued work on the Bellingham Promise.
