All Posts District News Cedarcrest High School Cherry Valley Elementary More Search Nov 5, 2021 A Statement from the Riverview School Board of Directors - November 5, 2021 The Riverview School Board of Directors continues to work directly with district personnel to address the issue of racism; overt and hidden, individual, and institutional. Riverview strives to be a place of equity and inclusion. We are committed to providing a culture of equity, access, recognition, and belonging for all students. We also acknowledge that there is more work to be done. Schools have a profound influence in shaping the future of our society. Public schools alone, however, cannot produce the societal changes that are desperately needed to protect our students from social injustice. As a community, we must collaboratively do our part to serve each and every student responsibly. We are firmly committed to advocating for all students, standing up for justice, closing the cultural divide, and further understanding the needs of our marginalized communities. On August 10, 2021, the School Board of Directors adopted Policy 3001 Equity and Access for All Students. As this is a new policy, the Superintendent or designee is responsible for developing procedures to implement this policy, including an action plan. These words are only a starting point. We can and must do better in our community and persist in making this current commitment to do so a permanent one.
