It is recommended that the Board of Directors approve
the updated 23-24 Professional-Technical Employees'
Compensation Schedule

Public Content
Information: Professional-Technical Employees' Compensation Schedule
Background:This is the updated 23-24 compensation schedule for Edmonds Professional-Technical
Employees. In our meet and confer process with the Professional-Technical group for the 22-24
Memorandum of Understanding, we committed to completing a full salary study for all positions in the
group. We finalized the process in January and the results were approved by the Professional-Technical
group.
The new schedule reflects the district's ongoing commitment to provide compensation at least at the
midpoint of compensation in other districts for similar positions. In the past, Professional-Technical
employees received the same annual midpoint adjustment as our Principals group. Our salary study
showed that this practice did not keep our compensation competitive with other districts' ProfessionalTechnical compensation. While some of our positions were at or above the midpoint for like positions in
other districts, many positions were below with some being as far as 24% below midpoint. This
compensation schedule better aligns our Professional-Technical employees' pay with other regional
school districts.
This schedule is effective September 1, 2023 and employees will be given retroactive pay to account for
this.

Information: Agreement with Shrub Oak International School for residential special education services.
Background:
This agreement provides an alternative residential placement for a student with disabilities for the 2023-2024 school year. This is an OSPI
approved out-of-state non-public agency. A non-public agency (NPA) is an entity authorized by OSPI under Chapter 28A.300 RCW to
contract with a school district to provide a program of special education services for students whose special education needs cannot be met
by their resident school district. An approved NPA provides the student's special education and related services determined necessary for
Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) through the individualized education program (IEP) process. The district will apply for state
safety net reimbursement for this placement. One student is expected to require services for a pro-rated total of $467,773 (which covers
between now and August 2024). The Safety Net that will be applied for will be the total cost of the program minus Washington States set
Safety Net threshold for the districts expenses per student of $39,158. As a reminder, all placement decisions and services are determined
by a students IEP team.

Information:

Second Reading, Approve Revised Board Policy 3110- Qualification of Attendance and Placement
Background:
We are proposing a change to the Early Entrance Policy 3110- Qualification of Attendance & Placement.
The current language says, An early entrance candidate for kindergarten or first grade is defined as a
child whose fifth birthday (kinder) or sixth birthday (first) falls between (and includes) September 1 and
December 31. We would like to change the end date from December 31st to October 31st.
The rationale for the change is that this would create congruence with neighboring districts and reduce
administrative costs. Only one student in 5 years of data who has had a birthday between 10/31 and 12
/31 has successfully tested in.
There were no changes between the first and second reading.

On Saturday, January 13th , Edmonds staff discovered significant water damage/standing water at
