Center Consortium. The last district admitted to the consortium (approximately 17 years ago) was
Edmonds School District. Superintendents of districts who belong to the consortium discussed and
recommended that Stanwood-Camano be included in this consortium. Their admittance does not impact
Edmonds students' spaces available in the program.
In order to admit the new district, each of the existing districts' boards must pass a resolution to admit
Stanwood-Camano.
