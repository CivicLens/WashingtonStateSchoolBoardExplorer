academic supports & personalization of learning plans.
Fisher Elementary is incorporating US History into their music lessons. The folk dance "The Boston Tea Party" is an engaging
way for 5th graders to connect with the history of the American Revolution through movement. This hands-on experience
helps students gain a deeper understanding of this historical event and brings history to life!
Lynden Academy K-5 students attended their first field trip of the year to Hovander Park and Tennant Lake in Ferndale. It was

Speakers will be recognized by the Board president at the time they are to speak. Each speaker has a maximum of five minutes. It is
important for community members to feel welcome and safe during the meeting. Board members listen and learn from public
comment, but generally will not respond. Topics raised during public comment may receive a follow up from a board member or the
superintendent at a later date as appropriate. The school board does not take public comments on issues related to personnel or
individually named staff members. The presiding officer of the board reserves the right to terminate an individual's statement when
the allotted time has passed and may interrupt a speaker to require the same standard of civility as the board imposes on itself as
specified in Board Policy 1400.
