Explanation of Issue: Approval of Whatcom County Contract for Prevention Services
Attached is an agreement between Whatcom County and the District for Prevention Services. This
contract allows the county to provide funding to the school district for promoting increased support for
students who are challenged by mental health and substance abuse problems. Assistant Superintendent,
Ron Cowan, has reviewed this contract and recommends moving forward with it. The contract is for
March 1, 2010 through August 31, 2011.
---------------------------------------------------------TO: Karst Brandsma, Deputy Superintendent
FROM: Kenn Robinson, Director of Student Services
DATE: January 29, 2010
SUBJECT: Whatcom County Contract for Prevention Services
Attached is a contract between Whatcom County and the Bellingham School District. This contract allows
the county to provide funding to the school district for promoting increased support for students who are
challenged by mental health and substance abuse problems. Last year the Whatcom County Council
approved a one-tenth of one percent increase in the sales tax to collect funds in order to increase
services in the county. The Bellingham School District began meeting with the county health department
in November of last year to construct the framework for these funds.
This contract represents the conclusion of our joint efforts in establishing additional prevention support in
our schools. Specifically, we will use the funding to hire and place a prevention/intervention specialist at
Bellingham High School. With this addition, each of our large high schools will have a dedicated
prevention specialist to work with the buildings administrators and counselors to help respond to
increasing drug/alcohol issues at the high schools.
Please review Exhibit A: Scope of Work for a detailed description of the work that is expected as a result
of receiving these funds. The $80,000.00 is available to us now that we may hire a person for the

remainder of this year and for 2010 2011. Upon approval of the contract, I will work with Human
Resources on a job description and initiate the hiring process.
I forward this contract to you for district consideration and recommend that we accept the contract and
funding it provides. I am available to respond to your questions.
