Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulgáb).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time immemorial and their
ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice the traditional ways of their
ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural traditions passed on to them by their
ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its Indigenous people,
as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history, and can
demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.

Public Content
Submitted by:
Kari Henderson-Burke, Executive Director of Teaching & Learning; and
Colleen Van Belle, Principal of Kent Prairie Elementary
Background Information:
Outdoor Schools Washington has given grants to each elementary school for our 5th graders to attend a three-day/two-night field trip.
House Bill 2078 states that "[t]he legislature finds that time outdoors helps children thrive physically, emotionally, and academically, yet over
the past few generations, childhood has moved indoors. On average, today's kids spend up to 44 hours per week in front of a screen, and
less than 10 minutes a day doing activities outdoors. For too many kids, access to the outdoors is determined by race, income, ability, and
zip code. All children deserve equitable access to outdoor spaces where they can learn, play, and grow, but current access to outdoor
educational opportunities is inequitable." It further states that "[t]he purpose of the outdoor education experiences program is to develop and
support outdoor learning opportunities for 5th and 6th grade students in Washington public schools, with related opportunities for high school
students to volunteer as counselors. The program will consist of hands-on learning experiences that: Are three to five days in duration and
up to four nights; are residential or day programs; and have a focus on environmental education aligned with the Washington state learning
standards and the development of social and emotional learning skills."
Administrative Considerations:

That the Board approves theOutdoor Schools Washington grants.
Budgetary Impact:

The four grants total $149,625 that will cover all of the 5th-grade students to attend the field trip.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:

The grants must be accepted by September 1, 2024.

Background Information:
Board policy does not require Board approval for staff travel overnight within the state, however, because students will be
traveling with the Board, we are following the protocol for student travel out-of-district overnight, which requires Board approval.
The Washington State School Directors' Association (WSSDA) is the Board's association. WSSDAholds an annual conference in
November each year, where important professional development is offered in addition to opportunities for the Board to network
with other School Board members across the state.

Administrative Considerations:
This year, the conference is being held in Spokane, WA. The Board, Superintendent, Executive Assistant and students will travel
to Bellevue on Thursday, November 21 and return on Saturday, November 23.
During the pre-conference on Thursday, Dr. Sweeting, new Board member(s) and our new Student Advisor will attend a Boot
Camp session. Our existing Student Advisor may opt to attend Boot Camp or another workshop.
Budgetary Impact:
The estimated cost for the conference and travel expenses is $12,562.80and will be covered by the Board budget.
