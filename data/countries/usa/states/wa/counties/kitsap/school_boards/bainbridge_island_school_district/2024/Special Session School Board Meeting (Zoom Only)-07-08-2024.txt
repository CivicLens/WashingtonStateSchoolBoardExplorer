To: Amii Thompson, Superintendent
From: Dane Fenwick, Director of Facilities and Operations
Re: Bainbridge Island Educational Support Professional Association Collective Bargaining Agreement
The Bainbridge Island School District (BISD) recently completed collective bargaining with the Bainbridge Island Educational
Support Professional Association (BIESPA) on Thursday, June 13th, 2024. On Friday, June 28, 2024 we received notification
from BIESPA that their membership had voted to approve the agreement. The BISD and BIESPA bargaining teams worked
collaboratively to agree on multiple topics, share concerns, identify common and shared interests, and find solutions that
satisfied the needs of both BIESPA and BISD.
Listed below are key components of the agreement:
The agreement will be in effect for two years, September 1, 2024 - August 31, 2026.
Time on assignment and preparatory work hours for paraeducators prior to the start of school was clarified and agreed
upon.
Language pertaining to holidays and vacation accrual was clarified and agreed upon in recognition of school year and fulltime staff.
We will create a new step on the wage scale that incorporates and consolidates Elementary/Intermediate/Middle School
head custodians resulting in a 1.7 percent increase for Elementary head custodians while providing consistency and
uniformity within the scale.
The agreement provides for classified staff represented by BIESPA to receive a wage increase based on the state
inflationary adjustment factor or (IPD) plus 1.5 percent for the 2024-2025 school year; and
A wage increase based on the state inflationary adjustment factor or (IPD) plus 2 percent for the 2025-2026 school year.
I recommend Board approval of the amended Bainbridge Island School District / Bainbridge Island Educational Support
Professional Association 2024 - 2026 Collective Bargaining Agreement.

Re: Payment Agreement, City of Bainbridge Island (Danas Trail Completion)
__________________________________________________________________

The Bainbridge Island School District Capital Projects department in coordination with engineers from the City of Bainbridge
Island, has completed Danas trail through the central campus connecting (5) district schools via safe walking and biking routes.
The original scope of the project was created to provide safe mobility for all students and community members through the
shared parking lot of the BISD Administration building, Aquatic Center, and the central campus schools. After collaboration with
the City and Squeaky Wheels Organization, the scope of work was enhanced to provide all ages and abilities surfaces, 8 wide
sidewalks, speed thresholds, and additional signage.
I am requesting approval of the attached Payment agreement and authorization for the district administration to enter the
agreement with the City on July 9, 2024.
