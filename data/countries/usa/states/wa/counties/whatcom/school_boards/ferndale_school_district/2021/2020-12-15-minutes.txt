Information: 6.02 Receive the Monitoring Report for Operational Expectations Policy 8
(OE-8) Communication with the Board
Mr. McLaurin reminded audience members that the Board began transitioning to
a coherent governance model four years ago. He said three years ago, we
developed and adopted about 40 governance policies in four categories:
Governance Culture Policies, Board Superintendent Relations Policies,
Operational Expectations policies and Results policies. Mr. McLaurin briefly
explained the types of policies. He said the board regularly monitors how the
Superintendent and her team are implementing their policies. The Board asks the
Superintendent to provide them with Monitoring Reports on each of the
Operational Expectations and Results Policies according to a pre-arranged
schedule. However, when the pandemic forced to close down all in-person
learning and reinvent school overnight, the Board gave permission to pause
those Monitoring Reports. Tonight, we are resuming that part of our operations.
Dr. Quinn presented the monitoring report for OE-8 Communication with the
Board, which is attached to BoardDocs. A hard copy of the monitoring report
will be delivered to the board members. The Board will review the monitoring
report and bring it to discussion at the board meeting on January 26.
