The special joint board meeting held on May 2, 2024, for the Port Townsend School District No. 50 and Chimacum School District No. 49 focused on several key reports and potential policy changes. The Transportation Director, Monica Mulligan, proposed a change to the bell schedule for Port Townsend schools for the 2025-26 school year, aiming to improve efficiency in student transportation and reduce ride times for younger students. This proposal, which includes reversing the order of afternoon pick-ups, was discussed in light of ongoing staff shortages in the transportation department, highlighting recruitment challenges for bus drivers. 

Additionally, the Athletic Director, Shelby Box, presented the Title IX/Athletic Program report, noting a significant increase in student participation in athletics across both districts, with 93 athletes in Chimacum and 184 in Port Townsend. The boards approved the Athletic Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and the Transportation Interlocal Agreement, indicating a commitment to collaboration between the districts. Community engagement was evident as public comments included support for the proposed changes and a suggestion for greater transparency in the athletic budget. The meeting concluded with plans for future joint gatherings and a scheduled review of reports in May 2025.
