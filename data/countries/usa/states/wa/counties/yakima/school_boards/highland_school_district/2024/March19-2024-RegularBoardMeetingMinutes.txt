we were last year then too. Transportation is down to $155K as we recently bought a bus. Bus prices
have risen so much that this is not enough to buy another. We’d like the Board to consider purchasing
another van. Even though enrollment is down, it is great that we have so many students turning out for
extra-curricular programs and another van would help with smaller group transportation.
Enrollment: Last month we had a net gain of five students, resulting in an FTE of 1,031 K-12. Mark
shared information from an enrollment projection chart. If current kindergarten enrollment numbers stay
about the same, our enrollment will be below 1,000 in two years and just above 800 by the 2028-2029
school year, which equates to a $1.5m budget cut. This is why we must be very careful with our budget
now and going forward. Many factors are involved in the decreasing enrollment that is happening pretty
much everywhere.
b. Personnel Report: Mark: There isn’t much to report. We have posted for an EL/Migrant paraeducator for this year only due to an increase in enrollment of students that need those services. Cesar
Dominguez is presented to teach a Cybersecurity class out-of-endorsement with a support plan. Carlos
moved, 2nd by David to approve the Personnel Report as presented; motion carried.
c. Legislative Report: Cindy: The session is done and nothing major came out of it that affects us. No
real bad news and no real good news.
e. Payment of Bills-General, ASB, Capital Projects, Transportation, and Payroll: The Board had
reviewed the warrants, there were no questions. David moved to pay the General Fund, ASB, Capital
Projects, and Payroll as presented, Lupita 2nd; motion passed.
• General Fund bills for $265,252.89 with warrants 78057 through 78160.
• ASB Fund bills for $31,179.05 with warrants 7047 through 7063.
• Capital Project bills for $26,779.53 with warrants 737 through 739.
• Payroll Fund bills for $265,562.15 with warrants 78161 through 78178 and $1,049,524.44 by
direct deposit.
6. CALENDAR OF EVENTS:
March: There are half-days coming up for grading and the week of conferences, followed by Spring
Break, April 1-5. The AM board meeting will be on April 8 and the PM meeting on the 18th. We host
the WSSDA Regional Meeting on Wednesday, April 19 at which we will have the opportunity to
showcase the district. We received notice from OPSI about results from the Washington School
Improvement Framework: MWC, TES, and HHS are ‘Foundational’ and HMS is Tier 1-2, meaning
there is a subgroup or two that is low producing. We are proud of what we’ve done and it is good news
overall.
