  3. Reports
A. School Administrator Reports
Each school administrator provided a brief report to the board. Director McKinney asked what particular areas are the focus for improvement. She also asked about attendance now that we're getting closer to the holidays. Work done by the K-5 Dean and SEL paraeducators has helped to address the challenges of students returning to the in-person school environment, and attendance has been good. President Gibson asked for additional information about the critical thinking component of the Primary School's Number Corner and discussion continued. Discipline issues were discussed, and Mr. VanderYacht explained how the elementary school's morning meetings have been utilized to build relationships and understanding. Director Thomas asked about the shortage of substitutes and the issue was discussed. Mr. Benson described the positive feedback from attendees at the music concert on November 4. Director McKinney suggested setting up a system to survey parents after conferences to get feedback on their experience. President Gibson asked about AVID work at the high school and Mr. Ellis shared positive comments about the school's new AVID teacher. He looks forward to the time when students can again report to the board.
  B. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment for the month of November which went down from last month. It is difficult to predict how the rest of the year will go.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of October. Ms. Porter explained the district's efforts to increase cash and investment balances as much as possible to be well-prepared for any future shortfalls.

The board was asked to hold a special meeting to adopt a resolution to adjust the levy collection amount in the district's budget for the General Fund. The amount in the budget is lower than the district's levy authority, so the adjustment would increase the district's levy revenue but remains lower than the levy amount approved by voters.
  D. WSSDA Conference Report
Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger and President Gibson recently attended the annual WSSDA conference in Bellevue and shared a summary of the information learned. Dr. Granger provided an overview about the Law Conference and keynote speakers. President Gibson commented on the Law Conference attorney who reiterated that the school board doesn't have the kind of local control that people believe they have. Schools are subject to many complex factors ranging from the local health authority to labor unions. Mr. Gibson expressed appreciation for Dr. Granger's leadership through this complex and challenging time.
  E. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
He expressed appreciation for all department and campus leaders who assisted with the emergency weather situation on Monday, November 15. The leadership team worked together in the decision-making process, starting early in the morning.
Upcoming meetings were reviewed. The board's regular meeting next month is at noon on December 14. There will be an abbreviated agenda with no campus reports. Newly elected and re-elected directors will be sworn in, and the board officer positions will be reorganized. An additional meeting will need to be scheduled to continue the redistricting discussion. The board and superintendent will meet in executive session on January 12, 2022 for the superintendent's annual review. Then, the regular meeting will take place on January 24. Pursuant to the board's request in October, a work session needs to be scheduled to review and discuss updates to the 1000 policy series.
The next legislative session starts in January. It will be a short session because it's a non-budget year. The combined WSSDA/WASA platform asks the legislature to revisit school funding issues, including fixed transportation funding, fully funded special education, teacher salary schedules, and connectivity issues for families. A statewide loss of $577M in educational funding has resulted from students leaving public education during the pandemic, and this has surfaced the need to revisit funding mechanisms.

The district is working with the City of Blaine on plans to repair and upgrade the fish hatchery and the aquaculture program which has a long-standing history in Blaine. Mr. Vezzetti reviewed current and potential future class offerings, including dual credit opportunities. Upcoming promotion events include CTE Month in February and a job fair in the spring.
