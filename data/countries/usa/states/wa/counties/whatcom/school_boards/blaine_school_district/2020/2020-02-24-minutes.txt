  Minutes
  1. Board Work Session
A. Call to Order
President Gibson opened the work session at 3:20 p.m.
All Directors were in attendance.
     Todd Nunamaker, Dougal Thomas, Joan Lotze, Charles E Gibson, Laura McKinney
  B. Outline of Work Session Objectives
The work session was facilitated by Rich Parker from McPherson & Jacobson who conducted the district's search for a new superintendent in 2019. The purpose of the work session, pursuant to Phase V of the McPherson & Jacobson contract, was to establish performance objectives for the new superintendent. Mr. Parker explained that this type of meeting is typically conducted shortly after the hiring of a new superintendent, but the turnover of directors in the fall of 2019 made it desirable to postpone this session for the benefit of new directors as well.
  C. Discussion of Superintendent Performance Objectives
Rich Parker distributed three handouts for guided discussion. Concepts from a book titled "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team" were referenced in a discussion regarding relationships between board members, between the board and superintendent, and also with the public. These concepts included the areas of trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and collective results. Mr. Parker encouraged the directors to read the full book by Patrick Lencioni.
  There was discussion to clarify the public's role as observers during the board's regular monthly business meeting, which is a time for the board to conduct its own business in view of the public but without engaging the public in discussion. Comments from the public can be heard (without response from the board) during a public comment period. Mr. Parker encouraged the board to begin scheduling two routine meetings each month in order to operate effectively. In addition to the board's regular business meeting, a second monthly meeting could be scheduled to provide an opportunity for engagement with the public on specific topics. In that setting, Mr. Parker suggested the board utilize an informal room arrangement, with intermingled seating and no name plates, to encourage open discussion between directors and patrons. In contrast, Mr. Parker described the format of a public forum for the purpose of hearing public input on a larger (controversial) issue with no interaction and no time limit on comments.

Mr. Parker further commented on the importance of being engaged and committed to the district's business and to avoid being a "rubber-stamping" board. Goal setting methods for the board and for the district were discussed. To establish goals for the board, Mr. Parker encouraged the use of WSSDA's self evaluation tool. Out of that process, three goals for the board should be developed out of the five core principals in WSSDA's School Board Standards. When setting goals for the district, clear public input from the community should be included.

The "Public Problems, Values and Choices" handout was reviewed, and Mr. Parker led the directors in a discussion exercise related to a fictional topic of consideration. Mr. Parker then led a "Decision-Making" activity, using the third handout, which helped clarify the types of decisions that fall under the board's purview.

At 5:15pm, there was a short break and the meeting resumed at 5:20pm.

There was discussion regarding interpersonal relationships between board members and with the superintendent. Relational conflicts or problems should be discussed with either the board chair or superintendent as appropriate.

Mr. Parker directed the board to the district's policies and procedures in BoardDocs and encouraged the directors to become familiar with them, particularly the 1000 series. He also recommended that the directors become familiar with the contents of RCW Chapter 28, the state's laws for schools. He further explained that model policies and procedures provided by WSSDA are written for all Washington districts. But, so long as it does not violate the law, local school boards have the latitude to change, add, or delete any part of the model policy or procedure language to suit the needs of their individual district.

Board officer positions were discussed and Mr. Parker suggested that the district's policy be updated to include the position of WIAA Point of Contact. He also recommended implementing a new position of Policy Representative for the purpose of overseeing policy development.

Superintendent evaluation protocols were discussed. Mr. Parker expressed a preference for the use of performance based evaluation methods rather than standards based evaluations.

The board's responsibility for hiring personnel was discussed, and Mr. Parker explained the directors' liability for insuring that appropriate background checks are done. Protocols for verification were discussed, as well as the value of trust within the organization. Consideration was given to providing additional hiring paperwork for board review prior to acting on approval of hiring recommendations.
  D. Closing Comments
Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger indicated that his detailed work session notes could be made available for review in addition to the meeting minutes.
  Director McKinney inquired about the board's autonomy and power in budgetary matters and discussion followed. She referenced the special education budget which has been significantly over its allocation for the past couple of years. Mr. Parker recommended that the board request special review of this program in order to gain a better understanding of its dynamics, and Dr. Granger commented that a review is currently underway. Discussion continued regarding the funding deficit from the state and the formulas used to calculate the district's allocation of funds for special education students. There was also clarification of special education's historical intent to exit students from programming rather than keep them in a program with lowered expectations.
  2. Adjournment
