Leslie St. Lawrence, teacher at Bernice Vossbeck Elementary, was awarded a $300 mini grant from the Whatcom County School
Retirees' Association- Unit 32. The grant application requested that funds be used for the TK classrooms at Vossbeck and will
be used to purchase needed supplies and materials. Bernice Vossbeck kicked off their I Love to Read month for January 30March 24th. Their goal is to ready 1,500 books as a school!
The staff at Lynden Middle School had an engaging and thought-provoking professional development day on Friday, January
27th. Their theme was "Every Student. Every Day" with a focus on student learning. Staff engaged with Social Emotional
Learning Standards through Character Strong, and learned how the Freckle program meets academic needs of students at
different levels of learning. They also focused on how the WIDA framework and AVID strategies support the learning of all
students.
Lynden High School just wrapped up their first ever "Freshman Blitz"! This was an after-school support program for 9th
graders on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the month of January. It was designed to help them finish their first semester of
high school successfully! Megan Dickson, Brian Miller, Karen Petersen, Isella Skrumbellos and Erin Shaffer did an outstanding
job coordinating the support for over 40 students!
Congratulations to Mrs. Vis' 3rd grade class at Isom Elementary for becoming published authors! They hosted guests for their
Thankful & Blessed book publishing party. This was such an exciting way to celebrate the hard work of making words come to
life! When asked how they had to COOPERATE to accomplish their goal, students shared how classmates worked in groups to
edit their writing, brainstormed title ideas, conducted a class vote to decide who would write the dedication page, and shared
supplies to create illustrations.
