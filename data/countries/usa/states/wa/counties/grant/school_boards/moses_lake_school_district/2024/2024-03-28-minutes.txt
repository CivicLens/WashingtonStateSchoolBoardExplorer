Action: B. Legislative Positions
Monty Sabin shared about the legislative positions. On March 1, 2024 there was a study session to determine important legislative positions for the MLSD Board. These positions are submitted to WSSDA for the legislative rep council to approve or not. They go through a process and then vote on different legislative positions. WSSDA has a number of positions the Board (carved down). Included in the agenda there is a marked up version to show changes as well as a cleaned up version of the position choices. 
If adopted this evening, we submit to WSSDA. The window for submission ends April 8th. Later in April, three WSSDA committees will review these positions.
On each position submitted, WSSDA will take a stance whether they recommend to pass or not to pass the submission. These recommendations will go before the general assembly and each school district will have the opportunity to vote on each of these. The final vote is what determines which positions become permanent positions with WSSDA.
Motion passed unanimously via roll call vote.
  Resolution:  Move to approve the proposal of Legislative Positions to be considered by WSSDA.

Action: C. Policy 3432 Emergencies
Jeremy O'Neil gave a quick synopsis of Policy 3432 Emergencies.
Mr. O'Neil noted in comparison to the existing policy, this is really just a listing of definitions of the drills the district conducts on a routine basis. The revisions add clarity around the management and style of our emergency response planning. Of the definitions of the drills, one is significantly altered to adhere to House Bill 1941, concerning active shooter drills. Active shooter drills will be age appropriate. The district will be prepared and informed, but not put people in situations that are scary.
Ms. Jensen asked a question after reviewing the proposed policy concerning funding. Ms. O'Neil assured her that this was a priority and there should be funding for these drills. She also went on to ask about the verbage "superintendent or designee". It was explained that it is typically Mr. O'Neil or a cabinet member in Mr. Sabin's absence.
Mr. Fuhr noted that because the policy has many "wills" and "shalls" in it, we must make sure we are doing the drills.
Law enforcement is doing training on their own and not involving students and staff any longer like they did 20 years ago.
Mr. Fuhr also asked if the ESD still has a safety officer who helps with planning. Mr. O'Neil noted the current person is retiring, but he feels sure there will be a replacement.
  Presentation: D. CEE Data Celebrations
Carol Lewis presented CEE data concerning staff. She noted a strong correlation between significantly improved data and the work we have been doing with Professional Learning Communities (PLCs). Ms. Lewis stated when looking at data, one wants to assess if it is growth data or achievement data. Both are important. She went on to share how the district's growth and achievement go hand in hand.
She explained that PLC's have three big ideas and showed their gains: Focus on Learning, Creating a Collaborative Culture, and Results Orientation. It also has a real focus on Collective Efficacy, which is the combined belief of educators that students can achieve at high levels and our data showed the most growth among our staff in this area.
Ms. Lewis went on to share the growth indicated in our staff responses.
This voluntary survey is given once a year to staff. We are working to get even more voluntary participation.
  8. Old Business
Action: A. Policy 2415 Performance-Based Pathway for High School Graduation
Ms. Lewis noted Policy 2415 Performance-Based Pathway for High School Graduation. This is another celebration, as we have new state law which is opening more pathways for our students to show they are ready for the world. This is a second reading of the policy presented at the last meeting by Ron Mayberry, our CTE Director.
  Resolution: Move to approve Policy 2415 Performance-Based Pathway for High School Graduation.
  Motion by Paul Hill, second by Amy Breitenstein.
Final Resolution: Motion Passes

9. Information Items
Information: A. Student Board Representatives Report
Elizabeth Diaz's Report
Large Group Festival:  Last Friday, each band within the MLHS Band (Cadet, Concert, and Wind Ensemble) visited Wenatchee High School to attend the annual Large Group Festival. The day started at 6:00 AM and ended at 6:00 PM. Cadet Band performed first, followed by Wind Ensemble and then Concert Band. Other bands, including Quincy and Wenatchee, performed at this festival. Bands perform in front of adjudicators who come on stage and provide feedback on certain parts of the pieces they played. It is a great experience for kids to hear various types of music as well as feedback given to them by individuals they do not know (hearing outside opinions and thoughts can help).
Choir Concert: The choir has a concert on Wednesday.
Keera Michie's Report
Pals Prom: Pals Prom was a huge success! The Pals Club students had a great time dancing, enjoying the Red Carpet themed decorations and the Corn Dog truck hired for the event. Many students from Key Club, Honor Society, or who help in the Peer Mentoring classrooms were also able to attend the dance.  They helped with set up and clean up and helped the Pals Club students have a great experience.
Colors of the World (formerly MECHA): This weekend students from the Colors of the World Club, formerly known as MECHA, are holding a dance fundraiser at Vanguard Academy. There will be food available to purchase.  This will be the first Colors of the World Dance at Vanguard Academy.
CMS Band Concert: Last week I had the opportunity to attend the Columbia Middle School Band Concert under the direction of Mrs. Bower. Each student did an incredible job performing competition festival pieces. The 8th grade band received a top score of a 1+ on their performance at their Festival in Chiawana, competing with other larger band programs around the area. The 7th grade band had to learn 12 pieces in the past month to prepare for festival and also pep band music for school assemblies.  Their performance was a huge success and accomplishment, especially considering the short preparation time these students had.
Track Invitationals: The MLHS Track team has been busy at multiple large track meets the past few weeks. At the Windbreaker Invitational on March 15th in Mattawa the Boys Team took first, with many 1st place finishes, and the Girls Team took 2nd. Last weekend at the Ray Cross Invitational in Ephrata the Boys and Girls teams both took third place overall. They are expecting many more top finishes in their future meets and invitationals.

Information: B. Board Comments
Mr. Hill noted the legislative session has been out for three weeks. He would like to see the district invite some of our legislators.
Ms. Urias wished everyone a Happy Easter
Mr. Breitenstein noted it has been exciting to have student recognitions the last couple of weeks. The presentations from the schools are great. Happy Easter and enjoy spring break.
Mr. Jensen also wished everyone a great spring break.
