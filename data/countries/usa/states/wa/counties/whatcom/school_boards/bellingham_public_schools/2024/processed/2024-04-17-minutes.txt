OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
April 17, 2024 – District Office, 1985 Barkley Blvd., Bellingham, WA.
Call to Order/Land Acknowledgment:
Mr. Benjamin (President) called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. He acknowledged that
this meeting is being held on ancestral homelands of the Lummi people and Nooksack
tribe.
Roll Call:
Present: Directors Douglas Benjamin (President), Camille Diaz Hackler, Scott Ritchey,
Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder). Director Jennifer
Mason was unable to attend the meeting.
Audience:
No public testimony was offered.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Dr. Baker recently met with the state superintendent and a group of superintendents
from across the state. He displayed slides from that meeting showing voter priority
issues in 2023 and 2024. Other information shared included K-12 spending over the
past 10 years, K-12 spending with inflation adjustments and per-pupil state funding
over the past 10 years. The percentage of K-12 education funding in the state’s
operating budget has decreased over time. It’s expected that the best estimate of final
budget numbers will be coming from the state this week, and the district is working to
finalize the 2024-25 budget. It’s expected that 2024-25 will be a “hold steady” year
for the budget, other than salaries. A proposed final budget will be presented to the
board in June or July. Looking further out, the 2025-26 budget year is likely to be
another challenging year, and it’s expected that there will be a lot of advocacy for K12 education funding.
• Promise Awards have been presented over the past two weeks, and Dr. Baker shared
photos of recipients at the award presentations.
• High school students have been participating in exciting competitions, including
music, bridge building and robotics.
• Dr. Baker shared photos from the March 26 CTE school board linkage.
• Registration for Promise K and kindergarten is happening now, with the elementary
schools hosting open houses for future students and families.
• A Since Time Immemorial Family and Community Night will be held 5:30-8 p.m. on
April 24 at Whatcom Community College.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
GP-7.2 – 2023-24 Annual Board Agenda, Revised – general review.
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Since joining the board, Mr. Ritchey has been impressed with the data that has been
presented in the monitoring reports. The CTE linkage was a fantastic event, with a
great introduction by Heather Steele, director of teaching and learning. His takeaway
from the linkage was that CTE is a powerful tool for student engagement. He loved
hearing students talk about applying what they have learned in their CTE classes to
other areas of their lives. The Squalicum High School visit exhibited evidence that
Principal Laurel Peak is doing a great job with student engagement and has created a
sense of belonging for students. At a recent Kulshan Middle School family and
student event, he made cotton candy and was impressed with how Kulshan has
engaged the school community.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler also thought the CTE linkage was awesome. She was seated with
students from the sports medicine program, and it was great to engage with them. The
Squalicum visit was great.
• Mr. Benjamin reminded the board about the April 26 retreat in Friday Harbor, which
coincides with the WSSDA DA-1 regional meeting in Friday Harbor the following
day. He encouraged board members to complete the WSSDA self-assessment this
week so a summary can be obtained from WSSDA for discussion at the retreat. He
had no idea of the extent and scope of the CTE program and he’s very impressed. He
enjoyed the Squalicum visit. He will be attending the exit interview with the state
auditor tomorrow on Teams. The WSSDA board has been meeting weekly in relation
to the search for a new executive director.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
This is an area where year after year the superintendent excels and, frankly, shows “how it should
be done.” This 51-page report shows example after example of effective communication and
outreach to our owners, beneficiaries and other stakeholders. The board not only has the evidence
of this report, but almost daily communications to us containing examples. Of course, there will
be people who feel that if every single detail is not spelled out precisely that something is wrong.
The board is happy with the level of information shared by the superintendent.
The board is very impressed with the strategic partnerships that benefit students and families.
Over $70,000.00 in store cards donated, the donations to the GRADS program and many other
partnerships are beyond amazing. The guidance of a caring and inclusive leader is evident in this
work.
Work to standardize and improve language around school safety issues, elevated focus on
reporting back to the community about sustainability work as efforts continue to increase in that
arena, compliance in responding to increase public records requests, award for Outstanding
Photography at graduation and increased use of ParentSquare are all noted. As always, Family
Engagement continues to be a place of particular success, with outstanding work to connect with
families in ways that are impactful and meaningful. There is clear evidence of extensive work
with community partners to meet our families’ needs.
This report, combined with our personal observations of the great care paid to individual
community member concerns, suggest comparative excellence in the practice.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
Not new, but requiring a written response to the Promise as part of the job application process is
something the Board appreciates. Impressive/creative job retaining employees though
reassignment and other means during a period of budget challenges. Good effort to rebuild
substitute availability and fill rates post pandemic. Research shows that staff recognition is a key
contributor to staff performance and retention. The sheer number of robust efforts is almost
overwhelming. There is clear evidence of keeping staff up to date on strategies of inclusion and
aligning instructional practices to The Bellingham Promise. There are successful efforts to train
and build skills of paraeducators and beginning educators. There is evidence of maintaining and
improving the numbers of ethnically diverse staff. We understand that these are challenging
times due to state funding formula shortfalls. Continuity in teaching roles supports improved
student outcomes. Ronfeldt-et-al.pdf (caldercenter.org) Our district’s work to maintain continuity
in student-facing roles during a period of significant budget challenge was commendable and
supportive to our students’ development and the goals of The Bellingham Promise.
In addition, the following were noted: work to retain and rehire staff as much as possible during
budget cuts, creativity in how to attract new staff, efficiencies in hiring and onboarding process,
employee recognition is always a high point for this district, volunteers back to pre-pandemic
levels, excellent work around professional learning, particularly around the inclusion model.
The Promise Awards, Good Apple recognition, kickoff event and Promise Stories really celebrate
the great work of individuals and groups within the district. This work is commendable in its

creative reinforcement of The Bellingham Promise goals and outcomes. The positive impact that
new teacher mentoring has on retention is significant. (Hayes 2021) Bellingham’s TOSA
assignment, with funding support from the BEST grant, for mentoring new teachers is a
commendable approach to improving support for new teachers at an especially important time in
their careers.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
None. However, noted are that substitute shortage continues to be a (statewide) challenge, but
work has been done to lessen their need. Continued emphasis on addressing the shortfall in
available substitutes, a problem that is not unique to BPS, is necessary and recognized in the
report.
4. Comments on the report itself.
Comprehensive, plenty of data, examples and links are provided. An excellent report with helpful
information and detail that positions the board well for evaluation of the outcomes relative to our
stated directions and limitations. The Board wonders if it might be a useful addition to include
notable trends in aggregated employee evaluation information in future cycles.
5. Possible changes to the policy.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
Overall, the report is comprehensive with multiple efforts to understand student test performance,
find more and creative ways to measure it, and compare district performance to identified highperforming districts and wider state performances. These efforts give us a good glimpse into how we
have been impacted by pandemic learning loss and how rebound is reflected in standardized testing.
This is one of the most important reports we receive. The board is happy to see that more students are
meeting math standards in grades 3-8 and 10, and we hope to continue to see it improve this
year. ELA scores dropped in a similar fashion to other districts and still remain above state average.
While math scores are a challenge, they do indicate a rebound. Science scores looking strong
compared to state average. Proficiency gaps decreased in a variety of areas. Math growth is looking
strong.
With recognition of the challenging context due to COVID effects, the significant improvement in
meeting math standards relative to other districts (figs 6,8) is commendable. The Board was very
pleased to learn about the great efforts on new curricula adoption and professional learning that may
well have fueled this commendable outcome.
Our strong relative performance in meeting standards for science in grades 5 and 8 (figs 10,12) is also
commendable and an encouraging sign of recovery from COVID impacts. Our understanding is that
we may be seeing positive impacts from the curricula changes made in years past and the potential
impact of our outdoor education work. Commendable progress and outcomes.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
The numbers showing progress are comparatively closely related to previous years, and it is not
clear if the small differences are statistically significant. Some other districts have shown more
progress with learning loss rebound and our hope is to do better going forward. It is understood
that the learning loss is multifaceted and that this is just how it is measured through standardized
testing, which we recognize does not tell the whole story. While the impacts of the pandemic are
improving in many areas, the effects are unsurprisingly still evident across certain stubborn
proficiency and growth gaps.
One interpretation of the testing impacts to grade 10 students is that these anomalous scores may
be the result of COVID era effects due to reduced student familiarity with the standardized tests
and a lack of understanding for the use of these standardized test scores specific to this cycle of
measurement. The Board was glad to learn that we will likely see improvement in this area in
future cycles. Our district stands out for our strong focus on proficiency gaps and the district
team’s efforts to close these gaps. We anticipate continued progress in this area as we see reduced
COVID era effects and with the efforts already underway and would like to voice support for the
importance of these continued efforts.
4. Comments on the report itself.
As usual, these reports get better every year with finding new and creative ways to measure
performance and understand the data. This is an exceptionally rich and transparent report on key
outcomes related to The Bellingham Promise. Thank you for such a well-developed and
documented report.
5. Possible changes to the policy.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
DB:
• There is evidence of modest gap closure with Hispanic/Latinx and low-income groups.
• There have been significant increases in dual credit and CTE participation, particularly among
female students.
• The growth particularly in CTE participation and offerings is impressive.
CDH:
• Despite the difficulties students had during the pandemic, it seems hopeful that dropout rates
seem similar to pre-pandemic.
SR:
• Our overall district graduation rates have improved over the past 10 years beyond state
averages and made important progress towards the rates reflected from the high bar peer
district. This progress is commendable.
• Bellingham’s very strong graduation rates for students with disabilities at 7 years reflects the
values of The Bellingham Promise and illustrates our district’s impressive commitment to
transitioning students effectively to life after public schools. The 90% graduation rate is
especially commendable.
• Our progress in closing the gap for low income vs. non low income students 5 year graduation
rates are evident from the data provided; the progress is commendable.
• The notable increase in CTE dual credit is an impressive reflection of the districts investment
in and dedication to the CTE programs and is commendable outcome. The breadth of

programs offered is impressive and will directly help support engaging student interest and
belonging with applied knowledge and learning opportunities.
The graduation gap between Hispanic/Latinx and non-Hispanic/Latinx Bellingham students
decreased to 6 percent from 8 percent in year-over-year comparison.
Glad to see pandemic doesn’t appear to have had a big impact on dropout rates.
Encouraging to see the gap narrowing between Hispanic/Latines students and low-income
students – especially the latter given poverty’s overall impact on students and families.
Especially heartening to see lasting trends in improved graduation rates over time among
groups.
CTE growth is commendable given how impactful courses can be and how well offerings are
set up to meet diverse student interests and talents.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
DB:
• The graduation gap with multilingual learners increased, though it is recognized these
numbers fluctuate significantly.
• The report indicates that income is perhaps the most significant contributor to graduation rate
gaps.
CDH:
• None.
SR:
• My interpretation of the testing impacts to grade 10 students is that these anomalous scores
may be the result of COVID era effects due to reduced student familiarity with the
standardized tests and a lack of understanding for the use of these standardized test scores
specific to this cycle of measurement. I was glad to learn that we will likely see improvement
in this area in future cycles.
• Our district stands out for our strong focus on proficiency gaps and the district team’s efforts
to close these gaps. I would anticipate continued progress in this area as we see reduced
COVID era effects and with the efforts already underway and would like to voice support for
the importance of these continued efforts.
KR:
• Despite encouraging improvement for low-income and Hispanic/Latines students,
discouraging to see the increased gap and rates that remain below state averages for multilanguage learners and students with disabilities.
