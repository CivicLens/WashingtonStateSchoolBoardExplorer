Explanation of Issue:
Attached are two lists of surplus items. Mike Anderson, Buildings and Grounds Manager, has identified the ceramic and vinyl
tiles as no longer being of use within the district. These tiles were extra stock ordered by the contractor on the Bellingham and
Squalicum High School projects. Also included on this list is the ceramic tile mural affixed to a 6 concrete wall section that was
part of the old Shuksan Middle School. Once these items are declared surplus, they will be held for 30 days and then sold via
the Public Surplus website.
Jim Facciano, Curriculum Director, has reviewed the list of textbooks and kits and agrees that they are no longer needed. Once
the books have been declared surplus, they will be available for students to purchase pursuant to RCW 28A.335.180, after which
time the district will sell the materials to the highest bidder.

Explanation of Issue: Service Plan for Juveniles in Adult Facilities
Attached is a Service Plan for Juveniles in Adult Facilities between the Bellingham School District and the Whatcom County
Sheriff/City Adult Jail for the 2012-13 school year. It is a requirement under state and federal law to have a service plan for
juvenile students under the age of 18 who are assigned to adult jails.
Thank you for your consideration of this agreement.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TO: Tom Venable, Deputy Superintendent
FROM: Kenn Robinson, Program Administrator
DATE: May 15, 2012
SUBJECT: Service Plan for Juveniles in Adult Facilities
Attached are two copies of a service plan that have been developed between our school district and the Whatcom County
Sheriffs Office.
The Bellingham School District is required under state and federal law to have a service plan for juvenile students, under the age
of 18, who are assigned to adult jails. This plan includes such things as:
1. Notification from the county jail to the school district that a juvenile has been received by them for detention.
2. The name, age, and grade of the student and the last known school of regular attendance.
3. The school district is required to offer an educational experience for the juvenile student. This can take several various
forms depending on the length of incarceration of the student, the students high school completion status, and the length
of incarceration.
In this agreement, the district will hire a teacher to coordinate class work and credits through the Alternative Learning
requirements of the state. While there will be some direct instruction, the teacher will serve to orchestrate and review the work
undertaken by the student. An individual Student Learning Plan will be developed with the student that specifies the students
goals and learning activities along with an evaluation process for the students work.
In the 2009 2010 school year we had no juveniles assigned to the adult facility. In the 2010 2011 school year, we had one
student assigned to the adult facility for three weeks before he was moved to juvenile detention. This year we have had no
juveniles assigned to the adult facility.
Funding for this requirement is provided by one of our Title 1 Neglected and Delinquent grants.
I am happy to respond to any questions you may have. I forward this agreement to you for approval.
