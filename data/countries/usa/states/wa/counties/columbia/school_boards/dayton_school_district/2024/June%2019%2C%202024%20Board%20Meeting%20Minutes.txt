Secondary principal Joyce submitted her report electronically. Principal Joyce reported on school climate, communications, academic
excellence and class, classroom and club celebrations. Ms. Joyce reported attendance was a focus this year. Secondary staff decided
on a goal of 35% improvement of 90% attendance comparing semester 1 to semester 2. The high school did meet the goal by the end
of the year with 45.4% of the students attaining 90% or better all year. There were some initial problems with the data that included
students being marked absent for school sponsored events such as sports and club activities. Most of the data was corrected however
there still may be some areas needing corrected. On the last full day of school, most of our 8-11 grade students participated in an
outdoor hike event. Students reported they loved the time to connect with other students and 8th grade students enjoyed their first high
school event. 8th grade students came back to school a little early so they could participate in their 8th grade promotion celebration. 6th
grade outdoor environmental camp at Camp Wooten was amazing for our students. They learned a lot about the outdoors through mini
sessions held during the week. A big highlight was the use of the pool which has been closed for the past two years during our week at
camp.
