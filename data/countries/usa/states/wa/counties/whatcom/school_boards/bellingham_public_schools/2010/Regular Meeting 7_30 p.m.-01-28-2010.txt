Re: Out-of-State Travel for Sara Walker
I am requesting permission for a Shuksan Middle School science teacher to attend The Master Science
Teacher Award conference in San Jose, California, February 7-9, 2010.
The Master Science Teacher Award conference provides an opportunity for participants to derive the
quantitative evaluative tools for identifying effective instruction in the science classroom. Teacher leaders
will have the opportunity to share successful strategies with their colleagues from other states.
Participants will also review a variety of analytical and reflective tools focused on self-evaluation of
instruction. Emphasis will be on reviewing the ability of their teacher designed assessments to truly
inform instruction and measure student progress.
The conference will also focus on helping teacher leaders to develop induction programs to train and
retain effective new teachers. Retaining effective teachers will strengthen our professional learning
communities and ultimately the success of our students.
All expenses for this conference will be paid for by NCOSP and no expenses will be incurred by the
building or school district.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Tanya Rowe, Director of Communications and Community Relations
Explanation of Issue: Report of Progress from 2008-09, Work Priorities for 200911 and
Recommended Next Steps for Strategic Planning
Several times each year, the district's leadership team updates the current District Strategic Plan to
reflect progress and upcoming work priorities. We have attached the most recent District Strategic Plan
update for the Board's review. This information is shared with the public on the district's Web site and
annually through the District's Annual Report, a federal- and state-mandated annual reporting
requirement. The new District Annual Report is attached.

A new process and format for the development of School Strategic Plans was initiated during the 2008-09
school year to better align with and support the expected outcome and goals of the District Strategic
Plan.
Each School Strategic Plan now contains the school's mission, vision, core beliefs, progress, work
priorities, plans to improve learning and measures of progress/evidence of impact. This information is
summarized and shared with all district families and the public through the School Performance Reports,
a communications tool that meets annual federal- and state-mandated annual reporting requirements. A
packet of the completed School Performance Reports was provided to the Board earlier this month.
The 2005-2010 District Strategic Plan was developed through a year-long process in 2004-05. A
Strategic Planning Committee developed the plan based on input from all stakeholder groups within the
Bellingham community. Although significant progress has been made, substantial work remains toward
advancing our goal of preparing all students for college, career and citizenship through powerful teaching
and learning, personalization and engagement. We continue to believe that the goals of our plan are still
viable if we update our Target Objectives and Measures of Progress. One example of an initiative
currently underway to enrich and expand some of the Target Objectives is the work of the districts Title I
Adequate Yearly Progress Improvement Ad Hoc Committee.
Because we are currently in a transition period with a search in progress for a new superintendent, our
Central Administrative Team supports you in recommending that the School Board extend our current
strategic plan for another three to five years. We believe that the plan will continue to guide our work as a
district and provide a solid foundation for our new leader.

FROM: Tanya Rowe, Director of Communications and Community Relations
SUBJECT:Board Report on Launch of New District Web Site
After years of planning and preparations, we plan to launch the new district Web site on Friday, Jan. 29.
The purpose of moving to the new site is improved communications. We recognize that our Web site is
the public face of the district and our most important communications tool.
We are excited that the new site allows for greater flexibility with navigation menus, providing one-click
access to school, departmental and other information that previously required some digging. The new site
will need to evolve over time, but I think we will find that it is a great improvement.
Thank you for the opportunity to share with the Board some of the highlights and new features of the site.
