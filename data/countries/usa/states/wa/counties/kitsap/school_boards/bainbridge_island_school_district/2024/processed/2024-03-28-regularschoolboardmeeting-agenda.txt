Re:Policy 3124 Removal-Release of Student during School Hours - First and Final Reading
______________________________________________________________________________
In December 2011, WSSDA (Washington State School Directors Association) updated Policy 3124: Removal-Release of Student
during School Hours, with minor changes to language and additional cross-references to Policy 3125 - Child Custody and Policy

4200 - Parent access and Safe and Orderly Learning Environment. I have reviewed this policy and updated the language to
reflect changes. Once the second reading is approved, I will update the corresponding Procedure 3124 to align with WSSDA
updates.
I request approval of Policy 3124 Removal-Release of Student During School Hours - First and Final Reading.

Re: Capital Projects, Facilities and Operations Report - March 2024
______________________________________________________________________
Small Works Capital Projects
DA Hogan and Associates are refining multiple design concepts of the Central Campus Athletic Complex for Capital
Committee review during the 2023/2024 school year.
Capital staff are working with the COBI Public Works Department to obtain an updated industrial waste discharge permit
for the connection to the citys sanitary sewer line as a result of the successful sewer lift station replacement.
The Long-Range Strategic Facilities Planning Committee held another successful meeting on March 14th. Meeting topics
included a review of current facility conditions, enrollment, capacity, utilization, and the creation of an educational
adequacy rating system. The Sustainable Action Planning Committee also held another productive meeting on March
20th. Committee members were asked to prioritize goals in an effort vs. value exercise. The group discussed the
reasoning behind each priority and worked on a feasibility timeline.
NW Lift and Equipment is preparing to order the necessary lift components from the manufacturer to start the project.
Performance and payment bonds are being generated by the surety company and should be delivered with a signed
contract in early April.
Permits for the Woodward Middle School Restroom Renovation Project have been submitted to COBI for review. Capital
staff are working with architects and consultants to prepare bid documents and a competitive request for proposals to
local contractors.
In preparation for potential future district-wide projects, Capital staff are working to research and develop district
standards related to solar applications that will allow the district to experience utility savings in the future. Part of this
research will include the compilation and categorization of various grant opportunities available at both the state and
federal levels.
Transportation
Transportation staff are preparing the surplus process for multiple district vehicles that have been replaced over the last
four years.
A new bus is scheduled to be delivered in early April.
WSP Summer inspection is scheduled for May 8th & 9th
Operations
Facilities staff are making plans to perform restorative maintenance during spring break. Custodial staff will apply
additional coats of wax to protect the floors through the rainy spring season, as well as prepare all facilities on the interior
and exterior for end-of-year events such as graduation.
Maintenance staff have successfully removed all lockers within the corridors at Woodward Middle School. Staff are
preparing wall treatments and installing acoustic tackable surfaces per requests from building staff to better display
student work.
Groundskeepers are currently working with CTE staff at BHS to install garden planters for use by the culinary program
and BHS kitchen.

Re: Monthly Report on Technology Levy, Planning and Projects

Technology Levy Budget Summary
This is a summary of the 2023/2024 technology levy budget. This summary provides information on the total encumbrances
(outstanding and paid) applied to the 2023/2024 fiscal school year. The 2023/2024 technology levy budget is supported by
collections from 2021 BISD technology levies.

$ 2,866,770.00
$ 1,346,019.41

Our operational technology status remains healthy. We remain in a relatively quiet period for technology expenditures as we
begin planning summer projects and work through the budget details for the next school year. Since the last Technology Monthly
Report in February 2024, there have been no major technology financial expenditures outside of monthly payroll.
