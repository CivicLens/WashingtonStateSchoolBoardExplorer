Public Content
Maintenance and Operations Equipment Rental staff request authorization to
purchase a new Single-Engine Regenerative Air Sweeper. The proposed

purchase is a scheduled replacement for Stormwater Division's sweeper #17-070.
This replacement wasapproved in the 2023-2028 Capital Improvement Program,
and funds were carried over to 2024 for up to $415,800.
The quoted cost of the new piece of equipment is $433,947, including tax. Savings
realized in procuring four new post-lift jacks earlier this year ($23,080.09) through
the Capital Improvement Program are available to cover the additional expense.
The City entered a cooperative purchasing agreement with Sourcewell in 2018
(Resolution #R-27-18) and obtained the quote throughcontract #093021, which was
awarded to Elgin Sweeper Company. The Sourcewell contract was competitively
bid, and the bidding process conforms to the City's procurement policy.
The proposed vehicle was also evaluated according to Washington State alternative
fuel regulations,and it was determined that an alternative fuel vehicle and fuel
source are not available to meet operational needs.

Recommended Action :

Adopt Ordinance 24-10 as presented to update Pullman
City Code section 1.02 accordingly.

Public Content
Following the issuance of a code violation infraction, Pullman City Code (PCC)
section 1.02.130 allows the person responsible for the code violation to request the
Code Enforcement Officer to re-inspect to determine if correction of the code violation
has been accomplished. Upon confirmation, the Code Enforcement Officer signs and
provides a Certificate of Correction, which may be presented to the Municipal Court
for dismissal of the infraction.
The City of Pullman contracts with the Whitman County District Court to provide
municipal court services. The Whitman County District Court has interpreted PCC
1.02.130 to require re-inspection (if requested) and mandate issuance of certificate(s)
of correction regardless of the number of prior or pending infractions at a single
premises. Allowing serial certificates of correction discourages proactive compliance,
promotes compliance only post-infraction, and contradicts code enforcement
objectives.
The proposed amendment limits the number of available certificates available to a
single person or premises to one (1) per calendar year. This activity balances
compliance with the tolerance of, and opportunity to correct, isolated violations.
Staff recommends the Council adopt this Ordinance as presented.
