Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached resolution in connection with

Public Content
Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer, Director of Capital Projects

Explanation of Issue:
The construction of Elementary School #15 was part of the taxpayer-approved 2022 bond. In today's market, we continue to experience
volatility and supply chain complications. Utilizing the General Contractor/Construction Manager (GC/CM) project delivery model is proven to
be the best model to overcome these challenges while providing the best use of taxpayer funds.

The primary advantages with GC/CM is that the contractor is hired early on as a partner and provides valuable input and recommendations
during design including facility design, siting, phasing, material selection, scheduling, procurement, etc., which is not the case with Design/Bid
/Build. In addition, the GC/CM contractor selection process is based on qualification and fee rather than solely on fee.
Resolution 07-23 will provide assurance of compliance with RCW 39.10.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer, Director of Capital Projects

Explanation of Issue:
As part of the closeout process with the City of Bellingham for the new Sunnyland Elementary School project, improvements to the right-ofway were constructed. Due to existing grades and property boundaries, rainwater runoff from the City right-of-way will enter drainage
facilities on district property. This was contemplated at the time of design by the design team in lieu of constructing a separate public
stormwater facility within the public right of way, and this approach proved to be less costly. The Drainage Release Easement allows for the
City of Bellingham to inspect and maintain these drainage facilities as needed.
