6. Discussion Items/Reports
6.01 Department Updates
Hofstetter Elementary School
●

PBIS-Our referral system works much better using paper and having one person consistently enter the
referrals into the system. Our data is beginning to build and we are able to start seeing trends.

●

Academics: Semester STAR assessments have been completed. The KSI, 1stSI, and 2ndSI are being
completed this week. STAR gives us a broader sense of where kids are and the Skills Inventories give us
exact skill information in their reading and math skills.

●

Professional Learning: LETRS Because of dangerous road conditions, the 2nd in-person LETRS training
has been rescheduled for Feb. 6. The first and second co-horts have been combined for the Feb. 6 training.
“Informed teachers are our best insurance against reading failure. While programs are very helpful tools,
programs don’t teach; teachers do.”

●

MTSS: MTSS is about ensuring that every student has the universal skills, academic and behavioral,
needed to be successful in school. January is about Tier III.

PURPOSE
MTSS Support at Hofstetter Elementary School has three purposes:
1.

To review school-wide behavior and academic data in order to evaluate the effectiveness of core programs

2.

To identify and screen students needing additional academic and/or behavioral support in their least
restrictive environment

3.

To plan, implement and modify interventions for these students depending on each student’s needs and
response to previous intervention(s)

Tier III -- Kids who aren't making progress in Tier 1I will get Tier 3 help. This usually means small group or one on
one lessons daily, using research based methods that are proven to work. Tier III intervention is specifically targeted
to address the foundational and universal skills needed to reach benchmark.

Students were given the STAR 360 reading and math benchmark assessments. This is the 2nd of three major
standardized measures administered to all students and designed to assess students’ progress towards
meeting grade level standards in reading and math. We have focused on reading and the latest assessment
has shown terrific gains in reading.

●

Fort Colville is proud to have 2 National Board Certified teachers on our 4th grade team! Congratulations to
Mrs. Franko and Mrs. Burkey! Through National Board Certification, teachers demonstrate that their
teaching meets the profession’s standards for accomplished practice through a rigorous, peer-reviewed and
performance-based process, similar to professional certification in fields such as medicine.

●

Fort Colville Falcons SOAR! The PBIS Store was January 19th for students to shop with points they’ve
earned. Students and staff will have a PBIS behavior assembly this Friday to celebrate good behavior.

●

Semester One ends January 30th. Parent/Teacher conferences will be held Monday, January 29th and report
cards will be mailed to parents by Friday, February 2nd.

●

5th grade classrooms will be taking a trip to 49 Degrees North on February 20th and 21st to go downhill
skiing or snowboarding. Students will learn about how the mountain is maintained, how the Ski Patrol
works, and they will have a ski or snowboarding lesson from an instructor.

●

ASB had a very successful fundraising event selling Fort Colville Falcon sweatshirts.

Safety Drill
○

This month's safety drill for the district was secure and teach drill. Colville Junior High
administered their drill on January 19th. During this time teachers cover material that teachers and
students need to do during the drill, so students know what is expected of them in case of an
emergency. Administrators walk the campus to make sure the drill is administered correctly and
take notes for any needs or discussions to improve the drill or check in with individual staff
members if needed.

●

Art Pottery
○

Mrs. Anderson was excited to introduce her new unit using clay and her newly acquired kiln from
the high school. Let’s just say that the students at CJHS are loving the unit and are super proud of
the work they are completing in CTE art class. Students are amazed at how the clay and glazes
react after being fired in the kiln. (pictures below)

●

Winter Star Testing
○

Our Math and ELA teachers are administering our end round of STAR assessments. As a building
we will continue to use this data to measure growth from our Tier 1 instruction and for placing
students who may need Tier 2 and 3 interventions. The testing window for the district assessments
ends on January 26th.

to work together.

Our athletic league is going to be changing. Newport and Freeman are dropping to B and Deer Park is moving up to
2A. Blake Sjordal and I have been and will continue to work on this issue. Our major concern is filling out a
complete schedule for our teams without playing a league opponent five times and ensuring we get a shot at state
