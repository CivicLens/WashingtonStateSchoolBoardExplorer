POLICY GOVERNANCE REVIEW

School Principal Jeff Coulter and (via phone conference call) Director of Research and
Assessment Brian Rick. The board viewed a PowerPoint highlighting information in the

within that group, three high performing groups. Mr. Coulter discussed Whatcom Middle
School’s journey and its successes as reflected in the data set. Dr. Copland, Mr. Coulter,
and Mr. Rick then responded to specific questions from the board. Two additional reports
on Ends 2.1 will be presented to the board in February and March.

School Board Directors’ Reports
 Mr. Benjamin
o He will present a report on his recent visit to Sammamish High School at
the Jan. 14th board meeting.
o He expressed appreciation for the tremendous support he has received
from Dr. Gass since he joined the board and he said he is committed to
continue the focus on three items that Dr. Gass is passionate about:
1) Policy Governance; 2) Early childhood education; 3) Special Education.
 Dr. Smith:
o In follow up to the Dec. 9 linkage with health care practitioners, the board
should consider its take-aways from the meeting. For example, should the
board broaden the vision of The Bellingham Promise to include verbiage
that encompasses the entire community’s commitment to Bellingham’s
education? (This will be a discussion item at a future meeting.)
o Should the board consider revisions to The Bellingham Promise at its next
retreat?
o The linkages deserve a more in-depth discussion one or two months
following the actual meeting. (This will be an agenda item at the Feb. 18,
2016 regular meeting.)
