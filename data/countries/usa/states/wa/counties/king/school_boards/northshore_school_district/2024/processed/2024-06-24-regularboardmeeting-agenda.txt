Information

Summary:
The Northshore School District Board of Directors has set aside a period of up to 60 minutes to receive updates and comments
fromDistrictassociation leaders and community members.As referenced in multiple policies adopted by The Board, we expect all parties
addressing the Board to present their comments in a way that is civil and respectful. This means that whether we are school directors,
district staff, students, members of the community, or some other guest, we must all follow the same standard of civility during school board
meetings. Please speak directly to the Board and address matters related to district operations, policies, procedures, and agenda items
under consideration by the Board.
Washington State law requires that the Board limit its business and discussionat the Board meetingto onlythoseitems that have been
captured in the previously published agenda. What that means for us today:
Any public comment regarding itemsthat are includedin the published agenda will be taken into consideration by the Board when the
topic is addressed during the agenda.
Any topics brought up during public comment that are notincludedin the published agenda cannot, by law, be discussed at this
meeting and so will not be addressed or receive a response during the meeting.
In either case, depending on the nature ofyourtopic or questions,a district employee or a board member will follow up onany comments that
relate to district business.Please note that the boards silence during public comment is neutral. It is neither a signal of agreement nor
disagreement with the speakers remarks.
Also please note that comments should not make referenceto any employee or representative of the Districtby name or by identifiable
reference.If you are interested in makingcomments or complaints regardingan individual, you may use thecomplaint process available
through the Office of the Superintendent.
Finally, please remember that your words have impact and you, not the school district, are responsible for your words. We caution all
speakers that it is possible that your statements could violate the rights of others under various laws, including laws protecting privacy and
laws prohibiting defamation. If you are unsure of the legal effect of your remarks, you should seek independent legal advice. In any case, we
ask that you help us model for our students what a respectful and inclusive community looks and sounds like.

District administration recommends board acceptance on
the final agreement as it will enable district technology
resources to meet our growth, maintenance and repair
needs for the next twenty years.

Public Content
Summary:
Since 2003, Northshore School District has had a Franchise Agreement with the City of Woodinville
which provides the District the ability to locate fiber optic cable in public rights-of-way (ROW) in the City.
This pathway through the City provides primary and backup connections for over twenty schools in the
District.
The fiber optic cable connects NSD schools to the District network. The District network supplies internet
access, voice services, and local services such as printing, copiers, intercom, security cameras, access
control, food services, ASB points of sale, and monitoring/management of HVAC, power, lighting, septic
systems, and more.
Per the Franchise Agreement, NSD provides fiber optic connections for the City Fire Department, City
Hall, and Skate Park located across the street from Woodinville HS; all separate from the District
network. This has been a mutually beneficial arrangement for both the District and the City.
This Addendum extends the Agreement up to forty years as well as addresses items that have changed
in the last twenty years. One significant improvement is that this Addendum takes precedence over City
code, which will help protect NSD from decisions the City may make in the next twenty years regarding
utilities running through their Rights of Way.
Attached for your approval is the Addendum to the Franchise Agreement.

The administration recommends that the Board approve
the Constitution and By-Laws and ASB Budget for
Innovation Lab High School's Associated Student Body
(ASB).

Public Content
Summary:
Innovation Lab High School ASB requests the board's approval of a completely new ASB constitution for
our foreseeable future. Our 2023-24 ASB executive board along with myself, the ASB advisor as of
March 2023, have been clarifying the role of the organization of the associated student body at ILHS with
detail, individuality, along with the pursuit of closing major loopholes found over time. The mostly copied
over constitution that we had been previously using from Covid years had articles and descriptions that
were too vague and did not seem to align with our newly acquired WASBO knowledge (Students and
staff attended 2 conferences this year). We ask that you place this constitution under complete review for
its approval.
