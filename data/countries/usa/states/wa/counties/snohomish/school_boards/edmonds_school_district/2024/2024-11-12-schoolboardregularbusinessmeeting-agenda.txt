certification by such auditing officer that the materials have been furnished, the services rendered, and that the claim is
a just, due and unpaid obligation. Warrants shall be approved by a recorded affirmative vote of a majority of the
board."

from 2022 and 2023 relating to Unclaimed Property claims. Property, which include uncashed warrants, are turned over to the state of

Recommended Action :

It is recommended that the board of directors approve
the School Improvement Plans as presented.

Public Content
Information:The 2024-2025 School Improvement Plans are presented to the Board for approval. The
directors received the plans electronically prior to the meeting for review. School Improvement Plans will
be posted to the District website upon approval.
Background:
It is the policy of the Edmonds School District Board of Directors to require each school to develop and
adopt a school improvement plan or process, with annual review for progress and necessary changes.
Each school will submit its plan to district leaders for review. School Improvement Plans will be submitted
to the board each year for initial approval and annual review. Each school improvement plan or process
will be data and inquiry driven and will promote a positive impact on student learning. A positive impact
on student learning means promoting the continuous achievement of the state learning goals and
essential academic learning requirements. The intent is that students can meet the goals of Washingtons
basic education system: to become responsible citizens, to contribute to their own economic well-being
and that of their families and communities, and to enjoy productive and satisfying lives. Each school
improvement plan or process will be based on a building self-review that includes the active participation
and input of building staff, students, families and community members. Each school improvement plan or
process will address the following elements: A. Characteristics of effective schools as identified by the
Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the educational service district (a plan may focus on
one or several of the characteristics for up to three years); B. Safe and supportive learning environments;
C. Educational equity factors including gender, race, ethnicity, culture, language and physical and mental
ability; D. Use of technology; E. Family and community involvement; and F. Other factors identified by the
school community for inclusion in the plan or process. Any school participation in a program of school
improvement assistance through the state accountability system or the federal Elementary and
Secondary Education Act will constitute sufficient compliance with this policy.

Information:
Single Reading, Approve Resolution #24-26 Certification of 2025 Excess Property Taxes
Background:
When the district established the 2024-25 budget, it included an Educational Programs and Operations
Levy for calendar year 2025 in the amount of $65,103,251. This was based on an estimated Consumer
Price Index (CPI) forecast of 3.1% for September 2024. While the CPI for the levy is 3.1%, the districts
final enrollment for 2023-24 was slightly higher than projected last March. This increases the calendar
year 2025 levy by $165,159 to $65,268,410. This is still lower than voter authorization of $70,800,000.
Additionally, the Assessors Office provided information that the district may collect an additional amount
due to refunds. By law, the Board will need to adopt a resolution to certify the updated levy amount.

Public Content
Information:
Mountlake Terrace High School (MTH) HVAC Replacement Project
Background:
The MTH HVAC Replacement project was identified in the 2021 Levy, approved by voters in April of
2021, and the selection of Hermanson Company as the Progressive Design Builder was approved by the
board at its December 12, 2023 regular business meeting. The first portion of the project, GMP 1, and the
initial budget authorization were approved by the board on January 25, 2024. GMP 1 met substantial
completion on August 31, 2024.
If The Board of Directors authorizes award of the contract for this matter, the District would execute the
attached agreement and issue a purchase order in the amount of $8,499,479 for GMP 2 construction
services. (See attached Hermanson Company Proposal.)
Scope of work for GMP 2 includes air side HVAC replacement, associated controls and additional
chillers. Work scope identified in GMP 2 will be completed by the end of summer 2025. The proposal is
consistent with the total project budget.
Absent unforeseen conditions or District requested scope changes, the GMP Amendment sets a ceiling
for the construction cost of phase 2. If the actual Cost of the Work plus fee totals less than the amount
covered by the GMP, the agreement provides that savings be returned to the School District.
The District Capital Projects Office requests an increase in budget authorization of $3,100,000, bringing
the total project budget to $18,000,000 as the total project budget set for this project, which includes all
remaining costs related to the completion of the Mountlake Terrace High School HVAC system and sales
tax.
The additional budget authorization requested will be funded by the 2024 Bond.

Background:
The revisions reflect OSPIs New emergency rules which were recently released. The updates to the policy and procedure are based on
three keychanges that OSPI made through its emergency rules.
First, OSPI replaced the term discipline with two new terms: discretionarydiscipline and nondiscretionary discipline.

Second, OSPI eliminated other forms of discipline as a defined term in the studentdiscipline rules. It also removed the requirement for school
districtsto identify other forms of discipline in their student discipline policies andremoved the requirement to attempt other forms of discipline
beforeadministering classroom exclusions and emergency removals.
Third, OSPI made changes to classroom exclusions. It redefined the termclassroom exclusion, eliminated the requirement that other forms
ofdiscipline be attempted before excluding a student from the classroom,changed how long a student could be excluded, and gave school
districtsdiscretion about how exclusions are reported.

First Reading (no action), Review Revised Board Policy 5005- Employment: Disclosures, Certification
Requirements, Assurances and Approval
Background:
We recommend updates to this policythat include adding new measures for checking the background of
volunteers, adding a statement regarding that pre-employment drug testing will follow the named RCW,
and several organizational and grammatical changes. The substantive changes align with WSSDA's
model policy 5005.
Regarding volunteers, we currently require all volunteers to complete the Washington State Patrol
background check. For any volunteers that may work regularly with students in an unsupervised
environment, we would add fingerprinting that is run through the FBI database. This is a much more
thorough check and, we believe, reduces risk.
While volunteers are expected to be in environments that are fully supervised by district employees, there
are occasions when they may not be the case. Examples could include a volunteer coach who is working
with a group of students outside of the direct line of sight of the coach for extended periods of time. We
will ask supervisors to evaluate what a volunteer will be doing and in which environments. If needed, they
will direct volunteers to go to Human Resources for fingerprinting.
