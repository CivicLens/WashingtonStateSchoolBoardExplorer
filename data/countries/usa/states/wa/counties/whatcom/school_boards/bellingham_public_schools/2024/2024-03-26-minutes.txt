Meeting Purpose – Explanation of Community Linkages: Dr. Baker thanked everyone
for taking the time to be here this evening. This linkage will give the school board

introduced Heather Steele, director of CTE. Heather shared background information
about CTE and showed a video.
Dr. Baker asked the five table groups to converse and respond to the guiding questions
provided:
•
•

What do you see as the primary strengths of our current CTE programs?
In what areas do you think our CTE offerings could be improved or expanded?

•
•
•
•

How do you see CTE reflected in our strategic plan The Bellingham Promise?
Are there any concerns you have regarding the accessibility or quality of CTE
offerings at our schools?
How do you view the role of CTE in preparing students for the local workforce
and economy?
How can schools and the community work together to ensure that CTE offerings
reflect the needs and priorities of local industries?

At the end of the small group time, Dr. Baker asked each group to share briefly what they

How could we have more diverse offerings in our CTE portfolio? Compared to county
school districts, we do not have a lot of agriculture offerings. That could be a growth area
for us.
We think CTE connects to The Bellingham Promise because it helps students identify
passion areas.
Hands on learning is a strength of CTE.
We appreciate the strong tech offerings in Bellingham Public Schools.
Lots of different pathways to accommodate student needs. We really appreciate that.
Would love to build more opportunities and connections in the community, especially in
health care.
Industry leaders are looking for people with soft skills in addition to an academic
background. We want students to be skilled at communication.
The workforce will have a lot of retirements in the coming years, and we need to help
students find the right opportunities to fill these slots.
A strength in our district is that we have strong vertical planning. There is a nice
progression from middle to high school. We’d love to take that further.
CTE builds strong connections with real world applications.
We have students who enjoy working with the local film community.
Areas of improvement: how to connect with seven other school districts in Whatcom
County to work together? Could there be a more efficient use of resources?
Strong connections to The Bellingham Promise and transferrable skills between CTE and
academic areas. Many CTE teachers use a different approach to teaching, but all learning
is connected. Facilitated learning in CTE is tied to The Bellingham Promise in many
ways, including leadership skills, collaboration, problem-solving, etc.
We would love to see more CTE opportunities for middle school students.
There are many strong indicators of positive feedback from industry leaders.
Could there be opportunities for grant writing? Maybe hit up local industries/companies?
There are foundations and professional organizations that may be interested in helping
the district and our schools with funds if it means helping them meet workforce needs.

Dr. Baker thanked the attendees for participating in this evening’s community linkage.
Mr. Benjamin thanked everyone for their valuable input, which will help affect decisions
that are made in the future. The school board members are not educators, but represent

2

the community, and it’s important that the board hears what our community needs and
expects of our district. He adjourned the meeting at 7:00 p.m.
