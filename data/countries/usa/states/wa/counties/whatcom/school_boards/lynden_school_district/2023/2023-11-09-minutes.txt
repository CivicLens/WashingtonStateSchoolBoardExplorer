7. Action Items
Approval of Pro/Con Committee Members
The board is legally required to approve the appointment of “For” and “Against” committee
members after the district performs “diligent effort” in soliciting community members to serve
on both of those committees. These committees will be responsible for preparing “For” and
“Against” statements for the Voters Pamphlet in February for the funding initiatives.
After fulfilling those legal obligations, Superintendent VanderYacht is recommending that Caleb
Hazel, Karen Timmer, and Kent Oostra be approved as “For” committee members for the bond
and levy funding initiatives and that Trevor Holman be approved as the “Against” committee for
both the bond and levy ballot measures initiatives.
Cindy Petersen motioned to approve Caleb Hazel, Karen Timmer, and Kent Oostra as “For”
committee members. Seconded by David Vis. Motion carried by voice vote.
Board Vote: 3-1. Advisory Vote: 1-0. Director Hickman opposed.
Cindy Petersen motioned to approve Trevor Holman as the “Against” committee member for the
bond and levy. Seconded by Tonya Hickman. Motion carried by voice vote.
Board Vote: 4-0. Advisory Vote: 1-0.
After discussion, Cindy Petersen moved to amend the motion made to approve Trevor Holman as
“Against” committee for both the bond and levy and approve his appointment to only the
“Against” committee for the bond. David Vis seconded. Motion carried by voice vote.
Board Vote: 3-1; Advisory Vote- 1-0. Director Costanti opposed.
8. Board Workshop
9. Information from Board Members
Discussion was held regarding elevating student voice in governance through our student board
representatives, which included vision and actionable next steps. Director Costanti has reached
out to both student representatives expressing his desire to provide opportunities for a more
meaningful experience. We would like to identify areas of interest in which we can connect
student representatives with the student body and then then have them come back to the board
during a public meeting with recommendations.
Discussion was held regarding the addition of a board meeting agenda item for “Information
from the Student Board Representatives”. Another thought is to have a yearly calendar noting
when student representatives would address the board about certain issues- possibly a ‘State of
the School’.

Student Director Cooper Graddon expressed his interest in beginning the student advisory group
again this year. Director Petersen expressed her interest in student reps being able to connect
with and advocate for not just high school students, but students across the district. She asked if
there was a possibility of adding student advisory groups at each school.
The focus moving forward will be on establishing the structure and schedule. Superintendent
VanderYacht will work with student directors Kyle Tucker and Cooper Graddon to establish a
structure for the superintendent student advisory to get started and work on topics.
Superintendent VanderYacht ended the meeting by presenting CJ Costanti, David Vis, and Cindy
Petersen with a plaque of appreciation for their service to Lynden Schools and said a few words
to each of them in appreciation for their service.
10. Adjourn Meeting to go into Closed Session
CJ Costanti motioned to adjourn the meeting at 8:30 pm.
