ABSENCE OF A BOARD MEMBER

Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice, as soon as possible, to the president or
superintendent of their inability to attend a board meeting. Board directors will participate in a roll call to
reflect attendance during the meeting for the record. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive absences from
regular board meetings without receiving respectful communication from the absent board member.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

AGENDA ITEM:
47 Microsoft Surface Laptop 6s will be purchased to run a teacher and support staff device pilot program
that will cover each elementary school, middle school, and academy with two devices at the four high
schools. This pilot is intended to confirm that the Surface Laptop performs as expected in the classroom
and is an adequate device for support staff and teachers. Once the pilot is completed, the devices will be
repurposed as backup units for teachers following the refresh.

the current device form factor. The current devices would then be redeployed to secondary students to
help address device attrition.

Schools Out WashingtonRefugee School Impact Grant Acceptance
AGENDA ITEM:
TheSchools Out WashingtonRefugee School Impact Program (RSIP) has again this year, awarded a
grant to Kent School District, to provide extended-day learning programs and during the school day
support to qualifying students during the 2024-2025 school year. This years grant award is $1,016,000 to
serve 350 students in the Kent School District. Our state has received less Refugee School Impact
funding; for this reason, the State is allocating some Ukrainian Refugee School Impact funds.
Due to this blended funding model, Kent School District will be funded as follows:
$335,000 from Ukrainian Refugee School Impact funds to serve 115 qualifying Ukrainian students
and
$681,000 from Refugee School Impact funds to serve 235 qualifying refugee students
This grant allocates funds to community-based organizations for supplemental programs to serve
qualifying students who have refugee status and have been in the United States for five years or less.

This years grant award is $122,000 lower than the award in 2023-2024 and will allow us to serve 350
students in 21 schools through both virtual and in-person programs. We will be working with two
community-based organizations this year to serve students through this grant. The organizations include
Communities of Rooted Brilliance and the International Rescue Committee. Communities of Rooted
Brilliance will provide programming at the elementary school level. International Rescue Committee will
work with elementary and secondary school students. Parent and family engagement opportunities and
professional development for KSD (KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT) staff will also be provided through the
RSIP funding by these community-based organizations.

BOARD GOALS:
Goal 1: Preparing Global Citizens
Goal 2: Expanding Student, Family and Community Partnerships.
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
The grant award for 2024-2025 fromSchools Out WashingtonRefugee School Impact Program is
$1,016,000. Last year the grant was $1,138,000; this is a decrease of 122,000 from the 2023-2024 grant
award.

2024-2025 School Improvement Plans
AGENDA ITEM:
As required by Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), school improvement plans are locally developed at
each school with stakeholders (principals, other school leaders, teachers, students, and parents
/guardians). Following the Plan, Do, Study, Act framework these comprehensive plans outline a process
for improved student outcomes by identifying high leverage strategies to be implemented by school
personnel. Board Policy 2005 requires that each school submit its plan to the board of directors by
November 1 of each year for review and acceptance.
Each school year, School Improvement Plans (SIPs) are uploaded to the Kent School District (KSD)
website. We invite all stakeholders, in each community, to review their School Improvement Plan and
direct any questions to the school principal.
BOARD GOALS:

Goal 1: Preparing Students to be Global Citizens
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
BUDGET IMPLICATION:

RECOMMENDATION:
That the board of directors approve this item.

Scenic Hill Elementary Emergency Repair and Reroute Heating Loop Above Ground
AGENDA ITEM:
Contract to DuoTEC, Inc. to repair the heating loop, which is below the slab, in the main building at
Scenic Hill Elementary School. To stop water loss the loop had to be secured which turned off the heat
to the main building. With no heat in teaching spaces, an emergency response was needed to
reestablish heat before outside temperatures begin to drop. Space heaters have been distributed until
repairs can be made. Considering the age of the pipe, the requirement to cut and excavate the
concrete slab, and the difficulty pinpointing the leak, the best, most cost-effective, least disruptive, and
most expedient solution is to abandon the underground portion of the loop and reroute the pipes
overhead in the interior of the building.
Per Policy 6210 Purchasing Authorization and Control

Board approval for the purchase of capital outlay items is required when the aggregate total of a requisition exceeds $25,000
except that the superintendent will have the authority to make capital outlay purchases without advance approval when it is
necessary to protect the interests of the district or the health and safety of the staff or students.

BOARD GOALS:
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
$97,838.87, including tax, this is an emergency response which was not forecasted for the 2024-2025
school year. It will be paid from the Facilities Maintenance 2025 budget.

N/A - Informational only.
