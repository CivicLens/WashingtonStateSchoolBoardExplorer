Information

Public Content
The board values public input and is responsible for actively listening to and reflecting on public
comments. The board may only discuss and act upon items included in the written agenda. For that
reason, board members cannot respond to any comments or questions during public comment but can
ask the Superintendent to follow up on issues raised during public testimony.
Guidelines for public input emphasize the respect and consideration of others. Boisterous conduct will not
be permitted at any meeting of the Board of Directors, nor will any harassing or threatening remarks be
tolerated. Complaints about individual employees should be directed to the superintendent's office as a
personnel matter. The board requests that anyone who has submitted written public comments refrain
from reading them during this portion of our meeting to allow other community members to share their
comments.
Per Board policy 1420P, Public Comments are limited to three minutes for each speaker and no more
than a total of 15 minutes (5 speakers) on an item included on the agenda.
