parents of students at Carl Cozier Elementary School. Each addressed the board.
They described their children’s experiences at Carl Cozier and expressed the
desire to transfer their children to another school in the coming year. They urged
the board to allow transfers to be granted to parents who request them.

Superintendent’s Announcements and Report : Dr. Baker reported on the following
items:
 Budget: After summarizing recent activities in the budget process, Dr. Baker said
a draft budget will be presented to the board at its regular meeting on June 12.
The final budget will be presented to the board for formal adoption on June 26.
 Repurposing Larrabee Think Tank: The group has completed its work and has
forwarded sent Dr. Baker its recommendations for use of the facility. An
announcement regarding next steps will be made this week.
 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA): The U.S. Department of
Education has mandated that Washington State resume implementation of ESEA,
which means school districts throughout the state will have less flexibility in
spending $41 million in federal Title I funds. Dr. Baker has met with officials at
the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) on this matter. Because
the district anticipated this decision, its impact has been factored into budget
planning. More information is expected from state and federal legislators, so the
final budgetary impact is not yet fully determined.

Following is a summary of comments:
o Mentoring: Student connections with an adult or an older student through various
mentoring programs have proven very effective. Mentoring programs involving
students from Western Washington University have been particularly beneficial.
o Intervention Programs: A variety are used, including AVID (Advancement Via
Individual Determination); Read 180, Collection of Evidence, credit retrieval
classes, and after school tutorial centers.
o Squalicum: Data shows that failure numbers are going down and pass rates are
going up.
o Squalicum: Storm Riders, a program focusing on study skills and self advocacy, is
in its second year, with 25 students currently participating.
o Bellingham: The support team meets every Monday to share ideas and to discuss
students who are struggling. This has been a good resource. Intervention classes
are offered throughout the day. The tutoring center is becoming part of the culture
of the school. Many kids view it as a good, positive, safe place that represents a
normal part of their school day.
o College-Bound Scholarship Program: Steve Clarke noted that the district’s
participation level is one of the highest in the state.
o Communities in Schools of Whatcom County: This organization is a community
partner that focuses on dropout prevention.
o Options: A “wrap-around” school that will bring any service that will help
students into the school. Use of online or computer-based programs, for example,
is growing and helps to provide students a different pathway for credit retrieval.

o There is sufficient evidence within the Superintendent’s report and other
information provided to determine that the district IS in compliance with the
ends policy.
o The District has achieved the goals established in the policy.
Motion included inclusion of the following comments on the Ends-1 summary
sheet:
o Every facet of Walking in the Shoes project is on point. Comments from the
community have been wonderful. Good job!
o The Administration has made the Bellingham Promise come alive, by
presenting it district-wide in a consistent format and by tying it into the work
of the district at all levels.

action? That is, provide examples of how the District supports its staff to
empower students to discover & develop a passion and to contribute to their
community.
o Ends-1 speaks to every child and a collective community commitment. Two
big take-aways from the mission and vision are (1) Every Child has
Individualized Instruction and Support to meet his / her needs, and (2) the
District is increasingly working with community partners to support our
children. Neither of these are addressed in the report.
o The policy should be revised to clear up differences in interpretation.
