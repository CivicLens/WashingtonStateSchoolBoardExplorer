  Chairman Hillaire discussed the difference between a land acknowledgment and a Welcome.  The land acknowledgement is a commitment to the land and a promise through the Treaty of Elliott.  Lawrence Solomon shared a song and a story of the great flood.
  Ms. Leighton described the timeline of how the FSD Land Acknowledgement was developed.  Lummi Nation adopted it by resolution which puts it into Lummi Law.  It is a statement that is shared with the public to use.   Ms. Leighton mentioned that one piece of the original plan was to raise a Nation flag which has not happened yet.  Jay Julius shared history.  Ms. Uppiano raised the question of protocol of who can read the statement. Ms. Leighton responded that non-indigenous people read the acknowledge because indigenous people don't need to acknowledge the land they are from, but they would use a welcome for non-indigenous people to the land. Dr. Tom spoke to her educational journey and the challenges along the way.  Mr. Locker spoke to being raised in Ferndale, how he became a history major and why building a relationship with the Nation is important.  Ms. Lincoln and Ms. Nylen spoke to the requirement to have indigenous studies in our schools and their classroom experience. 
Mr. Ledbetter spoke to providing "space" for native students so that they have a sense of belonging. 
  Dr. Dominguez closed by thanking the guests and was touched by the stories.  Ms. Cool inquired as to what the community could do to learn more.  Chairman Hillaire welcomed anyone to visit and formally invited the Board to attend The First Salmon ceremony on May 18, 2023.
