  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Monthly Reports
Written reports from each school administrator were attached to the meeting agenda for board review. There was no additional discussion.
  B. Budget Status and Financial Report
Director of Finance Keith Yaich provided an update from the district's business office, adding comments on the learning he has done since starting in July.

Director Galbraith asked to have a monthly report on the meeting agenda showing the board and superintendent budget status. Director Creydt and President Freeman expressed support for that suggestion.
  C. Superintendent's Report
School Schedule & PLCs: Teachers returned on August 23. The first day of school for students is August 28, which is the first weekly 1-hour late start. PLC meetings will take place during that hour.
Supper with the Superintendent: This year’s first Supper took place on August 19. Topics included bullying and student discipline, which are significant concerns among parents. The Parent-Superintendent Advisory Committee has suggested a K-5 literacy curriculum topic for the next Supper in September.
Vape Detectors: Installation of vape detectors is on track for the first day of school. These detectors alert principals to vaping, as well as to sounds resembling fights. However, the detectors do not record audio.
Student Discipline: New student discipline updates have been released, but WSSDA's model policy won't be available until next week. This policy update will be on the September meeting agenda for first reading.
Staffing: A leave replacement position is being added to support district needs. Potential staffing for kindergarten and 3rd grade may be required if enrollment exceeds classroom limits.
Birch Bay Property: The county council approved an additional wetlands study at the Gemini property, and the district is evaluating other properties in case an alternative is needed.
Video Streaming Equipment: Video equipment arrived today but hasn't been mounted yet. Streaming of meetings is anticipated to start in October. The September meeting at Pt. Roberts Primary School will not be streamed due to the internet connection at that location.
Capital Projects: The middle school cafeteria flooring project is complete and will not be impacted by future construction plans.

Director Lazarus inquired about the “Vote Yes” committee. Dr. Granger explained that there was no opposing statement submitted to the Local Voters Pamphlet, but a “Yes” statement was submitted. Dr. Granger added comments on additional efforts being made to ensure accurate information is communicated to the public, emphasizing that the proposed bond will replace the current capital levy and other expiring bonds.

President Freeman mentioned that some Birch Bay residents are questioning how the proposed bond would benefit their community. Director Lazarus affirmed that funding is already available to purchase property in Birch Bay. Director Creydt commented on the importance of fulfilling that commitment to purchase property as approved by voters many years ago. Dr. Granger explained the status of the wetlands study, and Director Creydt requested copies of the wetlands study reports. President Freeman indicated he would like to see progress on that property purchase in line with the upcoming November election.
  5. Consent Agenda
Before the Consent Agenda vote, Director Swinburnson again raised concerns about contracts being signed before board approval. Discussion centered on the example of a recent contract that was signed and enacted without prior approval. President Freeman suggested reviewing contracts outside of meetings, but Dr. Granger cautioned against the board taking action outside of an open public meeting. Director Swinburnson questioned what would happen if the board didn’t approve a contract that had already been signed, and Director Lazarus proposed addressing this in policy. Director Creydt noted that Dr. Granger had previously asked for board direction, and suggestions were discussed. Director Swinburnson clarified there were no integrity concerns with the current contracts, but the procedure was an issue, and Director Creydt indicated that she views this as a boundary issue.

The board voted unanimously to approve all items on the Consent Agenda, except for the NWESD UDL contract that was previously removed at Director Galbraith's request.

He’s spent the past two months researching and stressed the critical importance of reading instruction at the K-3 level. He urged the board to provide teachers with the best tools, noting his belief that Fountas & Pinnell should be eliminated, as it contributes to poor literacy outcomes.

Director Swinburnson echoed Dr. Granger’s appreciation for the administrators and referenced suggestions made during budget discussions questioning the need for principals. The work session presentations showcased the exceptional work they do, inspiring him to continue serving on the board. This demonstrates the importance of streaming meetings for better community access.

  C. Resolution 2324-13 WIAA Fair, Safe, and Nondiscriminatory Practice in
      Athletic and Extracurricular Activities
President Freeman indicated the resolution was not what he had in mind when he recommended this in August. His desire was not to direct WIAA but to make a strong statement, specifying sex defined at birth. He suggested postponing it for revision. Discussion continued regarding the source of the resolution's wording, with comparison to resolutions adopted in Lynden, Kennewick, and Colville. Dr. Granger explained the resolution's wording was taken from Lynden's version, with minor changes to allow for collaboration with other districts. He has not seen the resolution from Colville yet.

Director Swinburnson agreed on the desire for stronger language and suggested that the district's attorney provide an opinion on the wording, prioritizing compliance with state law over OSPI guidelines. Director Lazarus asked President Freeman to share the other districts' resolutions by email.

This matter was postponed by consensus.
  D. Resolution 2324-14 Adoption of 2024-2025 Budget

  G. Policy 5251 Conflicts of Interest: First Reading
Director Swinburnson reaffirmed his belief that the district has excellent teachers and expressed support for allowing them to tutor, with restrictions. He proposed that teachers should be allowed to tutor students who are not in their class and be paid for summer tutoring, though not for tutoring their own students. He saw this as a way to benefit students and referenced language provided by Director Galbraith which could accomplish this objective.

Director Galbraith agreed and read aloud his proposed language, moving for first reading of his suggested language. Director Creydt seconded.

Director Lazarus expressed opposition to teachers tutoring their own students, believing it would create bias. He shared concerns about impartiality, while Director Galbraith countered that teachers are professionals and proposed requiring parental permission to address any concerns. He doesn't believe there is a risk of malfeasance.

President Freeman asked how conflicts of interest would be addressed, referencing a past issue when a teacher’s tutoring practice was suspended. Discussion continued, and Dr. Granger also warned against discussing investigations in public meetings. Dr. Granger asked for an opportunity to review Director Galbraith’s language, reminding the board of the difficulty of receiving recommendations during a meeting rather than in advance. President Freeman asked if Director Galbraith wished to withdraw his motion in order to allow for review of his suggested language. Further discussion continued. Director Galbraith disagrees with addressing conflicts in extra-curricular activities in the same language as academic tutoring. After additional discussion, Director Galbraith withdrew his motion.

A. Discussion and General Comments
K-5 Literacy Curriculum: Director Galbraith addressed K-5 literacy earlier in the meeting.
Enrollment Committee: Director Swinburnson suggested forming an advisory committee to address declining enrollment and proposed regular discussions on boosting student numbers. Dr. Granger provided context on how the district reviews enrollment data, noting that last year's review led to the creation of the district's new online learning program. He emphasized the importance of protecting family privacy when contacting those who have withdrawn. He also mentioned upcoming discussions with the city council about affordable housing in Blaine. Dr. Granger referenced the last committee created by the board which was the Facility Rental Fees Review Committee in fall of 2019. That committee included two board members, the superintendent, and multiple stakeholders.

Director Swinburnson responded to concerns expressed by Ms. Gattis during public comment and in her multiple emails, indicating those issues had been discussed in prior meetings. He praised the board and superintendent for their communication regarding budget challenges during and after the COVID pandemic, and acknowledged that budget reduction decisions were difficult but necessary and were well-considered. He further encouraged review of the records from prior meetings where those discussions took place. Director Lazarus agreed that decisions had been well thought out. Director Creydt added comments on the importance of considering feedback like that received from Ms. Gattis, as well as listening to parents who have withdrawn their students. She referenced her conversation with the board president from Everson School District, emphasizing that enrollment numbers are essential to maintaining a stable budget.
