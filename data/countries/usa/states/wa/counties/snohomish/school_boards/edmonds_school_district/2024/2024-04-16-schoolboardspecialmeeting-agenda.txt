Information:
First Reading (no action), Resolution #24-09, 2024-2025 Reduced Educational Program
Background:
Due to a variety of factors the district is facing a budget shortfall for 2024-25. In order to reduce the district's expenditures to the level of
anticipated revenues, it is necessary for the district to make reductions in the educational program, including reductions of both certificated
and classified positions. Attached is the recommended reduced educational program reflecting identified reductions. This is a first reading of
the Reduced Educational Program. A second reading and recommendation for approval will be brought to the board on April 23rd. It is
necessary to have board approval of the Reduced Educational Program resolution in order to notify affected certificated employees by May
15, 2024 as required by law. These numbers may change as we process additional resignation and retirement requests. After the reduction,
recall will be processed according to the applicable bargaining agreement.

Final decisions regarding the entire 2024-25 budget will be completed in time for the budget public
hearing in July. We are still processing the feedback we received from the Balancing Act survey as well
as the feedback submitted via the Google form on our district website. We are very grateful to those who
completed the survey and provided comments and feedback.
