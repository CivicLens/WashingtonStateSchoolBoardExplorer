MEMORANDUM

TO: School Board of Directors
FROM: Dr. Greg Baker, Superintendent
DATE: May 26, 2016
RE: WSSDA 1000 Policy Series and Policy Governance Alignment Recommendations
Following research regarding best practices from other school districts and counsel from Monte Bridges last year, I recommend we use the
following policy model to align the 1000 policy series with policy governance. It retains the WSSDA numbering system for ease of use by the
public, and as recommended by Dr. Bridges. This model is used by Federal Way Public Schools.

The board currently has 12 governance policies; we have taken the first policy in the 1000 series to create GP-13. This memo contains the
first of four sets of 1000 series policies. If the board likes this mode, we can draft the remaining policies for your review.

Following discussion by the board, I ask the board to take action to adopt this new set of 1000-series policies to replace our existing 1000series policies. I also request that the board review, edit as desired, and adopt these new GPs.
