Explanation of Issue:
In March 2016 the school board approved Dawson Construction Inc. as the General Contractor
Construction Manager (GCCM) for the new Sehome High School.
Since that time, Dawson has been involved in a variety of pre-construction activities including design
consultation, value engineering, constructability analysis, bid planning, schedule development, etc.
Dawson is now ready to begin the initial construction phase of the project.This work will include a portion
of Negotiated Support Services that need to commence at this time, including preparation of the

construction staging area, erosion control measures including an initial detention pond, and a portion of
Specified General Conditions to manage and supervise the work (see Attachment A to the Amendment).
In order for these activities to commence, the district must execute an amendment to theGuaranteed
Maximum Price (GMP) for the project.
The amendment specifies the scope of the work and a not-to-exceed price for performing the work.The
final amount paid for the work will be subject to itemized invoices for both time and materials. As Dawson
continues with additional construction work, we will bring additional GMP amendments to you for your
consideration.The cost process will culminate late this spring or early summer with the establishment of
the final Guaranteed Maximum Price for the project.
Board approval of the attached Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment for the Sehome High School
project is requested.
