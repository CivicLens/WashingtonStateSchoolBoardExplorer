Discussion
  Resolution 813: 2024-25 Reduction in Force
Dr. McSheehy explained that because of shortfalls in funding from the state, the District has to plan for a potential reduction in force (RIF) for the following school year, noting it is natural to reduce program if the enrollment is also reducing. Resolution just authorizes Superintendent to plan for RIF. Noted that last school year’s RIF resolution allowed for 8.0 FTE certified, but, through high-value retirements, attrition, and increased class sizes, only 0.2 FTE was ultimately reduced.
