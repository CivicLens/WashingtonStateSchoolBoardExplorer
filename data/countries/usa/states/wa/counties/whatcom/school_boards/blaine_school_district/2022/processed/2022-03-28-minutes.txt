  2. Work Session Content
A. Use of School Facilities
Dr. Granger provided background regarding the district's challenges with meeting the needs of community groups who use district-owned facilities. He described the meeting with community groups that took place in January, and he explained there were no requests to adjust the existing fee schedule. Therefore, Dr. Granger is not recommending any changes to the fee schedule or to Policy 4260.

President Thomas shared positive comments on the fee schedule. He believes the structure adopted in 2019 is more fair and actually costs less for community groups.
  B. Policy Discussion: 4000 Series
Updates to the 4000 series of the district’s policy manual were provided by WSSDA pursuant to the district’s contract for Policy Manual Review Services. The 4000 series of the policy manual regulates Community Relations. No discussion questions were submitted in advance.

Director Creydt asked what was happening currently with the SRO, and discussion followed. Dr. Granger explained that, by mutual agreement with the City of Blaine, the SRO position was not brought back due to reductions at both entities. Additionally, Dr. Granger explained the recent nationwide trend to reduce police presence in schools, and he explained the concerns addressed by WSSDA's new model Procedure 4311P School Safety and Security Services Program. Director Creydt expressed disappointment that the SRO program had ended, and she asked for information to be emailed to her regarding the above-referenced nationwide trend. Discussion continued related to campus security and law enforcement's function on campus, and Dr. Granger assured the board that the district continues to experience rapid response times and a supportive relationship with local law enforcement agencies.

Director Gibson shared positive comments regarding updates to Policy 4040 Public Access to District Records and discussion followed regarding recent trends in Public Records Act requests.

Dr. Granger reiterated that no changes would be made to Policy 4260 Use of School Facilities. There was discussion regarding the scheduling of facility use. Dr. Granger explained the quarterly scheduling meetings for local organizations to come together and work out a mutually agreeable schedule for use of facilities. Dr. Granger commented on the value of holding these round-table discussions with community stakeholders. Director Creydt said she believes the costs are still prohibitive, and discussion continued. Dr. Granger indicated that he has not received any complaints about prohibitive cost, and he encouraged any community groups who find the fees to be prohibitive to share their concerns with him so that they can be addressed. Community athletics and fine arts groups are the most frequent users of campus facilities.
