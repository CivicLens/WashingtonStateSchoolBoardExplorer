Meeting Purpose – Explanation of Student Roundtable: Dr. Baker thanked everyone
for taking the time to be here this afternoon. Student roundtables give the school board an
opportunity to strengthen the connection with our students, and the school board is
excited to hear what students have to say about their experiences.
Small Group Discussion with School Board Members and Facilitators: For
discussion purposes, student attendees, board members and executive team members
were divided into five groups, and the small groups focused on guiding questions. After
discussion at individual tables, the following responses and comments were shared.
What do you like about your new building?
• It’s bigger, with two floors and an elevator.
• The water fountains and water bottle fillers.
• The larger cafeteria and gym.
• There is a music room instead of a portable.
• Air conditioning.
• More playground options, including a tire swing and more basketball hoops.

More separation from the younger students.
There are monitors all over the school.
We really like our teachers.
The new school is much nicer.

What is exciting or different about your new school compared with the old
Sunnyland? Do you have anything that you miss about the old school?
• We miss the big yellow slide from the old playground.
• We miss the vibe of the old school.
• We liked having access to the old field and playing capture the flag.
• We were closer together in the old building and saw more people there.
• We miss the big lion picture inside the old school.
• The library is smaller but is cozy.
We have gone through big changes with COVID in the past few years:
o What do you remember about school in 1st and 2nd grade?
o Was anything hard? Was there anything you liked?
o What do you think about school now – in 4th grade? How does it feel?
• During the pandemic, we spent a lot of time on Zoom.
• There were more breaks during the day and the learning portions of the day were
shorter.
• We didn’t like the “raising hand” emoji.
• We had to line up so many times every day to wash our hands.
• We had to wear masks.
• We did a lot of baking at home.
• There’s a lot we don’t remember about school during the pandemic.
• Since coming back to school in person, we like being with our teacher and really
liked the field trip to release the salmon.
What works best to support your learning?
• When teachers go step by step when starting something new, especially math.
• Peace and quiet.
How do students work through problems here at Sunnyland?
• Talking to adults about small problems and big problems.
• Taking deep breaths.
• Going to a spot to calm down.
• Telling a friend who can help you out.
• Compromise.
• Walk away and come back later to work through the problem.
• Room 217 is a good resource for time away and to collect our thoughts.
Dr. Baker thanked everyone for being here this afternoon. Student voice is important and
helps the school board and district determine how to make things better.
