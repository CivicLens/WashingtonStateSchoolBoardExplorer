Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:

One of the requirements for receiving state construction assistance funding for Sehome High School is for the district to conduct
a constructability review of the project documents. The process involves reviewing the plans and specifications associated with
the project in order to identify errors, ambiguities, omissions, discrepancies, and conflicts that could become potential problem
areas during the construction phase and result in costly change orders and/or claims.
The process included a detailed review of the plans and specifications by our GC/CM Dawson team (combination of
Preconstruction Manager; Project Manager; Superintendent; Estimator and Project Executive) as well as architectural, civil,
structural, mechanical, electrical and plumbing consultants.
The process will result in the design team revising portions of the drawings and specifications where problem areas were
identified, producing a clean set of plans for bidders. Mr. Cowan and Mr. Lawyer have reviewed the report and responses with
the design team. A copy of the report is attached.

Explanation of Issue:
As discussed previously, we have identified a building to become our new Central Kitchen. This building is located adjacent to
our district warehouse on Alpine Way. It is sized such that it will meet our immediate needs and provide room to expand if and
when meal participation increases.
We have completed our due diligence including a building inspection, title review, phase 1 environmental site assessment (ESA)
and have concluded the building and site will satisfactorily meet our needs.
The final purchase and sale agreement is essentially the same as the draft agreement you reviewed earlier with the one
exception being the sale price has been reduced from $1,750,000 to $1,670,000 to reflect the results of the fair market value
appraisal and the results of the building inspection.
By approving the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the board is authorizing the Superintendent to execute all necessary
documents to close on the purchase of the building.
Pending board action, we will work with a planning committee and our architects to design the necessary tenant improvements
including utility upgrades, equipment placement, heating and ventilation, etc.
Funding for this proposed purchase comes from the Districts Capital Projects Fund.
