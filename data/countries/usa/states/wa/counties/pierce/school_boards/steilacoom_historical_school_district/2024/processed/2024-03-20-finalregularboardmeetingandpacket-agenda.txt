Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

From: Shawn Lewis
Subject: Financial Update
Attached are the Budget Status Reports for all funds as of the end of February 2024, along with
charts and data showing our monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund cash
balance.
Enrollment is generally flat – no significant increase or decrease in our schools or in the Running
Start program. We continue to have over 200 FTE enrolled in Running Start – and our Pierce
County invoice due for 1st Semester was just received and is over $600,000, consistent with our
expectation.
General Fund balance as of the end of February is $1,730,966.
Capital Projects Fund balance is nearly $295,000 as we begin receiving capital projects and
technology levy proceeds following last November’s successful election. In May, I anticipate
transferring about $1.6 million from the capital projects fund to the debt service fund for future
payment of the McNeil Street property.
No items of significance to report in other funds.
Overall cash flow remains low but acceptable – and we do not anticipate needing an interfund
loan this year.
The auditor’s office is on schedule to complete their audit and schedule an exit conference this
month. I should be able to provide an Audit Summary for the board at the April Board Meeting.

C. Legislative Update
Director Rohrer shared a legislative update regarding bill timelines. The House budget for K-12
was shared yesterday, with increases in several areas. Senate Bill 2494 increases state funding
for operating costs. Senate Bill 2180 increases the special education enrollment funding
cap. Additional bills in process involve SafetyNet funding, chronic absenteeism, and allowing
10th grade students to participate in Running Start in online settings.
Chair Scott asked if it was too late to add their support. Director Rohrer shared there is still time
to do that for financial bills. Director Rohrer gave a shout-out to Pioneer teacher Stephanie
Mateus, who was at the capital championing for education bills.

February 2024 Accounts Payable and January 2024 Payroll; January 17, 2024 Regular Board

B. First Reading of Policy 6550 Capitalization Threshold for Leases and Subscription-Based
Information Technology Arrangements
Assistant Superintendent Shawn Lewis shared Policy 6550 Capitalization Threshold for Leases
and Subscription-Based Informational Technology Arrangements. The state auditor's office
advised WSSDA update the policy to align with state auditor's new guidance. Specifically, this
policy revision lowers the threshold for capitalization of technology subscriptions to $20,000.
This is consistent with the capitalization threshold for other district assets. The district does not
currently have any subscription-based technology agreements that meet the capitalization
requirements, and therefore this will not have an immediate impact to the district's financial
reporting.
Director Rohrer made a motion to approve Policy 6550 Capitalization Threshold for Leases and
Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements, Director Tinsley seconded the
motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

C. Board Meeting Location
Mr. Lewis explained that the sound system that has been used for board meetings has reached
the end of its useful life. As the district explored options to replace the aging equipment, holding
meetings at the district's Professional Development Center was discussed as an option that
would significantly reduce district costs in terms of both equipment and of ongoing staff time
spent preparing and tearing down board meetings at school locations.
Director Lewis shared moving equipment is difficult and is not conducive to a lengthy lifespan of
the equipment. He voiced a question about the visibility of the board to the community, Dr.
Weight shared the board's goal for the year, which is to be more present at evening activities
throughout the district. Director Lewis stated he was going to share that same information, and
he supports moving to the PDC for meetings as the board needs to be present at events
throughout the district.
Director Tinsley asked if we would provide recordings of board meetings. Dr. Weight shared we
already do that on the district's website.
Director Rohrer asked what other districts do. Mr. Lewis shared he has not done an extensive
survey, but to his knowledge most districts have a specific place where they hold board
meetings.
Director Tinsley asked if those attending via Zoom would be able to make comments. Chair Scott
shared this topic has previously been addressing, and that option would require an additional
staff member to monitor the chat. He shared community members can share their comments in
writing, and those comments will become part of the public record.
Dr. Weight shared the board can approve this decision now, and then reevaluate in June when
they approve the board meeting calendar for 2024-25 school year.
Director Rohrer made a motion to authorize the superintendent to amend the board meeting
calendar moving meeting locations to the district's Professional Development Center from
March through August 2024, Director McDonald seconded the motion, and the motion passed
(5/0).
D. Board Retreat
After board discussion, Director McDonald made a motion to hold a Board Retreat on Tuesday,
March 26, at 1:00 p.m., held at the district's Professional Development Center; Director Tinsley
seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
E. Committee for Strategic Investments in School District Facilities
In late 2023, the Board approved a plan to engage the community in a process to make
recommendations to the Superintendent and Board regarding strategic investments in school
district facilities. Specifically, the committee will make recommendations on the priorities and
funding amounts for future bond and capital levy proposals to meet the needs of students. At
the board’s direction, the district solicited for committee volunteers to find 20 individuals who
represent a broad cross-section of the community. The district received a very good response
and now has 27 individuals who are interested in serving. The district is asking the board to
designate two members to be given the authority to review the list and select the final 20
members for the committee.
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

Page 4 of 6

Packet page 94 of 169

Chair Scott shared there would be wisdom of having one board member who resides in
Steilacoom and one board member who resides in DuPont be responsible for selecting the final
members of the committee.
Director Rohrer made a motion to authorize Directors Scott and Lewis to approve the final list of
members appointed to the Committee for Strategic Investments in School District Facilities,
Director McDonald seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
Director Rohrer asked for clarification on whether board members would be part of the
committee. Mr. Lewis shared the committee will consist of community members only.
F. Board Goal - Professional Learning
The Board established professional learning goals for the 2023-24 school year based on the
most recent Board self-evaluation process. This agenda item will become a “standing” item at
our Regular Board Meetings to provide an opportunity for Board members to discuss and share
around their goals.
Chair Scott shared an article surrounding mistakes board members may make. He will forward
this article to the board, with the goal of helping the board be a better functioning board.
Director Tinsley shared she read an article surrounding Chromebooks.
Director Rohrer shared information regarding moving cell phones from the classroom. She is
proud of the work our administrators are doing in this regard. She also shared a survey on
school boards, and one of the focus items was communities wanting their boards to focus on
student achievement outcomes. She thanked our teachers for all the work they do in the
classrooms, where all the amazing stuff happens.
VII. BOARD COMMUNICATION
Chair Scott shared he received communication from Mike Winkler regarding a community
member's experience. He referred the parent to the school's principal.
Chair Scott shared the Board of Directors received communication highlighting two staff
members - Trina McJunkins from Pioneer Middle School and Sabine Sickles from the District's IT
Department.
From JoAnne Fernandes, Pioneer Middle School Principal - I am excited to recognize Trina
McJunkins from Pioneer MS as an exceptional special education teacher and athletic

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Cherrydale HVAC Unit Replacement Bid Award
After the successful passage of the Capital Facilities and Technology Levy in 2023, the District began
preparing for its first major project – the replacement of the heating and ventilation system at Cherrydale
Primary School. The District developed project specifications and released a bid, including advertising in a
local publication as required by law.
The scope of the project, as listed in the bid documents, is: Replacing (23) rooftop units, (1) mini split, (5)
indoor split system units, electrical and BAS controls connections, startup/commissioning, ensuring equal or
better operations and functions in comparison to existing mechanical equipment and controls capabilities as
well as ensuring the current integrity of the building, building envelope and/or all existing building materials.
Bids were opened on February 28. Four bids were received - only three met the bid requirements. The
lowest responsive bidder was determined to be Capital Heating and Cooling, having submitted a timely bid
and meeting all requirements.
The recommended bid is $583,700. This is well below our original estimates. Shae Emery oversaw the
process, evaluated the bids, and is recommending the award to Capital Heating and Cooling.
Any excess funding available from this project is currently planned for allocation to HVAC needs at Chloe
Clark or for HVAC controls in other schools.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Approve and accept the bid from Capital Heating and Cooling and authorize the District to enter into a
contract for the replacement of Cherrydale HVAC Units as documented.

Dear Contractor,

Thank you for your interest in supporting public education by providing a bid on a
project in our District. Your work will help to make our buildings safe for our students

Because we are a public entity and will use tax dollars to fund this project, we are
required to follow a number of state and federal laws to ensure proper spending of that
money. Our processes are audited by the State Auditor’s Office. To this end, we have a
number of forms for you to fill out and submit to us before and after the project. Failure
to submit forms to the proper agency will affect payment. As a public school district,
please know that all projects are subject to prevailing wage requirements. .
SHSD has staff who are very willing to help you through this process. If you have
questions or concerns regarding this process, please contact me.
Again, thank you for sharing your expertise with us. We look forward to working with
you.

Sincerely,
Shawn Lewis

STEILACOOM HISTORICAL SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF DIRECTORS
Board Meeting Date: March 20, 2024
Strategic Focus Area

☐ Achieve

☒ Support
☐ Connect
☐ Plan

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Research clearly shows that early engagement with families in the educational process, along with
creating individual connections with students prior to the start of instruction, leads to better
educational outcomes.
The district would like to continue the use of the first two days of the school year to meet with first
through fifth grade students and their families in “Success Conferences”. We believe that these
conferences have helped set the stage for a better learning environment and higher academic
achievement.
While there is a requirement to provide 180 days of instruction for all students, parent teacher
conferences may be conducted in lieu of these days if a waiver is submitted to the state
accompanied by a board resolution.
While the district has other school conference days in the school calendar, a resolution and waiver
request is only required when districts use a full day for parent teacher conferences.
This proposal has been discussed with our school principals and with the Steilacoom Education
Association, and both groups support the proposal and the focus on connecting directly with
students and families before the school year starts.
The accompanying resolution authorizes the superintendent to submit a waiver request for two days
of Success Conferences in grades 1 through 5.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Staff recommends passage of resolution 920-03-20-24 authorizing the superintendent to submit a
waiver request to use instructional days for parent/family/teacher conferences.
Report prepared by:
Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent

511 Chambers Street
Steilacoom, WA 98388
Resolution No. 920-03-20-24
Parent/Family/Teacher Conferences – Waiver Request
WHEREAS, Steilacoom Historical School District seeks a two (2) day waiver from the 180-day
calendar for elementary schools within the District for the purpose of implementing full-day
parent/family/teacher conferences; and
WHEREAS, the Steilacoom Historical School District has reviewed research which suggests a
strong correlation between early family engagement and direct connections with students early in the
school year; and
WHEREAS, the school district will continue to meet the minimum instructional hour requirements
for all students within the school district; and
WHEREAS, the SHSD educators believe that these parent/family/teacher conferences will lead to
improved behavior, social emotional learning, and academic achievement in the long term; and
WHEREAS, the waiver supports increased academic achievement and allows for longer and more
meaningful dialogue and conferences than open house nights at the beginning of the school year; and
WHEREAS, these additional conferences permit the inclusion of more parents, families, and
students in conferences and reduce the burden of families who may have other family responsibilities
in the evening when traditional open house or other family connection opportunities have been made
available;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Steilacoom Historical School District Board of
Directors authorizes the superintendent to:
• Submit a waiver request for two (2) days from the 180-day school year requirement for
elementary schools for the 2024-25, 2025-26 and the 2026-27 school years, to permit these
schools to hold parent/family/teacher conferences on the first two days of the school year;
• Notify students that they are not required to attend school on those days accept to attend the
conferences with their parents and families; and
• Provide assurances that the District will comply with the annual average requirement for
instructional hours.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Steilacoom Historical School District Board of Directors
authorizes the Superintendent to take other actions deemed necessary to implement these conferences
in accordance with this resolution.
Adopted by a majority of the Board of Directors of Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 at the
Regular Board Meeting held on March 20, 2024.

Parent-Teacher Conference Days Waiver
School districts can waive up to five (5) school days during the regular 180-day school year for the
purpose of conducting parent-teacher conferences. The waiver can be effective for up to three
years and is renewable. The district must continue to meet the annual instructional hour
requirement described in RCW 28A.150.220. A district seeking a waiver solely for the purpose of
parent-teacher conference days may do so by providing notification to the Office of
Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) at least 30 days prior to implementation.
A district seeking a waiver for more than five conference days or for reasons other than parentteacher conference days, must request a waiver through a different 180-day School Year Waiver
process. For questions, please email at waivers@k12.wa.us.

The parent-teacher conference days waiver notification must include all of these items:
1. Waiver Form: 180-day Waiver Form for Parent-Teacher Conference Days (see next page).
2. Adopted resolution, approved and signed by the school district board of directors,
including:
a. The number of school days designated for parent-teacher conferences (no more than
five school days).
b. The school years for which the waiver will be implemented (up to three school years).
c. An attestation stating that the district will meet the minimum instructional hours
requirement of RCW 28A.150.220(2) under the waiver plan.
3. Proposed school year calendar(s) indicating which days are planned for conferences.

Please submit the Parent-Teacher Conference Days Waiver notification to OSPI, via
email: waivers@k12.wa.us
Waiver notifications must be submitted to OSPI at least 30 days before implementation. OSPI staff
will review the district’s waiver submittal to ensure all items have been included. When the review is
complete, a letter will be emailed to the district concerning the parent-teacher conference days
waiver plan.
Renewals: If the school district would like to renew an expiring parent-teacher conference days
waiver, the renewal notification must follow the same process as described above.
For questions, please email at waivers@k12.wa.us.
