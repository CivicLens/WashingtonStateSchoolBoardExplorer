2.10 Grant Driveway Easement

Meeting :

Mar 19, 2015 - Regular Meeting, 6:15 p.m., March
19, 2015

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the recommendation outlined below in
connection with a proposed driveway easement on a small
piece of district-owned property in the vicinity of Whatcom
Middle School. As Superintendent, I have reviewed and
approved this recommendation and am submitting it as a
consent agenda item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
At your September 11, 2014 meeting you authorized the hiring of an appraiser to appraise the value of a small piece of property located
south of Halleck Street near Whatcom Middle School as the first step in resolving a matter associated with ingress and egress to an
adjacent private residential property. The portion of the district-owned parcel is approximately 8 feet wide and 75 feet long as shown in
Exhibit 'C' in the attached document titled 'Driveway Easement'. The appraisal was completed in November 2014 and the market value
of the proposed easement is $3,145.
By way of background, the owner of a home located immediately adjacent to the parcel has used the property for many years as a
driveway(as have previous owners)and alleges that a prescriptive easement over the parcel arose prior to the time the district acquired
the property in 1961. The homeowner is requesting the district grant a non-exclusive driveway easement for ingress, egress, parking,
and utilities over the property. The attached Area Exhibit shows the location of the home in green and the driveway in blue (the pink
area shows the E Street vacation which took place in 1915).

At this point we have two options. The first is to make the property owner prove his claim in court that a prescriptive easement has been
established. The second option is to settle the matter by granting the proposed easement which includes compensation for the
easement and payment of all cost and attorneys fees incurred by the district. We have reviewed this matter with our legal counsel, Phil
Sharpe.
I recommend granting the attached driveway easement. Granting the easement does not impair or alter our use of the property and we
would incur additional legal fees in defending the matter.

Engineering Study

Meeting :

Mar 19, 2015 - Regular Meeting, 6:15 p.m., March 19,
2015

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

As outlined below, staff has recommended acceptance of the
value engineering study and implementation plan to meet
state requirements in connection with the Happy Valley
Elementary school construction project. As Superintendent, I
have reviewed and approved this recommendation and am
submitting it as a consent agenda item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer, Capital Projects Manager
Explanation of Issue:
One of the requirements for receivingstate construction funds for our Happy Valley Elementary School
project is value engineering. Specifically, the district must complete a value engineering study and the
board must accept the report and the implementation plan.
The goal of value engineering is to optimize both cost and performance in a facility. The organized multidisciplinary approach seeks to identify items that add cost without contributing to the function of the
facility. In addition, the process can identify items that add cost but do contribute to the function of the
facility. In evaluating the quality, use, life, appearance, and required features of a facility, the value
engineering team attempts to achieve value without reducing quality below required levels while
maximizing function.
A summary of the items we are recommending for implementation (BSD comments On VA
Implementation 3-6-15.pdf) is attached.

Kevin Flanagan, one of the design team architects, and Curtis Lawyer, Capital Projects Manager, will be
in attendance to answer any questions related to the study.
A copy of the Value Engineering Study (Happy Valley -VEFinal Report 3-10-15.pdf) has been added to
the BoardDocs Library General Section.
I recommend approval of the Happy Valley Elementary Value Engineering Study.
