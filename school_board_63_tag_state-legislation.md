## 2024-03-25 - BLAINE_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Blaine School District No. 503 board meeting held on March 25, 2024, included discussions on various policies and legislative updates. President Freeman expressed concerns regarding SB5462 and HB2331, both of which have passed the legislature and await the governor's signature. SB5462 mandates specific curriculum topics, including LGBTQ content, while HB2331 allows the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) to withhold funding for noncompliance with curriculum mandates. This raised issues regarding parental rights, particularly with the potential need to amend Policy 3230, which restricts parental access to certain student information for students aged 13 and older. The board also discussed the importance of community engagement and the need for transparency in educational practices, as reflected in the ongoing legislative session.
