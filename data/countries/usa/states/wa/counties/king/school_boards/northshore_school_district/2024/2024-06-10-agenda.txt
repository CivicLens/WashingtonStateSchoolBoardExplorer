COMMENT

Type :

Information

Public Content
Summary:
The Northshore School District Board of Directors has set aside a period of up to 60 minutes to receive updates and comments
fromDistrictassociation leaders and community members.As referenced in multiple policies adopted by The Board, we expect all parties
addressing the Board to present their comments in a way that is civil and respectful. This means that whether we are school directors,
district staff, students, members of the community, or some other guest, we must all follow the same standard of civility during school board
meetings. Please speak directly to the Board and address matters related to district operations, policies, procedures, and agenda items
under consideration by the Board.

Washington State law requires that the Board limit its business and discussionat the Board meetingto onlythoseitems that have been
captured in the previously published agenda. What that means for us today:
Any public comment regarding itemsthat are includedin the published agenda will be taken into consideration by the Board when the
topic is addressed during the agenda.
Any topics brought up during public comment that are notincludedin the published agenda cannot, by law, be discussed at this
meeting and so will not be addressed or receive a response during the meeting.
In either case, depending on the nature ofyourtopic or questions,a district employee or a board member will follow up onany comments that
relate to district business.Please note that the boards silence during public comment is neutral. It is neither a signal of agreement nor
disagreement with the speakers remarks.
Also please note that comments should not make referenceto any employee or representative of the Districtby name or by identifiable
reference.If you are interested in makingcomments or complaints regardingan individual, you may use thecomplaint process available
through the Office of the Superintendent.
Finally, please remember that your words have impact and you, not the school district, are responsible for your words. We caution all
speakers that it is possible that your statements could violate the rights of others under various laws, including laws protecting privacy and
laws prohibiting defamation. If you are unsure of the legal effect of your remarks, you should seek independent legal advice. In any case, we
ask that you help us model for our students what a respectful and inclusive community looks and sounds like.

Summary:

High School ELA Novels Collection- Supplemental Curriculum for 9-12 ELA-The intended use of these
materials is to enhance the English Language Arts (ELA) curriculum by integrating novels that reflect
diverse perspectives and underrepresented voices. These novels will be utilized in classrooms through
whole class instruction or literary groups, facilitating a more inclusive and empathetic learning
environment. The ELA Novel Study Committee has carefully selected these titles to achieve the following
objectives: varied representation, critical thinking and empathy, relevant and high-interest context,
diverse characters without tokenism and authentic voices. Overall, the use of these materials aims to
create a more inclusive, engaging, and thought-provoking ELA curriculum that prepares students to think
critically, empathize with others, and appreciate the richness of diverse perspectives.
Peer Physics - Core Curriculum for 8-12 Physics - PEER physics is a POGIL (Process Oriented Guided
Inquiry Learning) curriculum that is designed to match the guidelines set forth in the NGSS (Next
Generation Science Standards). It is an introductory physics curriculum that focuses on learning physics
through evidence. The professional development part of the curriculum encourages the teaching style to
change from a teacher centered class structure to a student centered classroom.
Chemistry Course Companion for 11-12 IB Chemistry - New edition of a previously approved textbook.
