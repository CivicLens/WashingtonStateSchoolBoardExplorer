July 18, 2024 – District Office, 1985 Barkley Blvd., Bellingham, WA.
Call to Order/Land Acknowledgment:
Mr. Benjamin (President) called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. He acknowledged that
this meeting is being held on ancestral homelands of the Lummi people and Nooksack
tribe.
Roll Call:
Present: Directors Douglas Benjamin (President), Camille Diaz Hackler, Jenn Mason,
Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder). Director Scott
Ritchey was unable to attend the meeting.
Audience:
• Tarra Hollins, the grandparent of an elementary student, spoke about her kindergarten
granddaughter being put on the school bus by mistake at the beginning of the 2023-24
school year.
• Keith Allex, a district maintenance employee, thanked Dr. Baker and the school
board for the work that they do. He asked that more district SEIU maintenance
employees be hired, rather than independent contractors.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Summer programs are in progress, some in person and some online. Dr. Baker shared
photos from the BEATS program, which is in its last year due to the funding going
away.
• Roosevelt Elementary School was just authorized as an International Baccalaureate
(IB) school, and Dr. Baker outlined where other schools are in the IB authorization
process.
• An update was given on some capital projects, including:
o The award of $2.7 million for solar arrays at five schools.
o An irrigation project at Northern Heights Elementary School.
o Replacement of boilers and water heaters at Bellingham High School.
o He shared architect drawings for the future Community Transitions building at
Whatcom Community College.
• City of Bellingham and Whatcom County leadership shared this week that they are
facing budget challenges. Dr. Baker noted that the draft budget for 2024-25 has been
shared with the community. He has been asked what can be done to influence the
governor and the legislature to change the school funding model. It has been

recommended by the Washington Association of School Administrators (WASA) that
districts in the State of Washington have common talking points, which include fully
funding special education, pupil transportation and MSOCs (Materials, Supplies and
Operating Costs). Local levy money is used for these three areas, and WASA has
asked that those three areas be emphasized. Other areas that need to be addressed by
the state include:
o Increased costs of utilities and insurance.
o An update to the staffing model.
o Fixing the regionalization formula.
o Addressing the experience factor for staff.

•

Dr. Baker shared a draft of a tool to use with legislators and the community and
responded to questions from the board.
At the next regular school board meeting the board will be asked to adopt the 2024-25
budget. Please direct any questions about the proposed budget to Dr. Baker.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The superintendent already had a smooth process to maintain continuity across our schools. This
year there is evidence of increased frequency, breadth of areas of focus and a number
of current/timely topics. There is evidence that the superintendent’s efforts in leadership
development are paying off for the district. The superintendent has done a very good job of
making sure the district has new leaders in the pipeline. Continuity of leadership depth is clearly
apparent.
There is evidence of further development and expansion of plans/systems for emergency
preparedness and safety. Additional noteworthy accomplishments: Continued principal-only
meetings, with focus for secondary leaders around Universal Design for Learning (UDL), success
in the Aspiring Administrator cohorts with 60% from the program being in administrative
leadership positions, and Universal Design and Brain Development also highlight that the
district’s inclusionary work is a priority at every level and across the district.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
None identified.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
From a broad perspective, it is impressive to see how The Bellingham Promise continues to be
instilled and integrated into the fabric and culture of every school, with daily reference by staff
and students, from curricula to leadership. The board is impressed with the higher percentage of
students meeting standards on the Smarter Balanced Assessment. We are also pleased with the
support many students and families have been given, all over the district.
The following are examples of notable accomplishments this past year:
• Inclusion work at Columbia, including all students learning to use a Core Board at Columbia.
• Prioritizing inclusionary work across the district, even through budgetary challenges.
• Graduation rates post-COVID look promising. The long-term improvements continue to be
impressive.
• Minor (but important!) improvement in math scores.
• Work to improve learning around outdoor education and sustainability.
• Significant, continued work around meaningfully implementing the Since Time Immemorial
curriculum and Treaty Day learnings.
• So many arts offerings and highlights, including the “relaxed performance,” which helps
create access for audiences with sensory or other needs.
• Impressive work around multilingual learners across multiple schools.

Great to see Latinos in Action leading assemblies at all high schools and how that class is so
successful in its work.
Heartwarming stories of being principled at Northern Heights (and across the district).
The explicit teaching of pro-social thought and self-regulation is a commendable example of
the tactical efforts required to advance the broader goals of the Promise.
District growth in reading, based on the i-Ready report shows commendable growth and
achievement broadly.
The option for middle school compacted math is a good example of providing additional
challenge to students interested and motivated to do so. The use of online tools is a
commendable creative complement to in-class instruction within the budget constraints of the
system.
The district commitment to helping students engage through inquiry complex topics with
multiple developing skills is outstanding, and the work on identity, compassion and historical
understanding of tribal sovereignty is commendable.
The 5th grade strings program is an example of Bellingham leadership in music education and
a commendable commitment of the district and community to outstanding depth in this effort.
Strength of seven-year graduation rate.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
There is evidence that the district is back on track increasing progress in many areas following the
impact of the pandemic. We look forward to this continuing. While an issue across the state as a
result of COVID, we will be interested to see how attendance rates can be improved over the
coming years. While real challenges exist and efforts have been made to facilitate continuity in
music education through middle school, the district has the opportunity to continue consideration
of creative approaches that support students with simultaneous interests in topics currently
covered by electives. While there are obvious broader issues at play, the board would like to see
attendance rates reflect at least the state average. Would love to see the music and arts bottleneck
that happens in middle school shift. While there are known challenges in making this happen, the
current structure disincentivizes participation in the arts at that level – a time that’s so crucial for
developing a lifelong appreciation for the experience of creativity.
4. Comments on the report itself.
Appreciate focusing on a single school (Columbia) as an example, as well as a plethora of other
specific examples, particularly regarding knowledge and character outcomes. This helps get a
sense of the broad scope of the work. The combination of qualitative and quantitative information
in the report is helpful and well prepared, and it enables a more effective board review.
