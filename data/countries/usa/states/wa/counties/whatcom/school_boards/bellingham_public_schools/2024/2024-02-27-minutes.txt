Meeting Purpose – Explanation of Student Roundtable: Mr. Benjamon thanked
everyone for taking the time to be here this afternoon.
Student roundtables give the school board an opportunity to strengthen the connection
with our students, and the school board is excited to hear what students have to say about
their experiences. Four table groups each held conversations, using the following
questions as a guide:
•
•
•

In looking at The Bellingham Promise, what stands out for you as important?
Which core beliefs do you see emphasized in GSA?
What do you love about GSA?

What are some things you would like adults to know about what it is like to be an
LGBTQ+ middle school student?
What are the biggest differences between elementary school and middle school?
What is one thing that surprised you about middle school?
What can we do to improve the middle school experience?
What are your current hopes and dreams for the future?

At the end of the small group time, Ms. Brawley asked each group to share briefly what
they had discussed. Following are highlights from the groups:
First table:
• The students agreed that all children should be loved, and two students expressed
that they felt more loved in elementary school than middle school.
• Sometimes other students use dehumanizing language.
• Elementary school felt safer because students felt more connected to the adults.
• In elementary school, time was spent teaching students that you should love
yourself and other people, but that is not heard as often in middle school.
• Additional funding for support is needed.
Second table:
• GSA provides a place that feels safe, which is important to the students.
• It can be scary to be LGBTQ+ in school.
• We’ve had interactions with students who might be homophobic and/or
transphobic.
• Using the restrooms can be uncomfortable for students. They would advocate for
more gender-neutral restrooms.
• Adult relationships are important. Trusted adults can help students feel safe when
they have something going on that makes them feel unsafe. Knowing that adults
will respond to help them is important.
• Gender neutral restrooms are not located in good places within the school, as they
are too visible.
• Many students use the gender-neutral restrooms for unsafe activities, which
means they’re not always available for those who need them.
• Many LGBTQ+ students don’t use the gender-neutral restrooms because it feels
unsafe, and the other restrooms are not much better.
Third table:
• GSA Club is a refuge and an important part of a student’s experience. It’s safe,
fun and feels like a family.
• The GSA events give us something to look forward to.
• Outside of the 45 minutes of GSA Club, it’s hard to be an LGBTQ+ student.
• School staff can play a big part in helping students navigate difficult times.
• It’s important to know that when harmful incidents occur, school staff will help
educate students and other staff.

It would be great to hear about queer people in history classes and learn about
significant, successful people who identify as LGBTQ+ in school.

Fourth table:
• Reflecting on The Bellingham Promise, students agree with the core beliefs of
compassion building community and that together we achieve more than alone.
• GSA Club gives us a sense of belonging.
• We have many stories of fear and being singled out, and GSA Club provides a
counterpoint to those feelings.
• We wish more attention could be given to the social and emotional well-being of
students.
• There are times that lunch and break times do not feel safe. It’s hurtful when other
students identify a space as “the gay place.”
Ms. Brawley thanked everyone for being here this afternoon. Student voice is important
and helps the school board and district determine how to make things better. School
board members also expressed their appreciation for students being open and willing to
share their experiences.
Mr. Benjamin adjourned the meeting at 3:05 p.m.
