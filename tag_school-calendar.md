## 2013-02-28 - BELLINGHAM_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS (Minutes)

The Bellingham School Board meeting minutes detail the presentation and discussion surrounding the district's school calendar (EL-8). Executive Administrator Rob McElroy and Executive Director Nora Klewiada outlined the three key areas EL-8 addresses: optimizing instructional time, providing professional development opportunities for staff, and ensuring timely communication of calendar information to stakeholders. The board reviewed the multi-step process for calendar development, which involves a committee comprising certificated staff, principals, students, parents, and district representatives.  The recommended calendar is presented to the superintendent before being brought to the Board of Directors for adoption. The board expressed appreciation for the comprehensive summary but will assess whether the superintendent is in compliance with EL-8 at their March 14th meeting. Additionally, the minutes highlight upcoming community engagement events focused on facilities planning and note that several board members will attend the WASA/WSSDA Legislative Conference.
