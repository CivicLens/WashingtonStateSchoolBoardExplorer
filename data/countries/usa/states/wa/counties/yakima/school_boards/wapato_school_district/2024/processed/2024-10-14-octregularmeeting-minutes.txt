Superintendent's Report: Kelly Garza, Superintendent, reported:
• Two Wapato HS students have been selected to serve on the OSPI Migrant Student Advisory Council.
They are Juniors Karen and Hailey Trejo. Most of their participation will be via virtual meetings and
in the Spring they will visit OSPI and meet with Superintendent Rykdell.
• Last week was the 1st Dinner Parent Engagement night. The event provided Language and Literacy
Information and hosted more than 300 people. The night featured breakout sessions managed by
Administrative Interns of interactive parent and student engagement regarding data and
assessment. Mr. Garza was pleased with the great attendance and thanked all administrators that
play a role in the planning, organizing and making the event a success such as Shawn Thurman and
Mike Balmelli.
• He had the opportunity to stop by the WELCOME Preschool Fall Experience Day last week on
Thursday. He said the event was huge success and Ken Olden will provide more details during his
report. Mr. Garza thanked all who volunteered.
• He attended the Filipino Hall community event on Saturday. The event celebrated the national
recognition of the Filipino Hall as a Historic Site. Ben Newell and Maria Batarao joined Mr. Garza
along with many other community members. The program featured traditional Filipino food and
dances, specifically performances by Wapato Students. Mr. Garza shared a publication distributed at
the event with historical data and information about the site.
Construction Update - Kevin Hill, Executive Director, was not present and Superintendent Garza
reported on his behalf.
The replacement of the WHS well is projected to cost $980,000. The District has submitted for a grant to
help cover the cost of the necessary project. The Department of Commerce has fallen behind schedule
and is expected to announce recipients on October 20th. However, the District is prepared to move
forward with the project with or without the grant. The Board engaged in discussion with Sylvia Bazan
regarding cost and funding for the project. She said the well is a priority and must get completed
regardless of grant and provided financial solutions if grant is not awarded. The District is hopeful and
awaiting the announcement of grant recipients to make financial decisions.

The District has received a draft of Ed Specs for the proposed square footage of the new PACE HS
building is 23,278 sq. ft. He noted, Wapato Online Academy will continue to be housed at PACE. He
talked about what is included and the possible different classroom sizes and other rooms such as the
gym, more student bathrooms, redesign of the locker room and more bleacher seating. He reported
Javier Rodriguez, Kevin Hill, and our HVAC Team will meet this week with ALCS Architect and Absher
Construction to review mechanical and electrical systems for PACE. Mr. Garza reported the next PACE
Design Team meeting is on Wednesday at the District office at 4:30pm. The Board engaged in discussion
regarding wanting to see the final specifications and or view/walk the site to help envision the new
school and size.
Mr. Garza informed the District is still working on the final contract recommendation with the Architect
and Construction. The tentative agreement is currently pending review by District legal counsel to
assure the needs of the district are met.
