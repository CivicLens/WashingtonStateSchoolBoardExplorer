Recommended Action :

That the Board accepts the donations for construction,

purpose of constructing a covered baseball and fastpitch

Goals :

Goal 4: Voices and Partnerships

Public Content
Submitted by:

Brian Lewis, Executive Director of Operations
Background Information:

The Joey Dettrich Baseball Foundation wishes to donate the construction of a covered batting cage building to be located within the athletic
complex at Arlington High School. Donation of the building would allow skill building for both baseball and fastpitch teams. The attached site
map shows the location, dimensions, and conceptual appearance of the facility.
Administrative Considerations:

Arlington High School administration and athletic department staff support accepting the donation. District
staff will provide oversight during all phases of construction from permitting to close out. Construction
would ideally occur during the winter when demand for access to the area of work would be at its lowest.
Budgetary Impact:

There is no cost anticipated to the district at this time other than staff time to represent the district during
construction.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:

Board approval at this time would allow construction to begin in a timeframe that would be least disruptive
to spring sports.

10. REGULAR MEETING - Consent Agenda
Subject :

G. Approval of AHS Athletics Purchase of Pole Vault
Pit from Richey Athletics

Meeting :

Oct 28, 2024 - Board of Directors Study Session and
Regular Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the purchase of a pole vault pit
for Arlington High School from Richey Athletics in the
approximate amount of $40,000.00 plus sales tax, as

presented.

Public Content
Submitted by:
Tom Roys, Athletic Director, Arlington High School
Background Information:

The current pole vault pit being used at the Arlington High School track was purchased many years ago
and needs to be updated to meet safety standards and accommodate the redesign of the pole vault area
done when the track was resurfaced. This new pit allows both jumpers and vaulters to change direction
depending on which way the wind blows, so that they will not be jumping or vaulting into a head wind.
Three quotes were obtained based on specifications for the type of pole vault pit required for the
Arlington High School track. After analysis of the three quotes, the Athletic Department selects Richey
Athletic's pole vault pit based on best price for the product, service, freight and delivery/installation costs.
Administrative Considerations:

The purchase of a new pole vault pit was anticipated and included in the design plans of the new track
that was installed at Arlington High School in 2022. The pole vault pit being recommended for purchase
from Richey Athletics, meets the specifications required by the National Federation of High School
Sports, Washington Interscholastic Activity Association and the District.
Budgetary Impact:
The pole vault pit will be purchased using Athletics 2010 ASB funds in the approximate amount of $40,000.00 plus sales tax. These ASB
funds were accumulated over time for the purpose of purchasing this pole vault pit.The price includes delivery and set up.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:
The quote received from Richey Athletics expires on October 27th. They have agreed to honor the quote until approval can be obtained by
the Board, so time is of the essence to obtain approval of this purchase.

Renewal

Meeting :

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the cooperative agreement
with Danielle Parsons as a mental health provider.

Goals :

Goal 2: Safe and Caring Environment

Public Content
Submitted by:
Kerri Helgeson, Director of Equity and Student Well-Being
Background Information:
Over the past several years, mental health services were provided to Arlington School District students who would not have received them
otherwise. Mental health counselors work continuously with 6-7students each day at all of our schoolsand engagedin several mental health
triage situations. Mental health support has been an increasing need across the District and is identified as a priority for Arlington students.
These are the same contracted mental health services as in previousyears, and would becontracted by PHD#3 to provide services.
Administrative Considerations:
The district will provide space for each mental health counselor in their respective buildings to meet with students, staff, and families, in
exchange for services at no cost to the families. PHD#3 has a separate agreement with each mental health counselor to reimburse them for
services that cannot be billed, or the difference between insurance reimbursement and cost for service.
Budgetary Impact:
There will be no fiscal impact to the district by engaging in this cooperative agreement.

Background Information:

Arlington School District and Public Hospital District No. 3 reviewed the results of the 2023 Healthy Youth
Survey and agreed that there is a need to educate students and their parents/guardians regarding youth
substance abuse, misuse, and prevention. In order to address these needs, the Hospital District and the
School District have agreed to work together to create a coalition for support of healthier and more
resilient youth.
Administrative Considerations:

As part of this agreement, the School District will create a supplemental contract with the Hospital District
to compensate the School District for the Director of Equity and Student Well-Being's time, support, and
involvement in the development of educational programs/activities regarding youth substance abuse,
misuse, and prevention.
Budgetary Impact:

The Hospital District will be invoiced monthly for the actual cost of salary and benefits of the Director of
Equity and Student Well-Being's time spent in support of the Coalition's work. This agreement ends June
30, 2025.

B. Interview of Selected Respondent to Request for
Qualifications for Architectural Services

Meeting :

Oct 28, 2024 - Board of Directors Study Session and

Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves recommendation from
Superintendent selecting McGranahan Architects as a
provider of architectural services for projects funded by the
2024 Capital Levy.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:

Brian Lewis, Executive Director of Operations
Background Information:
Policy 6925 requires the District to perform a Request for Qualifications process for the acquisition of architectural services. As part of this
process, the Superintendent is directed by policy to make a recommendation to the Board for selection of an architectural firm. District staff
published a Request for Qualifications and the District's Facilities Advisory Committee recently reviewed Statements of Qualifications and
heard presentations from responding firms. The Facilities Advisory Committee scored the responses to formulate a recommendation to the
Superintendent. The recommendation to the Superintendent is to re-engage with McGranahan Architects for services related to design and
construction of projects funded by the 2024 Capital Projects Levy approved by voters in the February 2024 election. The Superintendent's
recommendation to the Board mirrors the Facilities Advisory Committee's recommendation.
Administrative Considerations:

Attached to this agenda item are McGranahan's presentation to the Facilities Advisory Committee and
their statement of qualifications.
Budgetary Impact:
The budgetary impact varies based on the level of services requested by the district but is generally 7% of a project's total cost. These costs
are funded by the 2024 Capital Levy proceeds held in the District's Capital Projects Fund.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:

Approval by the Board will allow District staff and McGranhan to begin planning projects funded by the
2024 Capital Levy, with initial projects commencing in the summer of 2025.
