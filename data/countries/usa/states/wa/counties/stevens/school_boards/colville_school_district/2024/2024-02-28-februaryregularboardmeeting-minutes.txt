E-Sports State Champions!
■

Out of 20 teams in the ESports league Statewide the Championship match came down to
two Colville Junior High School teams! So on February 6th during our 7th period
enrichment electives, we did a live stream for parents and students to watch our two
teams compete for the state championship! Parents of students competing came to
support their kids and we had a full cafeteria of students cheering on and supporting both
teams competing. It was a great match up and ultimately one team had to be the winner.

Safety Drill
○

This month’s safety drill for the district was a full lockdown drill. We administered the drill on
February 15th. Before the drill I met with staff to cover the steps we take during the lockdown drill
and I also went over the intercom right before the drill to communicate with students the
expectations of the drill. The drill was successfully completed.

High School Leadership Mentors
○

Mrs. Ressa and her leadership class will be coming down every Friday during 6th period to
support as mentors in 5 of our classrooms starting February 23rd. The goal of this plan is to allow
our 8th grade students to make connections with some of the high school students, so when they
transition to the high school they have that connection. The high school students will also lead a

Nutrition
We’ve had some dishwasher problems at schools, but maintenance has kept up with most of these issues. Right now,
it looks like our dishwasher at the High School is not usable, and we will be switching back to disposable trays. We
are looking into a grant for a replacement option and that is due mid-March.
With our Farm to School grant, we are procuring local yogurt from True North Cattle Co. out of Northport. We will
be showcasing their yogurt twice during March.
Facilities
The first week of February, Clear Risk Solutions along with members of our maintenance crew installed new
gateways and sensors in all district buildings. We have been using the sensor program for several years. The sensors
detect the presence of water, low indoor air temps, along with low pipe temperatures. The sensors have prevented
several major insurance claims. We have increased the sensor number from 25 sensors to 45 including new sensors
for the Fish Hatchery with no additional cost to the district. Thank you CLEAR RISK!
The second week of the month was spent wiring the new table saw in the CHS wood shop. The new table saw also
has the SAW STOP feature. This feature stops the blade if it were to come in contact with a body part. Very cool.
We also changed the filters for the dust collection system and worked on the shop’s exhaust system.
The third week of the month we are gearing up for spring sports. The first application of preemergant for our turf
has begun. Along with field prep, batting cage nets, fence and gate repair. We have also distributed our new
dumpsters and have had a successful first garbage run, the new truck and trash system is a game changer! We will
be able to improve safety and decrease the time it takes to take care of trash.
In the third and fourth week the west side of the CJHS gym roof will be repaired as well. We have three roof
drains/scuppers that have been an issue for a long time and will be nice to have behind us.
As usual if anyone has any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you.
6.02 Public Records Report per Policy 6030
The District has had three public records requests since the last report. Two of them were from a parent wanting
information on an incident involving their student. The third was from a company wanting district service records
involving fire suppression and hood and duct cleaning. All three records requests have been fulfilled and closed.

Kudos to the high school staff and student body for their role in Unified Sports. Unified Sports has been a huge hit
and is a great example of how programs positively impact all students. Soccer will be our spring Unified Sports
program.
The Capital Levy failed, but we still have the same facility needs. I will bring ideas and possible funding options to
the board for discussion for a long range plan.
