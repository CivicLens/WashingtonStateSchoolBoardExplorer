2nd Reading Revised Policy No. 5280 Separation from Employment
WSSDA has revised this policy to clarify the school boards role in the process of terminating
staff. The boards role differs depending on the type of employee thats being terminated. As
described, with classified employees, the board plays one role, but with certificated employees,
the board plays another. Under Policy 5280, the superintendent recommends to the board
whether a classified employee should be terminated, and the board makes the decision.Policy
5280 reflects the boards role in certificated employees terminations. The policy no longer has

the board considering notices of probable cause and rendering decisions about discharges or
non-renewals. In making those changes, WSSDA clearly delineates the different processes for
terminating certificated employees and terminating classified employees.

1st Reading Revised Policy and Procedure No. 2190/2190P - Highly Capable Programs:

Policy revised to clarify that the law does not mandate the screening of all students. Instead, school
districts are now required to universally screen students only at two elementary grade levels, rather than
screening all K-12 students annually. And added the requirement for the use of multiple objective criteria
and multiple pathways in the identification and placement decisions.
Procedure revised to comply with program placement procedures:
Referral: The district is to conduct universal screenings at two elementary grade levels to identify
students who may qualify for potential placement in the Highly Capable Program (HCP).
Screening: Universal screening must take place once in or before second grade, and again before
leaving elementary school, either in fifth or sixth grade.
Assessment: The district is now required to obtain written parental permission before conducting
additional assessments to determine eligibility for participation in the Highly Capable Program (HCP).
Furthermore, districts must use multiple objective criteria to identify students determined to b in need
of services.
Exit Process: The exit process now mandates that parents/guardians be involved in the exit meeting.

Reviewed Policy No. 2151 and Revised Procedure No. 2151P - Interscholastic Activities: Athletic
Directors; Tim Strother and Dallin Maxfield conducted a thorough review of the policy and procedure. See
attached memo describing the steps taken to ensure our policy/procedure is in compliant. The procedure
was revised to address student transportation and added additional language in section H. Transport
Athletes Safely
In addition, the District updated the parent authorization forms with input from our legal counsel for when
parents do want to transport their children to and/or from off-campus athletic events. This step was important
to help ensure that the district was released from liability when parents want to transport their children or have
someone else transport their children. The review of this policy and the accompanying procedure have helped
to address the Districts liability and leading practice concerns expressed by the board when it comes to
student athlete transportation.
