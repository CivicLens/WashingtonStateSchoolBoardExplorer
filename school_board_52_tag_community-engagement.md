## 2024-08-12 - LA_CONNER_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The La Conner School Board of Directors held a special meeting on August 12, 2024, to discuss various action items, including the adoption of several resolutions. Notably, they adopted Resolution No. 24-19, which pertains to a General Fund Budget Extension for the 2023-2024 fiscal year, allowing an increase in expenditures by $1.3 million primarily due to the receipt of the 21st Century Grant, which amounted to $425,000. The board also approved a budget extension for capital projects (Resolution No. 24-20) related to a $1.9 million Solar Grant. 

In addition, the board discussed a significant policy change regarding cell phone use in schools. Starting in the 2024-2025 school year, the district plans to implement a cell phone-free environment to enhance student engagement and mental health by reducing distractions. This initiative follows unsuccessful attempts over the past two years to limit cell phone use and aligns with practices adopted by nearby districts. The board expressed support for the policy, which aims to foster better social interactions and academic focus among students. The implementation will involve using Yondr pouches for high school students and locked cases for middle school students to store their devices during school hours. The board is seeking community feedback to facilitate a smooth transition to this new policy.

## 2024-02-12 - LA_CONNER_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The La Conner School Board held a special study meeting on February 12, 2024, where various topics were discussed, including significant policy changes and community engagement efforts. The board reviewed multiple policies for first reading, including Policy 1310 on Policy Adoption and Policy 2205 on the School Improvement Plan, which will be added for review in March. The discussion also included an update on the Student-Focused Balanced Calendar by the Mount Vernon School District, which aims to promote better balance in student, staff, and family life and address equitable outcomes due to learning loss. Community input was sought regarding the football program, following WIAA's denial of La Conner High School's petition to opt down to an 8-person team, highlighting the board's commitment to community engagement in decision-making processes. Additionally, updates on school improvement plans indicated a 6% increase in graduation rates, emphasizing the board's focus on academic standards and improving instructional practices.
