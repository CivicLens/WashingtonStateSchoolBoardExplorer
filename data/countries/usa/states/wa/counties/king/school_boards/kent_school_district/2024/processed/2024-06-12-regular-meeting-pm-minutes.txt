AGENDA ITEM:

Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Resolution No. 1677: Special Education Out-of-Endorsement Reporting

AGENDA ITEM:
Human Resources is required to annually report employees teach out-of-endorsement to the Office of the
Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) through the Educator Equity Data Collection (EEDC) tool.
The EEDC tool pulls certificate and endorsement information for educators and student data from the
Comprehensive Education Data and Research System (CEDARS) system to ensure students are
assigned to teachers with the proper endorsement.
In the best interest of students, there are times when a student may be placed in a special education
classroom prior to their IEP being finalized or submitted. This can cause the teacher, with a special
education endorsement, to appear out-of-endorsement as the student is not yet identified as requiring
special education services in CEDARS, and the EEDC tool expects them to be assigned to a general
education teacher.
Per WAC 180-82-110, out-of-endorsements must be approved through the Board of Directors. Per
direction from OSPI, this resolution is to cover all individuals specifically impacted by the above scenario
in lieu of individual out-of-endorsement reports.
BOARDGOAL:
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
Goal 4: Investing in a Diverse Workforce and Inclusive Workplace Cultures

BUDGETIMPLICATION:
The 20232024 budget reflects all funds necessary to support the FTE for these employees.

RECOMMENDATION:
That the board of directors approves this item.

Adoption of QuaverEd
AGENDA ITEM:
The purpose of this adoption is to secure resources that align to the 2016 adopted state
standards that will allow Kent School District (KSD) K-5 Physical Education teachers to teach
the standards with rigor and fidelity. In reviewing our current resource Spark, the Review Team
determined that there was not adequate alignment to current adopted state standards (2016)
and best practice research in physical education.
The Review Team reviewed various materials using the Washington state anti-bias rubric, a
curriculum alignment rubric, and at the conclusion of the process, the team recommended to the
Instructional Materials Committee (IMC) that Quaver ED be adopted.
The IMC agreed that the committee has followed the curriculum review process and
recommended that this curriculum should be approved by the board.
BOARD GOALS:
Goal 1: Preparing Students to be Global Citizens
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
The cost of the digital resources for 6 years, teacher materials and year one professional
development will be approximately $250,560.00. These budget allocations have been planned
for the 2023-2024 school year budget.
RECOMMENDATION:
The Board of Directors approves this item.

Nutrition Services Purchase of Replacement Refrigerated Trucks

AGENDA ITEM:
The Nutrition Services department is requesting the purchase of two replacement refrigerated trucks to
be used for the delivery of food to schools and other designated areas. These will be 2025 Isuzu 16,000#
gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) diesel cab-over trucks, Model #NPR-XD. The current Nutrition
Services refrigerated trucks are over 20 years old and were not purchased brand new. Nutrition Services
received five refrigerated trucks in the 2022-2023 SY, we are replacing the two remaining trucks that
were used for back up.
The purchase of these two refrigerated trucks will be made by RWC International LTD, a member of the
Washington State Department of Enterprise Services Contract Automobile Request System (WA-DES
CARS). Kent School District uses the WA-DES CARS approved quote system to obtain bids for vehicles.

These vehicles are being purchased on WA-DES Contract # 05916. Use of the WA-DES purchasing
cooperative satisfies competitive bidding requirements for purchases above the formal bid threshold
specified in WA RCW 28A.335.190.

BOARD GOAL:
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments.

BUDGET IMPLICATION:
The amount of $320,564.99, which includes sales tax, has been forecasted for the 2023-2024 school
year and will be paid from the Nutrition Services general fund.

RECOMMENDATION:
The recommendation is for the Board of Directors to authorize the district to approve this capital outlay
purchase of two Isuzu refrigerated trucks from WA-DES CARS for the Nutrition Services department at a
total cost of $320,564.99, which includes sales tax.

Kent, Washington
June 12, 2024
Title III Allocated Budget
AGENDA ITEM
Additional Title III funds have been allocated to KSD this spring that allows us to purchase previously
approved supplemental curriculum aligned to our CKLA implementation. Title III funds can only be
allocated to supplemental support for the MLE program. Per Board Policy 6220, the district used the
BuyBoard Purchasing Cooperative as our competitive process as approved by the Board located on our
external website.
Language Studio was previously approved as part of the CKLA curriculum adoption by the board in May
2023. Initially, we purchased one copy per grade level per elementary building. With this purchase each
teacher will have the appropriate grade level resource that strengthens access to language in ELA
literacy content areas during core instruction.
See policy 6220 Section F.
