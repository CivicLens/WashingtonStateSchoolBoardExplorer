2.6 Approval of Sunnyland Elementary School Value
Engineering Study

Meeting :

May 12, 2021 - Regular Board Meeting via Zoom

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff has requested approval of the value engineering
study for Sunnyland Elementary School. As
superintendent, I approve of this request.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Curtis Lawyer, Director of Capital Projects

Explanation of Issue:
A requirement for receiving state construction funds for our Sunnyland Elementary School project is value engineering. Specifically, the
district must complete a value engineering study and the board must accept the report and the implementation plan.
The goal of value engineering is to optimize both cost and performance in a facility. The organized multi-disciplinary approach (civil,
structural, mechanical, electrical) seeks to identify items for possible elimination that add cost without contributing to the function of the
facility. In addition, the process can identify items that add cost but do contribute to the function of the facility for possible inclusion. In
evaluating the quality, use, life, appearanceand required features of a facility, the value engineering team attempts to achieve value without
reducing quality below required levels, while maximizing function.
The final engineering studyand summary of the items we are recommending for implementationare attached.
