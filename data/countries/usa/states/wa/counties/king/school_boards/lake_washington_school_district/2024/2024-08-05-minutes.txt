In anticipation of the 2025 legislative session, LWSD sent messages and started building relationships with different committee leads. LWSD has provided comments on comprehensive plans for our cities.

1. Public Hearing: Adoption of the 2024-25 Budget, Resolution No. 2380
The 2024-25 draft budget was presented to the Board at the June 24, 2024, meeting. The budget was posted on the district’s website and copies were made available to interested persons. Feedback could be provided via the website or email.
The district budget document is presented in both the official F-195 state format and the district finance summary pages. The district summary format will be posted when available. The district summary document follows the Association of School Business Officials International (ASBO) Meritorious Budget Award criteria.

State statutes require the board to hold a public hearing on the budget and adopt the budget by resolution, which also establishes the tax levies necessary to support the General Fund, the Capital Projects Fund and the Debt Service Fund. The F-195, state budget format, is the official budget to be adopted. All program totals agree with the district format, which has more detailed information.
