This holds true for all programs and services. The District provides equal access to the Boy Scouts and other designated youth groups. The District offers classes in many careers and technical education program areas under our open admissions practice. Specifically, our High School offers admissions based on selective criteria in programs like the Teacher Assistant (TA) program through a separate application process that is non-discriminatory. For more information about the application process and particular CTE course offerings, contact the CTE Director or School Counselor at (509)932-4477. Lack of English language proficiency will not be a barrier to admission and participation in the career and technical education programs.
