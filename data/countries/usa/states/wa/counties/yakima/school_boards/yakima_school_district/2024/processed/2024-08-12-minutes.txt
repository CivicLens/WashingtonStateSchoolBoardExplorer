He presented on various topics, including referral requests, evaluations, data collection and consent, service provision, paraeducators, and Comprehensive Coordinated Early Intervening Services (CCEIS), as detailed in the attached presentation.

Each department participated in a 10-minute presentation rotation, sharing their top priority goals with board members:
Safety/Athletics - Sara Cordova & Nate Henyan
Maintenance - Kyle Soptich
Technology - Andy Gonzalez
CTE - Bonnie Smith, Gabe Stotz, & Nicole Bass
Human Resources - Chris Miller & Kim Newell
A Q&A session followed, during which Vice President Villanueva emphasized the importance of communicating the district's positive initiatives amid negative press regarding RIFs. He stated, "It's crucial for the community to understand that YSD is actively working on many fronts, not just eliminating staff." The presentations highlight the current state of the district across departments and are available on BoardDocs.
Overall, there has been a notable culture shift within all departments, fostering enterprise learning and collaboration.
4. Climate Survey - Andy Gonzalez, Executive Director of Technology Services
Andy Gonzalez presented on the Climate Survey. The four Executive Directors of Teaching and Learning, Dr. Lucero, Hector Mendez, Jaime Lee, and Jewel Brumley, discussed School Data Solutions and survey questions.
Concerns were raised about student interpretation of questions and response reliability. President Walker suggested obtaining feedback from the Student Fellows. The plan is to implement a condensed survey this year, with a rebound version scheduled for next year.

6. Board Topics
Calendar:
The board approved the meeting calendar as presented, with the decision to reduce retreats to two per year—scheduled for January and August. The board requested the general intent and purpose for each retreat in advance. The January retreat will primarily focus on the Superintendent's evaluation, while the August retreat will address the Board's self-evaluation.

Policy Governance:
The Board discussed tools for monitoring the board evaluation and efficiency. It was decided that we will implement an Annual Board Self-Evaluation via the WSSDA self-eval tool. With that, we will continue evaluating policies 1000.3.0 through 1000.4.4 and continue using Survey Monkey.

Recognitions:
Option 1: Recognize individuals from 6:15 to 6:45 PM, with the meeting starting at 7:00 PM.
Option 2: Hold two or three separate recognition events (not board meetings) focused solely on this, including retirees. Barb will plan this, with suggested attendance for board members and recordings available for families.
Option 3: Maintain the current approach.
The decision was made to proceed with Option 2.
Retiree Gift:
The request aligns with the district's goal to reduce costs. It is recommended to consider more financially responsible gift options, such as local restaurant gift certificates. Supt Greene and Barb will provide suggestions to the board.

AI Training for Board members will come from Supt Greene and Kirsten Fitterer.

WSSDA Conference: Who will be attending?
Supt Greene, President Walker, VP Villanueva and Director Rice would like to attend. Director Beckett will sit in for Pres Walker as needed, and Director Navarro, Jr. will let us know.
