The Blaine School District No. 503 held an emergency board meeting on March 16, 2020, to address the COVID-19 pandemic state of emergency.  The board unanimously adopted Resolution 1920-11 Emergency – Suspension of Policy, which allows for the temporary suspension of district policies during the pandemic. This resolution was recommended by the Washington State School Directors' Association (WSSDA) and is intended to streamline the district's response to the crisis. Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger explained that the resolution would enable the district to implement protocols advised by the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), such as potentially adjusting graduation requirements for high school seniors, without violating existing policies. The board emphasized that any actions taken under this resolution would be communicated to its members.

The Blaine School District No. 503 board held a work session on February 24, 2020, facilitated by Rich Parker from McPherson & Jacobson to establish performance objectives for the new superintendent.  The meeting focused on board governance best practices, including establishing clear goals aligned with WSSDA's School Board Standards, encouraging public engagement through structured meetings and forums, and fostering positive interpersonal relationships. Discussions also revolved around clarifying the role of the public during regular meetings, emphasizing the importance of avoiding "rubber-stamping" decisions, and promoting a culture of trust and accountability.  

The board discussed potential policy changes, including updating district policies to include a WIAA Point of Contact position and establishing a new Policy Representative role for overseeing policy development. They also reviewed superintendent evaluation protocols, favoring performance-based evaluations over standards-based ones. Concerns were raised regarding the special education budget being significantly overallocated for several years. The board recommended a special review of this program to gain a better understanding of its dynamics and address the funding deficit from the state.

The text details a school board meeting where several policy matters were discussed and acted upon. Notably, President Gibson abstained from voting on a facility use payment due to a potential conflict of interest stemming from his previous role as pastor at Northwood Alliance Church. This suggests a proactive effort by the president to avoid any perception of impropriety.

The board also agreed to schedule a meeting with McPherson & Jacobson, the firm that conducted the superintendent search, to establish performance objectives for Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger. This meeting is mandated by the superintendent search contract's two-year guarantee clause.  Finally, the board entered into executive session to review the performance of a public employee, extending the session twice before reconvening and adjourning the meeting.
