Action: D. Changes or Additions to the Agenda
Mr. Hill would like the final entry on the agenda, Executive Session, changed from "no action to follow" to "possible action to follow" in regard to a personnel issue.
Mr. Fuhr noted he would not be voting on this because he has no idea what the Executive Session is about.
The change was noted on this agenda.
Mr. Hill went on to state, "3 1/2 months ago he brought an anti-porn resolution to the Board. Beside being assured multiple times that it would be on the agenda, it never seems to make it. It was supposed to be on tonight's agenda, it is not again". Mr. Sabin noted it is integrated in the two policies that are on tonight's agenda. Mr. Hill stated, "this is not my resolution". Mr. Sabin stated he would talk about it when the policies are reached under New Business. Mr. Hill went on to state, "With it not being on the agenda, again, I can only assume it is the administration's stance that they just don't care to protect our kids from porn. I have been asking for 3 1/2 months to address this". Ms. Urias stated she had been told the attorney had been contacted concerning the anti-porn issue for policy vs resolution. Mr. Sabin noted it had been integrated in these two policies and procedures that are in the New Business section. Much of the verbage is in the procedure. Policies that the Board is responsible for approving are typically shorter and the procedures are more elaborate and detailed.
  Moved to approve the changes to Executive Session as stated in this document under .

  Action (Required Approvals): D. Approval of Required Approvals
Mr. Fuhr asked how the trips included in the Required Approvals are funded. Mr. O'Neil noted the funding sources are all external for these trips.
On the TRIO trip there were additional pages that should have been under the Personnel section of the agenda.
Ms. Jensen asked if the funds are coming from outside, what does that mean.
Mr. O'Neil noted the thrust of the current spending freeze is to stabilize our current asset position. The district does take advantage of external sources that fund many things, ASB, Booster, or specific categorical sources are not truly what we are concerned with. We have an assurance that those monies are available to pay for the trips. In some cases we would even lose the grant money if it isn't spent.
Mr. Fuhr asked a clarifying question to insure that no general fund dollars were being used on these trips. Mr. O'Neil confirmed that was true.
Moved to accept the required approvals with the additional pages (hiring documents erroneously attached) on the supporting document for the TRIO trip being removed.

  7. New Business
Action: A. Resolution 2024-05 Reduced Educational Program
Monty shared the resolution reviewed at the study session on Tuesday. He went on to read part of Resolution 2024-05.
The categories on Exhibit A are not listed in any particular order. The District is roughly looking for a reduction of $20,000,000.
Mr. Fuhr asked Heather Whittall, MLEA President, to approach the podium. He asked her what the cutoff time in the contract was to RIF teachers. Ms. Whittall answered there is a statute that allows provisional teachers to be non-renewed. If you want to go into the contract and activate the RIF, there are a few steps before we actually get to the noticing of teachers and that deadline is May 15.
Mr. Hill stated he would like to know what assurances of 1) that the Board of Directors will be actively involved in determination of who will be notified of expected layoff and 2) the Board of Directors, citizens, and voters within the MLSD boundaries will be actively included and involved of which programs unrelated to staff layoffs that will potentially be eliminated. He went on to say he has just been asked to approve this resolution. The Board says they have not been involved other than being told they were going to be approving this.
Mr. Fuhr noted if the resolution is not passed by May 15th, the teachers, per the contract, cannot be notified of RIF after the deadline. Ms. Whittall noted there is an RCW that allows for districts to non-renew provisional employees. That would be outside of this situation. Mr. Sabin noted the RIF may go beyond provisional employees which is why we need this action to be taken.
Ms. Urias stated she doesn't feel comfortable and asked for another meeting. Mr. Sabin noted there was a study session on May 7th with opportunities to ask questions. Ms. Urias stated again she was not comfortable.
Mr. Fuhr made a motion that we pass this resolution knowing that no decision has been made. It would be passed so we can look at what the district is looking to cut and make those decisions at a later time. If we don't have this passed by May 15th, a reduction in force (RIF) will no longer be an option when working with the budget.
Mr. Sabin noted the District will be doing work with each of the unions and in each of the departments. We will be developing a plan with the Board and will have future study sessions and will be open to the public. We have to make the first step by approving this broad, high level resolution to make the necessary adjustments to our budget for next year.
Mr. Fuhr asked if the same language was in the other union contracts. The classified don't have a May 15th deadline, but the principal's union does.
Ms. Breitenstein state she is not comfortable how we are moving forward at this point, but would like more transparency.
Ms. Jensen noted the May 15th is extremely important and is our legal obligation. Due to this being such a broad document, she stated she was not comfortable giving a blank check to cut. She noted she has not been involved in decision making or further discussion on what is going to be cut. Ms. Jensen noted more time is needed to discuss these very large decisions.
Mr. Sabin noted this would happen in the coming weeks. This is not a final budget, it would be discussed and reviewed with the Board. Nothing will happen without the Board's knowledge and consent. He stated again the work will be done with the unions and different departments to develop the plan. It is difficult to put all this work together in a few days with the May 15th deadline.
Ms. Jensen mentioned she is willing to give up her weekend to discuss the different budget items that need to be discussed at length. Ms. Jensen noted she feels she owes it to the community and that is what she is willing to do.
Ms. Jensen noted she has a motion on the table and then asked if there was a second. No second was given and the motion is dead.
Ms. Jensen proposed that the Board think about directing the Superintendent to gather his Cabinet in the next three to four days and we get together as a team and really put some hard numbers and time into this.
If the Board can move forward, after that, before May 15th, that would be good.
Mr. Fuhr noted he would be unavailable for the meetings.
  Moved to approve Resolution 2024-05 Reduced Educational Program.
  Motion by Kevin Fuhr, second none.  Motion died.
  Action, Presentation: B. Highly Capable Program Plan
Nick Bontrager presented the Highly Capable Plan.
Our 6-12 Highly Capable Committee came together to review what was being done with highly capable services and smooth transitions from the elementary.
You may ask why this plan should be approved. It ensures accountability for special student services and it is tied to a state grant.
The plan which allows us to operate, get approved, and apply for the grant.
Mr. Bontrager also explained the best way for the Board to view the plan.
This is being presented to receive approval for this Highly Capable Plan.
  Information: C. Policy 2020 - Course Design, Selection and Adoption of Instructional Materials
Mr. Sabin noted Policy 2020 and Policy 2121 are what he referenced when Mr. Hill noted he had an anti-porn resolution he wished to see on the agenda. This policy was run by [legal counsel who inserted the indicated language into these two policies. Procedures are reviewed by Cabinet after policies are approved by the Board.
Ms. Jensen asked what "age appropriate" actually means before we move forward. Ms. Mason noted she would look into a guideline of what "age appropriate" actually means.
It was requested by Mr. Fuhr to have the procedure attached to the policy when it is presented for the second reading.
  Information: D. Policy 2021 - Library Information and Technology Programs
Mr. Sabin noted Policy 2020 and Policy 2121 are what he referenced when Mr. Hill noted he had an anti-porn resolution he wished to see on the agenda. This policy was run by legal counsel who inserted the indicated language into these two policies. Procedures are reviewed by Cabinet while policies are approved by the Board.
Ms. Jensen asked what "age appropriate" actually means before moving forward with approving these policies. Ms. Mason noted she would look into a guideline of what "age appropriate" actually means.
It was requested by Mr. Fuhr to have the procedure attached to this policy at the next meeting for review.
  Action: E. Easement Request from JR Simplot
Mr. O'Neil noted representatives of JR Simplot contacted MLSD to purchase a small piece of easement ground (approximately 6'x250') Local brokers have been contacted to garner a fair market value for this small piece of land ($14,000).
  Moved to approve the selling of easement property to JR Simplot.
