before the next meeting and be prepared to present it to the rest of the board on July 13th.
The board can then address contract renewal.

in a public forum instead of an executive session as has been done previously.

completed all of their collaborative meetings.

for receiving both reports.

engagement, and for Board Directors to process the recommendation. Superintendent
VanderYacht was directed to identify possible dates in July for the full board to be able to receive
and discuss the recommendation.

changes to be made to the Board Director Handbook for the 23/24 school year. A decision was
