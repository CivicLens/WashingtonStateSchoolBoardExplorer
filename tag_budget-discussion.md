The special meeting held on August 19, 2024, focused primarily on budget discussions for the district, led by Ms. Lewis, who provided an overview of current financial conditions and funding sources, including allocations from the General Fund and other revenue streams. Kirryn Jensen raised inquiries regarding the transportation co-op involvement of surrounding districts and the potential for a secondary interfund loan, which Ms. Lewis indicated might be necessary in November due to low cash flow. The meeting also highlighted the importance of open communication and transparency in budget matters, a sentiment echoed by Jensen in her appreciation for the interim superintendent's efforts. Additionally, discussions included the management of the district's bank accounts, with a focus on the possibility of consolidating accounts for better financial oversight. The budget hearing was scheduled for August 22, where the board would vote on the budget, granting authority for spending during the school year.
