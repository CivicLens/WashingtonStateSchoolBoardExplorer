SUPERINTENDENT’S UPDATE

Dawn Tarzian provided an update regarding the district’s immunization exclusion date. All
students must be current on immunizations by October 15, 2012. Multiple letters have gone out to
families, and the schools continue to follow up with parents of students who do not have updated
records. This is the first year that the exclusion is being implemented, so a tremendous amount of
work has been done to become compliant. The whooping cough epidemic shows the importance
of making sure that our students have met the state requirements.
Terri Hutchins asked if immunizations are a hardship to the family then what is the District doing?
Dawn mentioned the free immunizations offered and discounts and that notices had been given to
the families about those options.

The district had 195 employees who made changes in their health insurance packages as a result of
a new provider offering. Dawn expressed her appreciation to the central office staff involved in
supporting our employees as they worked to understand the new options and make decisions. In
particular, she thanked Carol Baker, Human Resources Specialist.

INFORMATIONAL PRESENTATIONS

A. District Communication Plan
Les Brown, Jodi Thomas and Rene’ Carroll presented. Les spoke about input from district staff
and patrons. Jodi listed some new avenues they are pursuing this year for getting the word out
such as year news releases to media, Facebook, Twitter and a District communications calendar.
This fall the specific group they are focusing on is realtors. Realtors will be given flyers with
information about the Washougal schools that the realtors can hand out to their clients. Rene
shared the name they came up with for their communicator group: Partners for School (PS) and
how they would like to share their ideas with the community and get feedback from the
community. They have contacted about 140 groups and have sent them an invitation letter. It was
also mentioned that they want to be able to communicate with the community through a Google
account. A kick off event for the Partners for School will be held on Thursday, October 8th in the
WHS commons. Blue Note is also that night right after the kick off. Ron Dinius suggested also
publicizing school events in the River Talk publication. Rene’ also shared that work is being done
to have monitors placed in businesses and offices around town to share photos and school
messages and updates.

B. State Assessment Report
David Tudor presented spreadsheets and information on the new accountability system in
Washington. He mentioned how Pauline Rule and Rob Anderson have done a lot of work for the
positive state assessment outcome in science. Concern was expressed over low scores for 5th and
6th graders where a lot of transition is taking place and ways to maybe help with that transition
were discussed as focus needs to placed here. David informed the Board that the state would be
releasing a preview of AMO, Annual Measurable Objectives, tomorrow and going live for an
appeal process. On November 1, the State will be finalizing that data. It was also addressed that
the shifts in accountability system are that we had to agree to college and beyond readiness, and to
develop a different accountability and support system. The State now identifies school as:
priority, focus, emerging or reward. Priority schools are schools that are the lowest 5% or lowest
performing Title I schools, and they have a graduation rate of less than 60% and they have to be
receiving some type of grant. Jemtegaard Middle School (JMS) has been identified as an
emerging school. The State requires the district to send a letter to parents notifying the
community that JMS is an emerging school, and that JMS had to complete an action plan to
present to the State by September 14. Emerging school performance is based over 3 years trend.
Terrie Hutchins asked about the possibility of changing our grade level grouping to K-8. The
board discussed, deciding that the community would need to be involved in evaluating such a
change.
C. Debrief WSSDA Legislative Assembly Meeting
Ron Dinius discussed the different schools they visited and what ideas they are implementing in
those schools and that it is going to be a tough session for our legislators. At this meeting, Randy
Dorn spoke of priorities for schools being able to retain basic education funding, improve or
remove ineffective teachers, improve training for teachers, and reduce drop out rate. Dawn
Tarzian said that the Supreme Court has an obligation to fund education but the resources are not
there. Ron Dinius stated that May 15 will remain the annual date for contracts and notification.
Also that all legal notices to maybe done on the website. A concern he had was whether a board
member should be at all workshops.
