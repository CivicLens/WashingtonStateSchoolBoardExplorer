Re: 2024 Comprehensive Plan and Winslow Sub Area Update
_________________________________________________
The City of Bainbridge Island Planning and Community Development Department will provide a presentation and information
regarding the 2024 Bainbridge Island Comprehensive Plan and the Winslow Subarea Plan Periodic Updates to the School Board
of Directors and the BISD school community.
The City of Bainbridge Island released the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for public review on July 26, 2024, and
will accept comments through Thursday, October 10, 2024. The purpose of the DEIS is to thoroughly assess three distinct
alternatives to accommodate growth on Bainbridge Island over the next twenty years (2024 - 2044).
The City of Bainbridge Island would like to ensure the community is aware of the release of the DEIS and aims to inform the
community of the implications of each alternative/scenario. This presentation is information only.

Re: Interlocal Agreement for Woodward Middle School Solar Installation
_________________________________________________________
On January 4, 2024, The City of Bainbridge Island invited public agencies to submit applications to host a 120kW photovoltaic
solar array to be paid for and installed by the City and its consultants/contractors and then transferred to the public agency upon
completion. Once the application process had been completed, the City and its consultants identified five sites for evaluation
based on their potential to meet the Citys goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by sixty-four metric tons per year.
The five selected sites were evaluated based on the following criteria:
Usable Roof Space
Sufficient Load (power consumption)
Designed for Solar Ready (sufficient roof structure capacity)
Age of current roof structure and expected lifespan
Structural Impact
Electrical Modifications (fewer modifications)
The final report made by the Citys consultant, Design West Engineering, concluded that Woodward Middle School be selected
for the project based on the ratings it received for each criterion above.
I am requesting approval and authorization for the district administration to enter the attached interlocal agreement with the City
of Bainbridge Island for the design and installation of 120kW photovoltaic solar array at Woodward Middle School

RE: Policy 3205: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of Students Prohibited - First Reading
_______________________________________________________________________
I am submitting for your review the first reading of Essential Policy 3205: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of
Students Prohibited. This policy replaces current BISD Policy 3700: Prohibition Against Sexual Harassment. The text of Policy
3205 closely reflects WSSDA model policy with a few minor edits.
On April 19, 2024, the U.S. Department of Education released its Final Rule under Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972, the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving federal
financial assistance. As a result, Policy 3700 is now out of date, with Policy 3205 reflecting a complete revision of policy
language to align with the new Title IX Regulation (effective August 1, 2024).
Of note, the new Regulation is ...not retroactive, which means districts must still comply with the 2020 Regulation for any reports
of incidents that occurred prior to August 1, 2024. Thus, districts will need to maintain two different Title IX regulatory schemes,
side-by-side, in perpetuity, which will require skilled Title IX Compliance officers and additional resources to manage compliance
effectively (Policy and Legal News, August 2024).
Navigating the New Title IX Landscape: A Guide for Educators and Administrators - Page 3
Policy and Legal News August 2024.pdf
Additionally, all district employees must be trained on new Title IX guidance. To meet this requirement, all BISD employees will
watch OSPI Training Module 1: 2024 Title IX Final Rules in the first 60 days of the school year.

RE: Policy 3206: Pregnant and Parenting Students - First Reading
____________________________________________________
I am submitting for your review the first reading of Encouraged Policy 3206: Pregnant and Parenting Students. This is a new
BISD Policy. The language closely reflects WSSDA model policy with a few minor edits.
On April 19, 2024, the U.S. Department of Education released its Final Rule under Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972, the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving federal
financial assistance.
According to OSPI the new rules, ...include antidiscrimination requirements related to parental, family, and marital status, as well
as pregnancy and related conditions. Related to pregnant and parenting students, the rules require schools to provide
reasonable modifications to the schools policies, practices, and procedures as necessary to prevent sex discrimination and
ensure equal access to the schools education program or activity. Examples of reasonable modifications, as well as other
guidelines for supporting pregnant and parenting students, are outlined in the rules
Title IX changes.pdf
To meet the outlined regulations for K-12 schools, Policy 3206 and the accompanying procedure outline the rights of pregnant
and parenting students according to TItle IX.

I recommend the BISD School Board approve the first reading of Policy 3206: Pregnant and Parenting Students.

RE: Policy 5010: Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action

____________________________________________________

I am submitting for your review the first reading of Encouraged Policy 5010: Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action. The text of
Policy 5010 closely reflects WSSDA model policy (updated July 2023) with a few minor edits, serving as a complete replacement
of current BISD Policy (last revised November 12, 2015). Policy 5010 is referenced in the completely revised Policy 5011: Sex
Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of Staff Prohibited, thus necessitating policy review and revision of BISD Policy 5010.
Policy and Legal News (May 2018) outlined reason for WSSDA language change:
WSSDA revised this policy and procedure to update legal references and remove unrequired language regarding utilization
analysis. Second Substitute House Bill (SSHB) 1506 revised Washingtons Equal Pay Act, clarifying some of the definitions and
adding some more prohibitions. For example, the Equal Pay Act now clarifies that job titles alone are not determinative in
whether employees are similarly employed. Rather, employees are similarly employed if the performance of the job requires
similar skill, effort, and responsibility, and the jobs are performed under similar working conditions. Although the changes to the
Equal Pay Act did not affect the substance of the existing nondiscrimination policy, we added legal references to reflect SSHB
1506. Additionally, we noted language in the procedure that stated districts would conduct utilization analyses for groups for
which that requirement does not apply, so we removed that language.

I recommend the BISD School Board approve the first reading of Policy 5010: Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action.

Re: Policy 6113 Community Use of School Facilities Fee Schedule First Reading

Attached for your review is Policy 6113, Community Use of School Facilities Fee Schedule (last revised May 27, 2021)
incorporating fee updates for individual school spaces available for rental reservation and staff fees directly related to increases
in wages over the last five years.
Substantial research in the form of a comparison of local neighboring district practices and current fee schedules provided the
basis for this fee structure. The proposed fee schedule has been further refined by analysis of utility data and staffing levels
since the last revision of the overall fee schedule on February 14, 2019.
I recommend the board approve the proposed fee schedule for the first reading.
