COMMENTS – BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
Terrie Hutchins attended the Washougal High School (WHS) production of “Guys and Dolls” which
was really a good show. The choreography was excellent, many students were involved and the
production went smoothly. Se was glad to see that Excelsior High School (EHS) students
participated as well. Ron Dinius attended the Washington State School Directors’ Association
(WSSDA) annual conference in Bellevue last week. This year’s conference was the most
collaborative that he has ever seen. Many groups were represented and involved in some great
discussions and presentations of important information. Elaine Pfeifer seconded Terrie’s comments
about “Guys and Dolls”, noting that it was great to watch both the seasoned veteran performers as
well as the newer students performing. The sets and costumes were incredible. Elaine expressed her
appreciation for the opportunity for the board to hold some of their meetings at the schools. Blaine
Peterson added that it was a joy to watch the students perform in the WHS musical. He also thought
that the WSSDA conference was the best he has attended so far. Blaine recently attended a Quality
Schools Coalition meeting with Dawn Tarzian, where the group discussed the importance of having
superintendents and boards from southwest Washington put together a unified message to the state
legislature about what is important for schools. Winter sports have started, with the first games and
matches beginning next week. Blaine urged those present to attend athletic and music events at
schools in the district. The annual Trail Band concert will be held the Saturday after Thanksgiving.
This great concert benefits Washougal schools, and there are still tickets available.

SUPERINTENDENT’S UPDATE
Dawn Tarzian provided the board with a fall Community Education report, highlighting several very
popular courses and the addition of new classes. She congratulated students who have been selected
to participate in All-State performing groups: percussion All-State Wind Ensemble – Crystal
Saltmarsh; All-State Symphonic Choir – Luke Block, Cortney Gonzalez, Austin Smith-Brown, and
T. Walker Anderson. Dawn provided an update regarding the monitoring of the bond refunding
opportunities. She reported that the board made a wise decision in September to wait on the
decision, since interest rates have risen since then. Dawn enjoyed the WSSDA conference and
appreciated the opportunity to get to know the board member elect, Karen Rubino during the New
Board Member Boot Camp workshop.

COMMENTS – CITIZENS
Amanda Klackener asked if the “Stuff the Bus” food drive is a district-wide event, and if so, why
there is one school not participating. She stated that students are missing out on a great opportunity
to participate as a district-wide “team”, and does not like the message sent by having one school opt
out to support another cause. Dawn replied that she knows it has been a long-held tradition for Cape

Horn-Skye to support the charitable drive in its own smaller community. Amanda suggested that
there might be a better way for all schools to partner, and for Cape to be able to support Stuff the
Bus at the same time as its own drive. She would like to see this discussed further and sees it as an
opportunity to work to minimize the “upriver/downriver” divisiveness that sometime exists.
Michael Piekarski announced that he has accepted a position in another district. He will be
transferring by the end of 2011 to Mukilteo School District. He has enjoyed his tenure at Washougal
School District and will miss everyone here. Dawn Tarzian presented him with a gift, and she and
the board expressed their appreciation for Michael’s service to Washougal schools.
Mike Adams has run the Washougal Youth Basketball League for 8 years. The program has grown
a great deal in recent years. He thanked Kathy Douglas at Community Education for all of the work
she does to schedule gym use for the growing number of teams. This year, the program has 26
teams – about 300 kids in grades 1-6. He asked the district to continue to work with him to find
sufficient gym space and suggested some possible ways to accomplish this.

PRESENTATIONS
A. Introduction of the Turf Fundraising Committee
Rick Thomas, Chairman of the WHS Turf Campaign Committee, introduced the other committee
members present: Gordon Tostenbo, Mike Adams and Amanda Klackner. Rick also shared the
names of the remaining committee members: Gail and Brian Anderson, Gary Martschinske, Kyle
Eakins, and Roger Daniels. Rick spoke about the vision of this committee and the importance of its
work. The group plans to have the WHS turf field replaced during 2012. The committee asked for
board support, both in a public endorsement of the campaign as well as personal financial
commitments. The committee would also like to know from the board and district what specific
dollar amount the district will commit to toward the turf replacement. The board will sign a letter of
endorsement and be prepared to give the district’s pledged financial commitment to the project at the
next regular meeting. The board thanked the committee for the work they are doing.

B. Turf Field Budget Allocation
Rosann Lassman shared information regarding funds reserved from past years’ budgets totaling
$200,000. Dawn Tarzian shared that Doug Bright is working to secure updated bids from the
vendors who prepared estimates for turf replacement last year. Doug spoke about potential
partnerships with neighboring school districts and municipalities who are also installing new fields.
Mike Adams will meet with Doug to ensure that the turf committee is not duplicating the work being
done by district staff. The committee would also like to make recommendations to the board
regarding a possible model to reserve funds for future field replacements at some point. The board
will move forward at the next meeting with a decision about the district’s financial commitment to
the turf replacement project.

in schools. The board will bring this policy back to the next regular meeting for a second reading.

highlights the severity of the current financial recession. She shared the governor’s proposed budget
cuts, explaining some of the impacts each would have to schools. The board discussed the proposed
cuts and categorized each proposal as one the board could support, could consider, or could not
support. The board analyzed each proposal by looking at how that cut would impact students.
F. Debrief WSSDA Fall Conference
Ron Dinius spoke about some of the discussions he participated in at the WSSDA conference,
highlighting one in particular regarding unfunded mandates. Blaine Peterson reported that there was
a great workshop about ways to interact with your community, where many interesting ideas were
presented. Board members agreed that they came away from the conference thinking more about
collaboration, especially in terms of working together to get through the current difficult financial
times. Ron spoke about discussions related to stable funding for schools and staff evaluations, as
well as an academic acceleration program that has been successful in the Federal Way School
District. Karen Rubino and Dawn Tarzian expressed their appreciation for all that they learned in
the New Board Member Boot Camp session.
