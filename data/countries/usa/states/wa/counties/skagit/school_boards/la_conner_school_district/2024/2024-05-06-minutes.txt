  K. Appoint Interim Superintendent Effective July 1, 2024 (Susie) - Superintendent Will Nelson has resigned from his position effective June 30 to become a Professor at Western Washington University.
President Deyo thanked Will for his three years of service to our district. He implemented several educational programs designed to promote student achievement and the development of lifelong critical-thinking skills. We adopted new K-12 math curricula and began the transition to mastery-based learning while creating increased planning opportunities for staff. He was a big proponent of implementing PLC instruction that allows varied student learning styles.
  President Susie Deyo said the School Board had looked at other interim superintendent options and considered doing a search but found that external candidates would have brought a big financial cost to the district. Financially, it is better for the board to appoint an interim superintendent within the district as opposed to appointing an interim outside of the district or to conduct an external search for a superintendent for the 2024-2025 school year.
  David Cram currently serves as the Deputy Superintendent, Director of finance and operations, human resources and risk management; Director of operations and planning; and transportation supervisor. Directors praised his ability to quickly shift the district's finances out of the red and into the black. We had to implement painful personnel and program cutbacks ahead of the 2023-24 academic year as K-12 enrollment continues to decline which is how we’re funded. He has helped our district navigate a challenging budget due to a significant decline in student enrollment combined with the McCleary Act.
  Director Agen moved, and Director Quintasket seconded to appoint David Cram as our interim superintendent for the 2024-2025 school year effective July 1, 2024. Motion carried 5-0.
  President Deyo stated the district is pleased to have him lead our school district over the next year as interim superintendent along with academic support from Beth Clothier, Director of Teaching and Learning. She commented that between the two of you, the district has a great opportunity with this leadership arrangement that will save the district money.
  Director Agen stated La Conner is fortunate to have David Cram’s experience and knowledge of the community and he will be of great benefit to our district serving as an interim superintendent next year.
President Deyo announced David Cram will be formally sworn in as interim superintendent at the May 20th board meeting and invited his family to attend the board meeting.
  David Cram thanked the board for the positive comments and ongoing support.

Policy 5411 – Staff Vacations
  President Deyo asked the directors to review Policy 5411 – Staff Vacations. Although most district staff are covered under CBAs, this policy addresses exempt staff not covered under a CBA. To allow thirty days of accrual is a liability to the district. Corporate America has changed this process, it’s now use it or lose it each year. She recommends considering changing the wording, staff members either use it the year it’s earned or they lose their vacation days if they don’t take them within the same year accrued. Director Agen is in favor of lowering the 30-day accrual to 5-10 days which could be carried over one year.
  Deputy Superintendent of Finance, Human Resources and Operations Dave Cram stated our policy is similar to WSSDA and other districts. It’s common to allow staff covered under this policy to cash out so many days per year and carry over so many days. 
B. Second Reading – No policies under second reading.
