Recommended Action :

Public Content
SITUATION

Accept the Building Condition Assessment Report, as
presented.

Districts must complete Building Condition Assessments on any district building that has received School Construction Assistant
Program (SCAP) since December 31, 1993. Such buildings become part of the states Asset Preservation Program (APP). In
order to remain eligible for future SCAP funding, districts must fulfill the requirements of APP. Those requirements include
maintenance of the building to ensure a 30-year expected life and completion of an annual Building Condition Assessment (BCA)
to generate the required report and issue it to the school board. The requirements and details of the Building Condition
Assessment are described by Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OPSI) as follows:
The Building Condition Assessment (BCA) is a systematic rating of common building components and is
based on Uniformat coding and categories. The five major Assemblies are substructure, shell, interiors,
services, and furnishings. Under the five major Assemblies are Sub-assemblies and Components. The
BCA scoring consists of ratings at the component level with choices that include excellent, good, fair,
poor, and unsatisfactory. The individual component scores are combined to produce a total building
condition score based on a 100 point scale.
The above component ratings are entered into OSPIs Information and Condition of Schools database (ICOS) and computed into
a numeric score. The scores are then compiled into a single number per building and automatically generated in a report. The
attached ICOS report shows the score of buildings required under the states Asset Preservation Program.
RECOMMENDATION
The Board of Directors accepts the Building Condition Assessment Report.
