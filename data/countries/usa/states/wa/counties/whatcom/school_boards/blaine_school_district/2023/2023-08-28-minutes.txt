  2. Public Comment
A. Public Comment
The following individual addressed the board regarding a topic of concern:
Natalie Chavez shared her concern related to program cuts in Blaine schools. Ms. Chavez commented on increased budgets in other public entities, and provided a specific example of public health funds being designated for the establishment of school-based health clinics. Ms. Chavez also made the board aware of concerns about young athletes dying after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
  3. Public Hearing
A. Public Hearing on 2023-2024 Budget
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter explained that this additional public hearing is being offered in order to meet the statutory requirement to hold a hearing in the same meeting as the budget adoption. President Thomas opened the hearing and invited public comment. No members of the audience expressed a desire to comment.

President Thomas stated, for the record, that the district's finances are currently trending right where Amber Porter predicted, despite a claim made last spring that the district would end the 2022-2023 fiscal year with an $11M fund balance. He further commented that careful planning and responsible fiscal management has placed the district in its current position, with the ability to budget for $2M in excess of revenue again in 2023-2024 which will spread out the impact of budget cuts. President Thomas expressed confidence that the district's finances would continue to trend as predicted in 2023-2024. He referenced comments that were made in the spring, particularly by one individual, which were hurtful and caused a great deal of discord in the community.
  Director Gibson added comments about the district's solid financial planning and the fact that there have been no audits to support that individual's claim. It was very unfair that the emotions of the community were stirred up by unsupported claims.
  Director Leu spoke about the importance of having a common understanding, and he commented on how those claims against the district split the community. Director Leu expressed a desire for this time to be focused on new beginnings, and he hopes to be able to heal the divisions in the community.
  President Thomas pointed out that there had been a room filled with more than a hundred people in April, and now five people in the audience at this meeting.
  Director Creydt commented on the need for increased communication, and she appreciated the clear explanation that was provided in her meeting with Amber Porter.
  President Thomas agreed and expressed his appreciation for Director Creydt's efforts to seek out the answers to her questions. He asserted that it is each director's responsibility to seek out answers so that they come into the monthly meeting with a better understanding of the facts.

President Thomas closed the public hearing at 7:15pm.
  4. Reports
A. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of July. The fund balance was right at the $5M mark with one more month to report on cash and investments for 2022-2023. Ms. Porter expects the year's fund balance number will be finalized by October, after a significant amount of reporting work. To avoid confusion, she may leave the fund balance off of next month's report and still report on cash and investments. Ms. Porter commented on the difficulty of comparing to the past two years, and she hopes that 2022-2023 will provide a new baseline for comparisons moving forward.
  B. Bond and Levy Planning
The board was provided with a report on planning for the district's proposed bond and levy initiatives in the February 13, 2024 special election. Amber Porter started with providing basic information about the three types of school levies. The district's current operating levy is nearing the end of its four-year cycle, and Ms. Porter explained the limits on Blaine School District's ability to collect levy funding. Bond levies provide the district with funds up front, and allow the debt repayment to be spread out over a long period of time.

Ms. Porter outlined the district's plan to maintain current tax levels which makes the timing of a new bond initiative important. To preserve the current tax level as existing bonds step down, early 2024 will be the ideal time to request a new bond. The board must approve a bond initiative by resolution and the Whatcom County Elections Office must be notified no later than December 15 in order to place the bond initiative before voters on February 13, 2024. There will need to be good communication to the public in the months leading up to that election.

A Facility Task Force has been working for many months to review and evaluate current facility conditions in order to make a recommendation to the board. The Task Force goal was to identify priority projects, giving consideration to constraints, including enrollment and financial obstacles. Dr. Granger reviewed the Facility Task Force Report which included a recommendation of priority projects to be supported by the new bond. Short and long term priorities were identified by the Task Force. Dr. Granger affirmed the district's future intent to build an elementary school in Birch Bay. However, due to the current enrollment decline, the Task Force determined that upgrades to Blaine Middle School and other facilities on the current campus would be of benefit to all students.

Director Creydt questioned if the Task Force reviewed Birch Bay census data, and she expressed her belief that census data shows more students reside in Birch Bay. Dr. Granger indicated that a review by the district's Transportation Department confirmed that there is a relatively equal split of students between Birch Bay and Blaine.
  Director Leu expressed concern about a requirement for voter turnout, and Ms. Porter clarified the requirements for the bond levy to pass.

Ms. Porter informed the board that a maintenance and operations levy resolution would be presented for consideration at the September meeting. She reiterated the goal of maintaining the existing tax level, and added the dollar amount of the bond may be $56M. President Thomas asked for clarification about the bond and levy resolutions. He also asked if the $56M figure was determined based upon maintaining the tax level or based upon the cost of anticipated construction. Discussion continued regarding the process of determining the bond levy amount.

Director Leu expressed a desire to prioritize doing the middle school construction project right the first time so that it will last. He expressed a preference to consider quality over maintaining the tax level. He additionally stated the importance of investing in the district's technology infrastructure, and discussion continued.
  President Thomas expressed concern about rising inflation, and Director Creydt asked how the district would make up funding if a project went over budget. Discussion continued regarding how the district would address costs in excess of bond levy funding. Ms. Porter explained that a project would have to be modified to match the available funding, and examples were provided of how this was handled in past projects.

Ms. Porter encouraged the directors to reach out to Dr. Granger with additional questions, and to take advantage of an opportunity to tour the middle school facility.

The board will likely be asked to consider a bond resolution at next month's meeting, and President Thomas encouraged the directors to meet with Dr. Granger in the next month to discuss questions and concerns so that they can come to the meeting prepared to take action. President Thomas reiterated the importance of all directors doing their due diligence in the next month to educate themselves and have questions answered.
  C. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Dr. Granger expressed his appreciation to Amber Porter for her work on budget development. He pointed out that the 2022-2023 General Fund balance was on track to end where Ms. Porter had predicted it would at the April meeting.
He also expressed appreciation for the hard work of the leadership team as presented at the work session prior to this meeting.
The first 3 days with certificated staff on campus have gone well, and all staff returned today. Dr. Granger described his message to all staff about spreading positivity.
The first Supper with the Superintendent took place on August 21, and Dr. Granger is aiming to provide that opportunity on the third Monday of each month.
