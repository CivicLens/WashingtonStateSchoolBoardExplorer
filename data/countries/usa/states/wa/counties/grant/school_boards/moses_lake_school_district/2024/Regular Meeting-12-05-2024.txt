----- Written Comment(s) ----1. Mark Ward:*
<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->I beg of the board to be specific when advertising the levy.

Many in the public do not know what "extra-curricular" covers. Please be specific: sports, drama, music...? Please name what
you are talking about when you say "extra classes." Are you talking about Advanced Placement, Foreign Language, Science,
Math?
Finally, please be proactive and name the cuts that will be made if this levy doesn't pass. There are those that will vote no no
matter what they are told, but many on the fence need to hear concrete programs funded and concrete cuts that will be made.
Thank you for all of the work you are doing.
