Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

synthetic turf fields and related improvements at Bellingham

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director of Capital Projects and School Facilities

Explanation of Issue:
As part of the bond approved by voters on February 13, 2018, additional synthetic turf fields and related
improvements will be constructed at Bellingham and Squalicum High Schools. The work will include new
soccer, baseball and softball fields as well as an additional tennis court, restrooms, concession stand,
and lighting. (Similar work will be completed at Sehome High School as part of the current Sehome
project).
RCW 39.80.040 governs the process for selecting architects. One option is to select a firm from an
annual general request for statements of qualifications from firms interested in providing such services.
After reviewing the statements of qualifications from firms who responded to our annual request, I believe
DA Hogan and Associates is best qualified to provide services for the additional synthetic turf fields and
related improvements at Bellingham and Squalicum High Schools. They previously provided outstanding
service on our earlier turf field projects at Bellingham and Squalicum and are a leader in providing
architectural services for turf fields both in Washington and throughout the United States.
I am seeking your approval to begin contract negotiations with DA Hogan and Associates for services
related to additional synthetic turf fields and related improvements at Bellingham and Squalicum High
Schools.
