Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors approve the Sunbelt Staffing LLC
contract Agreement for the 2024-25 school year.

Public Content
Background:
Sunbelt Staffing LLC has been providing temporary District Healthcare and Special Services staff. Our district has had difficulty directly hiring
for these positions due to staffing shortages and the inability to find qualified candidates. The contracted staffing Sunbelt provides would
normally be district employees. We reached out to several contractors, and this vendor was able to meet our needs in a timely manner.
Lowest cost was not a factor in our decision because costs are comparable between staffing agencies. This contract is for special education
and health services district-wide staffing services for unfilled 2024-25 school year positions. The original contract was approved for $98,820
on 9/9/2024. Since then, these departments have needed additional staff. Therefore, the estimated costs will exceed the current contract
total by $90,180 for a total of $189,000 for the 2024-25 school year.
