Food ServicesMr. Bailey recommended that we go with Sodexo.
Mr. Dykstra wanted to do what is best for kids and was concerned with quality of food. He was
concerned with what would happen with current kitchen staff.
Mrs. Buswell expressed concerns with quality of food and noted she has made comments
repeatedly about not wanting food services to be a money maker or profitable. She noted this has
been an issue with Chartwell’s for several years. She noted historically we had no other bidders
except Chartwell's. Other districts have switched and level and quality has been better. She noted
the decision is not based on price it is what is good for kids. She was also concerned about
perception of the school board if they don't listen to the negative feedback regarding food.
Naomi Padgett felt the food was undercooked or overcooked and tasteless. She and several
friends do not eat hot lunch. She noted it is the quality of the food she dislikes.
Mr. Hutchinson reiterated that the pediatrician recommended his student not eat hot lunch and
when she stopped her stomach issues subsided. She missed a lot of school and that affects
learning.
Mr. Maier agreed with Mrs. Buswell’s comments.
Mr. Dykstra noted he appreciates Hossien and his responsiveness.
