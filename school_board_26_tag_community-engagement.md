## 2024-12-02 - PASCO_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Pasco School District's Board of Directors includes a structured approach to community engagement through the inclusion of student representatives. Each year, three students from grades 11 or 12 are selected to serve as Student Board Representatives, providing a direct liaison between the student body and the Board. This initiative emphasizes student autonomy and engagement, allowing representatives to convey student opinions and report back on board activities. The qualifications for selection include maintaining proper academic standing and personal behavior standards, ensuring that the representatives reflect the values and interests of their peers. The application process opens annually in June, demonstrating the district's commitment to fostering student involvement in governance.
