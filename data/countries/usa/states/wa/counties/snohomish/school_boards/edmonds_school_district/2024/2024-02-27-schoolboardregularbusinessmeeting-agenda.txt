Background:
On Saturday, January 13th, 2024, Edmonds staff discovered significant water damage/standing water at
Meadowdale Elementary School from fire suppression pipes that had frozen and then burst. The school
was closed on 01/16/24 and 01/26/24 to allow teachers and staff time to clean up and move out of their
classrooms, prepare for a temporary change to remote learning and then set up their classrooms in a
new temporary location. Currently, the goal is to return students to Meadowdale Elementary after spring
break.

Directors reviewed the document most recently at their Board Retreat earlier this month (2/1/2024).
Proposed changes can be seen on the attached redlined version of the document.

Public Comment Updates
Background:
During the February 1 Special Meeting - Board Retreat (open to the public), the board discussed
elimination of the second public comment period. Public entities do not normally have two periods of
public comments, our single comment period is in compliance with our board policy 1400 on Meeting
Conduct, Order of Business and Quorum. Though no additional public discussion is necessary at this
time, it is being brought forward in a regular board meeting for additional transparency. It is not necessary
for the board to vote on this item and the board will instead be reaching consensus on the elimination of
the second comment period as a standing agenda item.

Additionally, we will be considering changing the process to sign up for virtual public comments to align
with RCW 42.30.240 and posting those changes to our website. The process for submitting written
comments, which are attached to the board agenda, remains unchanged.
