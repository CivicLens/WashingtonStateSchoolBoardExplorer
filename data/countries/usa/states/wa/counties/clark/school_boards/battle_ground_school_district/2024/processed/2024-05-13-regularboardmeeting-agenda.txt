Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors approve the student travel
requests as presented.

Public Content
Background:
Per Policy 2320, student travel requests require board approval if they are overnight trips. Advisors are required to submit all
required paperwork at least two weeks in advance to Cheri Dailey, Director of Business Operationsand Risk Management.
Advisors must clear the trip with their building principal prior to submitting the request to Risk Management. Advisors are
required to submit itineraries, budget information, transportation information and learning objectives along with the dates of travel
and information on the group of students traveling with chaperones.

Exceptions to the rule are travel requests for state and national tournaments and competitions. The procedures for these types of
trips is outlined in Procedure 2320P. Often the tournaments come up quickly and there is not enough time to present the trip to
the board prior to the trip. In this case, advisors must submit all paperwork to the Risk Management Officer prior to the trip for
approval. The trip is then ratified by board members at their next regularly scheduled board meeting.
Student travel requests are attached.

Grading and Progress Reports

Public Content
Presenter:
Travis Drake
Director of Instructional Leadership
Background:
As a system, we need to be able to have data that allows us to determine whether or not a student is being successful in order to
develop effective interventions. Our current grading policy for secondary is too broad, making it difficult to utilize grades in this
manner. The revision of 2420 does the following:

1. Connect the grade to the essential standards;
2. Develop a sense of consistency in our grading practices, specifically between like classes;
3. Specify the frequency in which we communicate our grades;
4. Specify grades 9-12th.
The WSSDA recommended policy (which was our previous board policy) is too general and doesnt allow us to develop an
intentional approach district-wide. Many surrounding districts use the WSSDA policy as a baseline, and then they create more
specific parameters. Weve learned that the districts that are too specific are unable to implement these practices.

Recommended Action :

The Board approve the bidding of the Central
Operations Building Project

Public Content
Presenter:

Kevin Jolma
Executive Director of Facilities and Operations
Background:
This project will construct a new 23,125-square-foot Maintenance Facility as well as expand the existing Warehouse space by 50
percent. The Maintenance Department is currently located in a 1932 converted Bus
Barn that is well past its usefullife. In addition, the Warehouse is at capacity with the growth the District has experienced.
The new site will move our Operations from the BGHS parking lot on Main Street to the site of the old Central building that was
demolished in 2012. This is next to our existing Warehouse.
The District routinely utilizes our Small Works bidding process (which does not require advertising) for projects less than
$350,000. This project is estimated to be approximately $7.7 Million and therefore needs to
be publicly advertised and bid.
RCW 28A.335.190 requires the district to advertise for furniture, supplies, equipment, building, improvements or repairs, or other
work or purchases, except books whenever the estimated cost is in excess of
$75,000. The advertisement must bepublished in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the district, once each
week for two consecutive weeks.
After the project bids, the Board will then need to approve the award of contract. The project is in our Capital Facilities Plan and
is funded by Impact Fees.

The Board approve the bidding of the Central Operations Building Project

Presenter:
David Kennedy
Executive Director of School Improvement

The Board of Directors approve the submittal of the
180-Day Waiver.

Background:
The waiver days during the 2023-24 school year have propelled staff skills in the collaboration process to improve student
learning. There were at least three standards completed by teams. Time to continue with more standards is needed.
This proposal replaces two previously calendared late start Wednesdays and continues to provide more time than is required for
instructional minutes in RCW 28A.150.220(2).
These waiver days will continue to provide classified staff an opportunity for professional development within their workday
without additional cost to the district. For some of our classified employees, this training is mandatory to their job responsibilities,
yet no options currently exist to provide time within the calendar to meet these requirements.
To apply for this waiver, Battle Ground Public Schools is required to submit a proposal to the Office of Superintendent of Public
Instruction (OSPI). Our focus on October 30 and January 29 will be to continue unpacking essential standards, planning
instruction, and aligning curricular resources, saving late start Wednesdays for data analysis and planning for interventions and
enhancement. The waiver days will provide collaborative teams time to work interdependently to achieve common goals linked to
the purpose of learning for all.

reports to the board would continue yet alignment would be directly tied to school improvement plans, the strategic plan, and the
