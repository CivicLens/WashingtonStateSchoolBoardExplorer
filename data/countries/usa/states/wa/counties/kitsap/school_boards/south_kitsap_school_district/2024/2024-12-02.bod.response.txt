Inslee, we honor the dedicated school board members at South Kitsap School District. Their commitment embodies the principles of the SK Way, prioritizing respect, trust, and strong relationships within our community. A heartfelt thank you to Jeff Wilson, Brian Pickard, Kate Espy, Megan Higgins, and Jay Villars! Their work is a testament to their dedication to high-quality public education and the well-being of our youth. School board members often face complex decisions and sift through extensive information, all while developing a future-focused vision for the district. These elected community members oversee an annual district budget of $175 million, with more than 9,100 students, and 1,500 employees. Their collaborative efforts with the school district staff are a shining example of the SK Way in action. They serve as a crucial link between the local community and the school district, helping to realize our collective aspirations for all students.
