AGENDA ITEM:
Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Kent-Meridian High School Employee International Travel Authorization to Vancouver, BC
AGENDA ITEM:
Kent-Meridian International Baccalaureate (IB) Program staff, Kim Roberts, travel June 20-23, 2024, to
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to take part in the Association of IB World Schools Workshop.
Kent-Meridian High School is starting a new class next school year called IB Environmental Systems and
Society. International Baccalaureate (IB) requires our teacher to have training to instruct the class, and
there are two upcoming training courses this Spring (Pittsburgh) and Summer (Vancouver, B.C.). The
Vancouver, B.C., training location is optimal because it takes place after the school year ends, does not
require guest teacher coverage or loss of learning time for students, and has significantly reduced travel
costs due to shorter travel and no guest teacher coverage.
Policy 6213 Travel Authorization and Expense Reimbursement: The board recognizes that it may be
necessary and beneficial for board members, staff, students, and agents of the district to travel outside of
the Kent School District in carrying out district-related operations.
Procedure 6213P Travel Authorization & Expense Reimbursement: International travel requires the
completion of the Employee Travel Authorization form and must be approved (regardless of the funding
sources) by immediate supervisor, department/division head, superintendent, and board. International
travel must be approved in advance of departure.
BOARD GOALS:

Goal 1: Preparing Students to be Global Citizens
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
Travel costs are covered by the Kent-Meridian High School International Baccalaureate budget.
RECOMMENDATION:
That the board of directors approves this item.
