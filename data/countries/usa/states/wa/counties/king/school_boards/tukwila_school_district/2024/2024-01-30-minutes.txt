General Apportionment and Special Purpose - shows specific funding we receive from the state
State General Apportionment Staffing examples 
State General Apportionment Staffing MSOC example 
Federal revenue - all grants received had significant red tape.  ESSER funding is ending, which creates a financial cliff for school districts.  
ESSER Funds - received approximately $18M and have approximately $6M left.  With funds ending, this will significantly impact students, staff, programs, and curriculum. 
22-23 Expenditures - 75% of our budget is staff salaries and benefits and 25% is MSOCs.  
Revenue vs. Expenditures - Starting in 21-22, the district spent $2.2M more than it received. Director Larson shared that he believed the Board did not get transparent information in a timely manner. 
Ending Fund Balance - The district spent $3.0M more than it received last year, which reduced the ending fund balance by $3.0M.  A negative ending fund balance automatically triggers binding conditions. Director Simpson asked, if we are running at negative $1.5M, what is our projection for 23-24?  Mr. Woodard shared that information will be presented either by the end of February or March.  
Binding conditions - What it is and what it isn't. 
Reduction in Force - key dates/timeline
Bargaining implications- working with all bargaining units within the same timeframe
  The Board of Directors requested the following items before the February 13th Work Session:  
Bargaining - what is the ask from the union, current contracts, what are the expectations?   
Program Summary - list of programs that are and are not working, costs, etc.
