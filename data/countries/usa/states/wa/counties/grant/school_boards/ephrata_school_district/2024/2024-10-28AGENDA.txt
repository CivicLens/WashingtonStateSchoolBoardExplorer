d. Out of State Travel for ACTE Conference in San Antonio, TX
CTE would like to take a team of staff to the Association of Career and Technical Education National C onference in San Antonio, Texas.
(December 4-7). This team would include the Business & Marketing instructors from the middle school and high school as well as other
administrative staff. Every year, a different program is a focus based on Program Approval by OSPI and this year it is Business &
Marketing. This conference will be paid for by CTE funds with a majority being covered by CTE grants including the Perkins grant. This
type of professional development helps recruit and retain high-quality CTE educators and improve program quality. Recruitment,
Retention and Training of CTE Educators is an Element of the Federal Perkins V Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment (CLNA). The
Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment (CLNA) is a tool that helps local education agencies (LEAs) and states make data-driven
decisions about Career and Technical Education (CTE). Total cost of the conference including hotel, flight, registration and meals is
estimated around $15,000-$20,000.

e. Approve 2024 CTE Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment (CLNA)
This May, Sarah Vasquez and Scott Sandberg revisited the CLNA to present to various stakeholders in Grant County. The CLNA is a
requirement of the Perkins Grant. The purpose of a Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment (CLNA) is to evaluate how well a school or
district's career and technical education (CTE) programs align with local workforce demands and student needs. It identifies gaps in
program offerings, resources, and equity to ensure that all students, including those from underrepresented groups, have access to
high-quality education that prepares them for career success. The CLNA also helps guide decisions on funding, program improvements,
and collaboration with local industries to better serve the communityâ€™s economic and employment goals. Through the CLNA, strategies
of improvement were identified including expanding student opportunities through field trips, workshops, and industry collaboration,
enhancing staff professional development (National Conference), and increasing articulation agreements and certification opportunities.
Efforts also emphasize improving equity, program growth, and culturally responsive teaching.
