Excellence. The award for Overall Excellence is based on each school’s Achievement Index, a
state-wide measure of school performance that includes student achievement in reading, writing,
mathematics and science. This index considers how schools are improving over time, how they
compare to schools of similar demographics, and their progress toward closing achievement
gaps. Kulshan Middle School and Alderwood Elementary School were each awarded the 2011
Washington Achievement Award for Overall Excellence. Kulshan Middle School Principal
Jeannie Hayden shared the award with the School Board and explained the steps Kulshan has
taken over the last few years to support each student’s different learning styles. In addition,
Kulshan has also teamed with Western Washington University to provide tutors for Kulshan
students. Ms. Hayden recognized the Kulshan staff and thanked them for their hard work and
dedication. The Alderwood Elementary School staff was recognized at the February 23 School
Board meeting.
Superintendent Greg Baker also reported that staff continues to work on the budget for 2012–13.
He has presented budget information to labor groups, Parent Advisory Committee, Student
Advisory Committee as well as having three different opportunities for all staff to attend a
presentation about the budget and give feedback. A video of the budget presentation was also
posted to the district website. Dr. Baker will summarize the feedback for the Board.
Dr. Baker reported that work on the Bellingham Promise continues. Feedback that has been
received will be incorporated into the document. The final version will be included in the May
issue of Inside Schools.

Boston, Massachusetts with Superintendent Greg Baker. She shared information on their visit to
several Boston school sites and conference workshops she attended.
Audience
Tom Kunesh addressed the Board in support of music education and expressed concern that the
reduction of election options at the middle school level has reduced student participation in
music programs at the middle and high school levels. He feels because middle school students no
longer have as many options to explore languages, art, and music these classes will have reduced
enrollment causing them to be cancelled. He encouraged the district to show leadership and
allow more opportunities for students to take music and other electives.
