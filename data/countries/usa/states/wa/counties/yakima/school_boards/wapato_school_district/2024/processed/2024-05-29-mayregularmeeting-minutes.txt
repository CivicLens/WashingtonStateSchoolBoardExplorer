that classroom. Emotional support also made available to staff.

Graduations are taking place next week and asked the Board about passing out diplomas. The board
engaged in discussion and the consensus was that all will attend the ceremonies and all will rotate
handing out diplomas at each graduation.
Construction Update: Kevin Hill, Executive Director, reported he has visited with many constriction and
architect companies over the past 10 days and has received good interest and is very optimistic about

calculated the match funding available for PACE and explained the issue in detail. He informed the
Board, with the new correction in the calculation by OSPI, the District will now receive $0.00 of match
funding for this project. He explained how this information impacts the DForms process. The District will
need to utilize solely bond funding to construct PACE HS. He said by next spring the District will be
eligible for some match funding for the Elementary build. He explained the process in detail and
detailed a timeline of steps, events, and funding. He noted the zero-match funding for the PACE project
does not impact the taxpayer and it does not change the order the District will expense the funds. He

today and was a part of the 1st bond sale. He talked about his experience in that process. He reported
the next bond sale will be in December 2025. Mr. Hill said the next steps in the construction process is
to request for qualifications beginning next week and then request for proposals. The plan is to being
