  3. Presentations
  A. Equity and Empathy
  Dr. Pedroza kicked off the presentation with a quick review of the Equity and Empathy strategic plan goals.  
  Goal:  Staff will know students by name, strength, culture, and need, which will ultimately contribute to a sense of belonging.
  Percentage of positive scores on EES - EES (EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS SURVEY) STUDENT BELONGING AND IDENTITY - For 2023 - 24, our goal is to improve from 67% in Spring 2023 to 72% in Spring 2024  
  Mr. Baker shared the Educational Effectiveness Survey (ESS) will be given to students in grades 4 - 12 in April 2024.  Director Simpson commented he would like to see a copy of the survey.  In addition, can the final data be disaggregated by grade level and ethnicity?  Mr. Baker confirmed that the data would show grade level and ethnicity.  
  Director Simpson asked how teachers know they are reaching their goals on student belonging.  Mr. Baker shared this would be done through feedback from the building administrator, via formal and informal observations.  Additionally, strategies are shared and practiced with all building staff.  
  President Hoover shared that they are looking for evidence of how students feel about their belonging.  Currently, we have PreK - 3rd grade and we currently do not measure their feelings on belonging. They asked that K-3 grades be included in the survey.  They requested they would like to see a couple of questions that could be included as a reference point  They also asked if we have a shared definition of culture. Dr. Pedroza shared that we are working on shared definitions in several areas, including culture.  
  Goal: Students will have access to high-quality classes that will expose them to a variety of potential careers.
  Participation in AP, Honors, and Highly Capable classes and Future Educator Program ALIGNED REPRESENTATION IN AP, HONORS, HIGHLY CAPABLE CLASSES AND FUTURE EDUCATOR PROGRAM
  We will align the representation of students receiving Special Education (SE) services with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), multilingual learners (MLs), and those experiencing homelessness in Advanced Placement (AP), Honors, Highly Capable (High Cap) services, and the Future Educator Program (FEP) to align with the representation of these students within Tukwila Schools. In 2023- 2024 a baseline will be established along with benchmarks for future growth.
  President Hoover requested data on how many students have participated in the Future Educator Program and have gone on to teaching.  This is the first year of the program.  We will be able to provide a report for the 24-25.  
  Director Simpson asked how are we ensuring access?  Dr. Deno shared that we are participants in WASA's Inclusionary Practice Program.  We as a system need to shift from exclusionary practices to more of Universal Learning experiences so all students can access content/instruction.  Access points will look different for a variety of reasons.  If we rely only on intervention, we won't get to where we have more representation in a variety of programs. 
  President Hoover asked if we have data on students who qualify for Highly Capable and choose not to participate.  Dr. Deno shared that once a student qualifies, they are in the Honors/AP classes unless a parent or student chooses to opt-out.   
  President Hoover commented that if we are trying to get everyone in, what does that mean for core instruction? We want students to perform at their best, which doesn't necessarily mean AP classes.  Are we creating the pathways to be accessible?  We don't want to glorify that AP is the only pathway.  Dr. Pedroza shared that a lot of students think they can't when they really can.  We want to offer a variety of options.  We need to define rigor in our classrooms.  How do we define it?  What does that look like?  Director Larson commented on how can we design classrooms in inclusive ways.  
  At Foster HS, 150 students low-income/MLL students will be receiving City of Tukwila provided laptops to better be able to do learning activities at home. An example is for students to be able to work on their High School and Beyond Plans, and completing Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Director Larson commented that he hopes the data shows that this is working out the way it is intended to and the growth measures are realistic. 
    Goal: Staff will actively work towards transforming TSD into an anti-racist organization.
  One hundred percent (100%) of staff participate in equity and anti-racist professional learning (including the Anti-Racist Summit) for 2023 - 2024. 
  By the Spring of 2024, there will be an updated policy and procedures for Board approval.  
  The District will review the priorities and plan staffing levels and budget to support the work internally over the next three (3) years. Monthly team meetings will be held to unpack what does it mean to be an anti-racist organization.  The summit will be held annually with mandatory attendance for all staff. 
  President Hoover commented on budget sustainability to support the future of this work.  Dr. Pedroza shared that she has met with the University of Washington regarding a grant that could move this work to Tukwila.  We don't know what this looks like yet about budget sustainability to support the future of this work, specifically around the organization of systemic changes for equity work.
  Goal: Multilingual students will acquire additional skills to be successful in mainstream classes.
  WIDA scores PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS EXITING MLL PROGRAM
  100% of MLL students who qualify for English Language Development services will meet the criteria set forth on the Washington State English language proficiency assessment within 5 years of their initial qualification.
  Based on the 2023 WIDA assessment, 50% of students who exited had been receiving services for 5 or fewer years. We will continue professional development for teachers about incorporating language and content in general education instruction and reviewing literacy instruction practices for multilingual learners with the district MTSS team.
  Fiscal impacts
  Reflects expenditures that Tukwila is already receiving from grants including Title I (etc etc), not any added expenses.
Tech Levy: CEE Surveys $ 24,999.31 (3 Year Contract)
State Transitional Bilingual Instructional Program (TBIP): $1.5M
Title IIA (federal funds for professional development): $245,732
Title IIIA (federal funds to support language development): $319,178
  What is at risk?

All outside contracts paid with ESSER funds will sunset in August 2024. Examples are BELONG Partners and Puget Sound Educational Service District anti-racism professional development.
  B. Highly Capable Program
  Dr. Deno shared a presentation on the Highly Capable Program.  
  Highly Capable Review Team has: 
  To Date:
Revised identification procedures
Surveyed staff about the Highly Capable Program
  In Process:
Developing Highly Capable professional learning based on survey results
Developing protocols for school-based identification teams to utilize in the spring
  Next Steps:
Identify recommendations for modifications to the Cluster Grouping Model at the Elementary Level
    Highly Capable Identification Procedures
Annual Cognitive & Academic Assessment of all K-4 Students
Use of Local Norms
School Based Teams Review Multiple Data Points for Identification
  Currently, data shows that the trends are slightly up but remain relatively constant.  We have made changes in the program, i.e. screening all students, changes in assessment, etc.  However, we haven't seen the changes we hoped to see with the disparities despite the changes that were made.  We need to review and look at adding additional changes to our process.
