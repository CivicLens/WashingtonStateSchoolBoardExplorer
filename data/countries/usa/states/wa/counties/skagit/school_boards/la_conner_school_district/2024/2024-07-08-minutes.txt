Director Agen asked, what is the plan to grow 10 points in math and reading. Superintendent Dave Cram said he’ll defer the specifics of this question to Director of Teaching and Learning Beth Clothier. He stated that we would use the IReady test scores from this year's fall, winter, and spring assessments.
  Superintendent Dave Cram stated that he intends to host focus group meetings and meet with all our local non-profit organizations to present information on the upcoming levy. He’ll prepare and present an annual state of the district.
  Director Quintasket moved, and Director Agen seconded to approve the 2024-2025 Superintendent Goals as presented. Motion carried 4-0.
  D. 2024-2025 Board Goals – President Deyo presented the 2024-2025 Board Goals based on the discussion during the June 24 board retreat. We referenced our strategic plan – Engage/Connect/Achieve. We’ll review Policy 3245 and enforce the cell phone policy that no phones will be allowed during school hours. Messages can be left in the main offices to be passed along to their students. Cell phones are too much of a distraction and take away from the teachers to teach and the students to learn. We’ll evaluate Superintendent Cram in November and February.
  Director Agen moved, and Director Quintasket seconded to approve the 2024-2025 Board Goals as presented. Motion carried 4-0.
  E. 2024-2025 Superintendent Cram Contract - President Deyo explained, our attorney drafted that the proposed addendum to David Cram’s 2024-2025 contract. It’s an addendum to his annual contract that includes the additional roles and responsibility to serve as superintendent until June 30, 2025, with an additional $12,000 per year compensation.
  Director Agen thanked Mr. Cram for the increased leadership roles and workload that he has taken on. His work ethic far exceeds the amount of compensation he will receive.

Director Pedroza moved, and Director Quintasket seconded to approve the 2024-2025 Superintendent Contract for David Cram as presented. Motion carried 4-0.

3. Closing Items:
A. Announcements - President Deyo reported that on July 10, 2024, there will be a lunch meeting at La Conner Seafood Prime Rib with Swinomish Tribal Chairman Steve Edwards, Board Director/Senate Vice Chair Alana Quintasket, Director of Teaching and Learning Beth Clothier, and Interim Superintendent Dave Cram to provide updates on the district and the tribe.
On July 16, 2024, the board directors will attend the Swinomish Tribal Senate Meeting at 9:00 AM on Moorage Way.
Director Quintasket mentioned that she attended a summer school makeup class and was disappointed with the provided lunches, stating that the bread and cheese were soggy and the lunch lacked nutrition. This is unacceptable.
Superintendent Cram clarified that the lunches provided to the summer programs are prepared by the program staff, not the food services department. He acknowledged the need for nutritious and edible lunches and assured that he would address these concerns with the appropriate staff tomorrow.
