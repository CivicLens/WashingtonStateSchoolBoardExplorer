The Tahoma School Board is comprised of five elected members who each live within a respective region of the Tahoma School District boundary. The board is responsible for: Setting the district vision and strategic goals Adopting and monitoring the district operating budget Reviewing, revising and adopting district policies Hiring and evaluating the district superintendent Individual school board directors do not hold the power to make any decisions for the district. Only as a quorum (a majority) can the board vote to make decisions that are within the responsibilities of the board and compliant with local, state and federal laws. The superintendent is the the school board's only employee. The school board approves all hires, however, the school board does not supervise, evaluate or direct the work of any other district personnel. Contact the School Board Attend a School Board Meeting School Board Assignments Contact the School Board The school board values and encourages your engagement and partnership, and you are invited to contact the board via email. You are welcome to email individual directors, though we encourage emailing the entire board at schoolboard@tahomasd.us for board-specific topics. This ensures that all board directors and the superintendent receive your message at the same time. By board policy, the school board president is the designated spokesperson for the board and may respond on behalf of the other directors. If your inquiry is within the superintendent/staff's responsibilities, the superintendent or a designee may respond to your message. Please be aware that written communications sent to the board and its directors are potentially subject to public disclosure, in whole or in part, pursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, RCW 42.56. EMail the school board You are invited to deliver public comment at any regular school board meeting and special meeting where public comment is on the agenda. Individuals who would like to make Public Comment may do so at the meeting by signing in on the 'Public Comment Sign-In' sheet. Guidelines outlined below must be followed: Each person will be given three (3) minutes to comment and a maximum of 20 minutes per any one topic will be allowed. Speakers whose comments are less than three (3) minutes in length may not defer their remaining time to others. If there are multiple speakers on one topic, speakers may be limited to points of view not yet expressed. Any person wishing his/her comments retained as part of the permanent record may submit a prepared statement to the board secretary prior to the oral presentation. The President may interrupt or terminate an individual s statement when it is too lengthy, personally directed, abusive, obscene or irrelevant. Comments/concerns relative to district personnel will not be heard in public; rather, they should be directed through the Complaints Concerning School Personnel or Programs Policy 4220. Formal presentations must be scheduled with the Superintendent, in writing, no later than Tuesday, noon, one week preceding the regular meeting. Attend a School Board Meeting The School Board meets each second and fourth Tuesday of every month of the school year, unless otherwise posted and with the exception of July, August, September, November and December. Most school board meetings are held at Tahoma School District Central Services (25720 Maple Valley-Black Diamond Rd SE, Maple Valley, WA, 98038), and the location of every meeting is published in the agenda notice. Meetings are open to the public to attend in person. Meetings are also live streamed, recorded, and archived on the district website. A full calendar of upcoming school board meetings is available online. All meeting agendas, minutes, policies and procedures can be found online in Board Docs . School Board Assignments At the beginning of each calendar, the school board assigns each director to serve as a liaison to certain schools, departments, strategic goals, community organizations, and other initiatives as needed. Board directors do not hold authority over any of their assignments, but they serve as a representative of the board and are expected to bring appropriate information back to their fellow directors that can inform the work of the board.
