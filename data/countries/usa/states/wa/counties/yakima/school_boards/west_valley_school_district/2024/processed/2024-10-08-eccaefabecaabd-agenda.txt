West Valley School District #208 creates a space where every student is valued, safe, and empowered to achieve
academic excellence in an innovative culture of learning.

Members of the public who would like to provide public comment will sign-in.
Speakers will be called in the order that they signed-in to speak. Speakers will be given three minutes for their
comments. Public comment is not the proper forum to address concerns about a specific staff member. If a person
has concerns about a specific staff member, they should make an appointment with the Superintendent to address
their concerns.
