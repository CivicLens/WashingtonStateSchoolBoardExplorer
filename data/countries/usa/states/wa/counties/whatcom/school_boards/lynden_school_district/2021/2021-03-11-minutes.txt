Thank you to our education support professionals during Classified School Employee week of March 8-12,
2021. The staff serving in health services, technology, custodial, grounds, maintenance, paraeducation,
transportation, child nutrition, office professionals, and substitutes all play an important role in the
educational success of our students.
Washington State School Retirees are recognized March 15 - 21, 2021 with a Proclamation signed by
Governor Inslee. Thank you to the school retirees that continue to remain active in schools.
The LHS culinary class is taking lemons and making lemonade… or rather taking school lunch and making
an inspiring and equitable activity.
Problem: Given distancing, kitchen space, and the health safety challenges of having students work with
food at school, our culinary arts class has needed to push a lot of the “cooking labs” to be done at home.
Solution: Introduce the “Chef’s Challenge;” the newest show on the Food Network. Each chef (student)
received a bag of groceries (school lunch distribution bags) and they are challenged to make a culinary
sensation with the ingredients in the bag. Re-purpose a hamburger bun to become a crust, or an apple
oatmeal bar to become a strudel.
Mia's recipe is available!
The following athletes signed to play at the next level: Riley Anderson - Fastpitch at Lewis & Clark College;
