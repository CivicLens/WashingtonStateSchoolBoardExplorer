3. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
Information: 3.01 Discuss Corporate Donations/Facilities Naming Administrative
Policy
The board consider the creation and adoption of a new administrative policy to
express guidance related to the District's acceptance of corporate donations and
the way(s) such donations might influence the naming of district facilities.
Dr. Quinn presented a draft policy for the board's review and feedback. Also, she
said the Bond Oversight Committee is very interested in such a policy. They
believe there is potential in soliciting sponsorships for the new Ferndale High
School.
Discussion followed that included comments of—
•this is separate from naming a school
•memorials and donations would fall under this policy
•procedures would be written to implement the policy
•would there be minimum limit to donations received under this policy
•an ethics clause may need to be included
•would the district have a committee to review potential donations
Dr. Quinn will make edits to the draft policy and send it out to the board. The
draft will also be presented to BOC at its January 21 meeting. Edits will include:
taking out the naming of facilities, strengthening the goals statement, removing
reference to illegal drugs and ethics clause.
4. FOCUS ON STUDENTS
Information: 4.01 Report on Treaty Day Observance
The board received an update on the district's plans for observance of Treaty Day
on January 22, 2020.
Dr. Quinn reminded the board that on May 30, 2013, the school board adopted
instructional materials for grades 4, 5, 7, 10, 11 titled "Since Time Immemorial:
Tribal Sovereignty in Washington State," published by the Office of the
Superintendent of Public Instruction. At the same meeting, the board adopted
Resolution 7-2013 Tribal History and Culture Project, endorsing the support for
teaching the Since Time Immemorial curriculum and collaborating with the
Lummi Tribal Council. And, the school board adopted Administrative Policy No.
2001 Diversity and Multicultural Education (policy later renumbered to 2133).
Since that time, the district has been working to implement the curriculum. This
is an effort we share with the Lummi Nation. One of our biggest strides forward
was the decision to include and honor Treat Day. Lessons have been developed
for all K-12 students.

School Board Special Meeting January 14, 2020
Mr. Brittain said he has been working with Vista Middle School Principal
Heather Leighton and Lummi Nation members Jay Julius and Darrell Hillaire in
developing a video about Treaty Day. The video was viewed by the board.
Editing of the video will be completed and then it will be shared publicly.
Ms. Deardorff told the story of her mom being in a boarding school from age 5 to
13. She said Lummi Nation members were forced to go to Ferndale and were
treated badly. Ms. Deardorff said that inspired her to get a job at Mountain View
Elementary School as a paraeducator. She then returned to school where she
obtained her Master's Degree. She came back to Ferndale and served as the
Indian Education Director. She said she focused on making sure students never
felt left out. She said she's glad she is now on the school board and able to be part
of this transition.
5. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
Information: 5.01 Reviewed Responses to Recent Safety Situations
Dr. Quinn reported to the board that the superintendents in Whatcom County
and Whatcom County Sheriff's Office have been talking about policy and
procedures for access and restrictions of registered offenders in schools. She said
there are 540 registered sex offenders in Whatcom County—70 of those are at a
level 2 or 3. One of the things districts balance is when a sex offender may also be
a parent of child in a school. The parent still has the right, under certain
conditions, to access their child's school.
Dr. Quinn proposed policy for the board to consider. It is based on the work of
the superintendent's group. She recommended adoption of the policy. This
matter will be considered at the board's January 28, 2020 meeting.
Referring to what Ms. Fickeisen's commented on earlier in the meeting, Ms. Cool
asked about the protocols for teachers telling police about situations involving
students. Dr. Douglas said teachers are mandatory reporters to Child Protective
Services and law enforcement officials. Mr. Fairbairn added that the district
provides training for staff annually in this area. Ms. Cool commented about
providing some education on ERPO to staff.
Dr. Erickson suggested that the matter be delegated to the superintendent.
Dr. Quinn said she would call Ms. Fickeisen to follow-up. She, Mr. Fairbairn and
Dr. Douglas will also meet to discuss this matter.
Ms. Riddle noted that this should be part of the board's annual monitoring under
its policy on safety.

Information: 6.01 Discuss Equity Governance Policy
Due to time constraints, the board decided to place this item on the next study
session of the board.
Dr. Douglas did report about the inclusionary practices grant provided by
WASA and OSPI. He said there are three meetings scheduled for this spring. It is
preferred that one board member be on the district's team. Both Lee Anne Riddle
and Jessie Deardorff expressed interest in being involved in this work.
