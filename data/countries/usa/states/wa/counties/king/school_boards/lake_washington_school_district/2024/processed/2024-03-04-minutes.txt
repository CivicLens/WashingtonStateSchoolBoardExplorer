  G. Superintendent Report
1. Superintendent Report
Dr. Holmen presented an update on LWSD’s Legislative Advocacy for Public Schools. The Board developed a legislative platform with staff about legislation that could have the most impact to our schools. The district participates in Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA’s) legislative advocacy process. We work to establish and maintain relationships with our legislative delegation and meet with each member before, during and after the session. We also testify in-person, virtually and in writing on issues of concern/impact.
This year, our proposal was to adopt legislation that allows school districts to front fund capital construction levies using Limited General Obligation (LGO) Bonds. Senators Lisa Wellman and Manka Dhingra sponsored SB 5659 and Representative Lisa Callan sponsored HB 2411. While OSPI supported the bill, the Fiscal Note they provided caused some differences of opinion. OSPI did update their Fiscal Note, but the initial note create questions that we believe led to the bill stalling. SB 5659 died in the Senate Ways and Means Committee. HB 2411 passed out of the house. The Senate Education Committee decided not to hear HB 2411, and the bill did not move forward.
Dr. Holmen also shared some of the lessons learned from this process so we can bring this bill back next year.
  H. Public and Community Affairs
1. Update on Public and Community Affairs
Dr. Holmen provided a brief legislative update. The legislative session is scheduled to end this Thursday. Both budgets showed a per-student increase in Materials, Supplies and Operation Costs (MSOC). A much more detailed update will be provided at the March 25 Board Meeting. Director Guthrie shared that the WSSDA position window is opening later this week. Specifically, there was an item around sustainability that may need some modifications. That would need to be voted on by the full Board, so Director Guthrie will bring it back on March 25. Director Laliberte suggested that we suggest some specific, targeted language around LGOs.
  I. Closing Items
1.School Visits
President Choi shared information about the February visits to Kamiakin Middle School and Redmond Elementary. Director Yocum, Director Stuart and President Choi all visited. Future school visits are currently being scheduled.
  2. Committee Updates
Director Yocum and Director Guthrie attended the joint student/staff strategic planning committee. The groups are developing draft student and staff profile documents. Director Laliberte shared information about the Facility Advisory Committee’s latest meeting at Alcott Elementary. This committee shared an interest in providing additional capacity at Redmond High School and Eastlake High School as soon as possible. They also discussed the idea of potentially rebuilding Alcott on Site 44 (Cadman property) instead of at its current location. Last Thursday, there was a parent meeting at Alcott to discuss this option as well. Dr. Holmen shared a brief update on this meeting. The goal was to discuss the option of moving Alcott and to ask staff and families what the considerations need to be before a decision is made.
