FINAL BUDGET STATUS REPORT
FISCAL YEAR
2023 – 2024
Reported by Caryn Metsker, Executive Director of Financial Services

GENERAL FUND
REVENUES
• The District received a total of $103.3 million in revenue this year, which is $3.1 million more than last year. Here’s
where the funding came from:
• Local Sources ($13.5 million): Includes property tax revenue from the EP&O Levy, fees from food services, and
preschool tuition. Local revenue is tracked in a special fund, as required by the state.
• State General Purpose ($57 million): This is our largest funding source and includes Basic Education, CTE and
ALE funding, and Local Effort Assistance (LEA), which is state funding to match districts with EP&O levies.
• State Special Purpose Funding ($19.1 million): Supports specific programs like Special Education, LAP Bilingual
Education, Food Service, Transportation, and Highly Capable programs.
• Federal Funding ($13 million): This includes reimbursement for supplemental programs such as Title, Migrant
Education, and Special Education. Temporary funds from ESSER (CARES Act) are also included here.
• Other Sources ($485,000): Revenue from local government sources, educational service districts, or surplus sales.
This category also includes a required accounting entry for leasing agreements with Ricoh for printers and copiers,
where the revenue and expenses offset each other.

Our overall budget is supported by a combination of local, state, and federal funds, which allows us to run
essential programs throughout the District. However, revenue will decrease in the coming years, as federal
COVID funds will no longer be available. Districts will now transition to operating under 'normal' conditions,
although full funding from the state is still not in place.

GENERAL FUND
EXPENDITURES (continued):
Local Program Spending ($14.4 million): These funds include our levy $12 million,
plus additional local funding from grants, donations, tuition and more.
• Personnel Expenses: $8.9 million for staff not fully funded by the state, such as
teachers, support staff, paraeducators and long-term substitutes, as well as additional
benefits like stipends, extra time, cashouts, professional development.
• Local Programs: $1.8 million for programs like K-6 Art, STEM, Music, and Spanish.
• Preschool: $454,000 to cover preschool costs beyond available funds.
• Extra-Curricular Activities: $2.3 million.
• Safety and Security: $415,000.
• Strategic Plan Initiatives: $562,000.
• Other Reserves and Improvements: Funding for curriculum, maintenance,
technology upgrades, and other operational transfers.
• Transferred $1.2 million dollars to the Capital Project Fund to cover the interest for
the final non-voted debt payment, as well as additional funds to cover the cost of
pre-approved capital projects.
Materials, Supplies and Operating Costs (MSOCS):
• The state provided $8.8 million for these basic operational needs, but our actual costs
were nearly $17.2 million. This gap is why funding from local levies, grants, and other
sources is essential to keep our schools running smoothly.
• While some costs are planned, additional essential expenses often come up during
the school year. To cover these, we sometimes need to rely on our reserve funds or
other sources.
• Bond Initiative Costs: In the 2023-2024 school year, the district held two bond
elections, aiming to secure funds for critical projects. Although we came close, we
didn’t reach the required 60% voter approval. As a result, we incurred some
unplanned costs, including $260,000 for election expenses and $92,000 for bond
planning and educational specifications.
• Running Start Costs: Although we budgeted for Running Start costs, enrollment was
higher than expected, and the legislature increased the per-student funding amount,
which pushed us over budget. Additionally, Washington State recently passed a bill
allowing students to participate in Running Start during the summer, which further
impacted costs. We paid $1,647,000 to Wenatchee Valley College (WVC) for Running
Start student enrollment for the 2023-2024 school year, while our original budget was
set at $1.3 million.
• As costs continue to rise, we are committed to carefully assessing our needs across
the district to ensure we remain within budget while continuing to provide the essential
services that support our mission.

Most of the school district's budget goes
toward paying employees' salaries,
benefits, and leave. Some highlights
include:
•Substitute Staffing: We spent about $1.6
million on substitutes for teachers and
$600,000 for other staff.
•Professional Development: We invested
$1.57 million in training for staff. Of this, the
state reimbursed $630,000, while local
funds covered the rest.
•Salaries: Teacher salaries were nearly $1
million over projections, while support staff
salaries exceeded projections by $430,000.
These increases are due to a growing need
for paid leave and substitutes, as well as
additional staffing requirements mandated
by the state. Although these needs were
beyond our control, we have the legal
authority to address some of them.

Activity codes in school districts are labels or numbers assigned to different types of work or functions. They help the
district track how money is spent in specific areas, like teaching, counseling, administration, or maintenance.
Each activity code represents a particular kind of work, making it easier to organize the budget and see where
resources are going. By using these codes, districts can manage and report their finances more accurately, ensuring
funds are used appropriately and in line with state and federal requirements.

This chart shows program-specific revenues and expenditures across various funding categories.
We apply an indirect rate to all grants, typically using the federal rate because it is the lowest, allowing us more
flexibility with our funds. For federal grants, we only receive reimbursement for the expenses we incur, meaning
these grants show neither a gain nor a loss. Most federal grants allow a 10-15% carryover, which we use to keep
funding consistent from year to year. This carryover isn’t shown on our books, as the funds remain at the state
level until we request them.
State funds work a bit differently: we’re allocated a set amount, which is distributed monthly throughout the year.
We must meet a minimum spending threshold; otherwise, our program is considered in "recovery," and we would
need to repay funds the following year. If we spend above the minimum, we can choose to carry over the extra
funds, which is then tracked in our Fund Balance.

The ending fund balance is at $11 million, as expected for the year. There are some expenses that are in fund
balance, that were paid in 2023-2024, but will be moved to 2024-2025.
We ended up exceeding our appropriated expenditures, and this was not caught in time to implement a budget
extension. We will send a letter to OSPI to explain, as the ESD notes that this situation is common. One factor
was a present value adjustment that was not a true expenditure, and another was that the payroll encumbrances
missed a few contracts, causing payroll costs to be higher than expected once we finalized. We’ve since
collaborated with payroll to ensure these contracts are accounted for in the future and established a
reconciliation process to prevent similar issues.
Additionally, some programs spent more than budgeted, but sufficient revenue was received to cover these extra
costs. Moving forward, we’ll monitor these programs more closely to keep spending aligned with the budget. If
needed, we’ll implement a budget extension before year-end to prevent exceeding our allocated budget.

C APITAL PROJECTS FUND
Summary: This year, the Capital Projects Fund collected its final tax installment from a six-year levy, which
was used to help make a $4.6 million debt payment. Going forward, no more tax revenue will be collected for
this fund, with total taxes for the year coming in just under $2.5 million.
Additionally, $1.2 million was transferred from the General Fund to help finish some approved projects. With
this, we were able to complete the EJHS gym floor repairs, the preschool playground, intercom system
upgrades in several schools, and an upgrade to the EHS track.

DEBT SERVICE FUND

• Summary: This year, the District collected $1.8 million in taxes from a voter-approved bond from 2009. We
set aside $1.5 million, along with $1 million in interest, to save up for a large bond payment due in December
2026. Additionally, we made our final payment of $4.6 million on another bond (part of the capital levy) in
December 2023. The fund balance now stands at $18.9 million, giving us strong reserves to cover future
debt payments through 2030.

ASB FUND
• Summary: The ASB fund grew by $59,000 this year. Although both revenue and spending were lower

than planned, the schools still earned more than they spent, giving them a bit of extra money. When
planning their budgets, ASB groups include a cushion to cover any unexpected costs or additional revenue
that might come up during the year. There’s a lot of student activity happening across all schools, and
everyone is working hard to strengthen school climate and culture.

TRANSPORTATION VEHICLE FUND
• Summary: The transportation vehicle fund grew by $290,628 this year. This increase happened mainly
because we received more revenue than expected, thanks to an insurance payment for a bus that was
totaled and higher-than-expected funds from vehicle depreciation.

• Although we still experienced supply shortages and longer wait times for building new buses, the District
managed to acquire two new buses and two used buses this year. With continued higher depreciation over
the next two years, we expect the fund balance to keep growing. This growth will help us maintain our fleet
and aim to buy one or two new buses each year to keep our vehicles in good condition.
