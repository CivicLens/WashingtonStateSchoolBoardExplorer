a. Dual Language Program: Kirsten, Andrea, Melissa, and Karina presented. Utilizing a PowerPoint,
they took turns explaining the Dual Language program, starting with the mission, and the Why: To
provide a learning opportunity that meets the needs of all our multilingual learners. They detailed the
Three Pillars: Bilingualism/Biliteracy, Academic Achievement, and Sociocultural Competence. We have
a couple of language acquisition models to choose from: either grade level percentage progression, TK &
Kinder at 80%-20% to 6th-8th grade 50%-50% or 50:50 at all grade levels with pros & cons to each. This
was the first year in the implementation timeline with a core group doing book studies and attending

conferences to gain knowledge and to network with other districts that have the program in place. Next
steps include forming an advisory committee of which 50% must be parents of bilingual students,
creating our model (with board approval by the end of 2024-2025 SY), and determining how best to meet
our bilingual students’ needs. After that will be family outreach and to establish staffing to ensure we
have the capacity to provide the program. Four teachers so far are working to acquire their bilingual
endorsement: Melissa Larson, Lucy Pérez, Margarita Gonzalez, and Karina Ponce. The end goal is
implementation in 2026-2027, starting with TK and Kindergarten, followed by K-8 and finally a K-12
program.
Kirsten shared about the district offering the Seal of Biliteracy to students in grades 8-12. The student
must be truly biliterate in both English and the target language, as determined by passing a four-domain
test. Forty-three students took and passed the test during May intersession, 12 seniors passed all four test
areas (domains) earning the seal, which is recorded on their diploma, and they got to wear a special cord
at graduation, 25 juniors passed, and six 9th & 10th graders also passed. Students that take the tests earn
one credit for every domain they pass. Colleges recognize the seal, and the student does not have to take
foreign language at college.
b. Resolution #8-23 Adoption of the Budget for 2024-2025: Francis reminded the Board that by state
law we must adopt a 4-year budget. The appropriation amounts for 2024-2025: GF $20.7M, CP $2.1M,
Transportation $429K, Debt Service $693K, and ASB $201.9K. He explained the MSOC Disclosure: the
district must report any proposed use of the difference between allocation and expenditures and how this
use will improve student achievement. Cindy moved to adopt Resolution #8-23 Adoption of the Budget
for 2024-2025, Carlos 2nd; motion passed.
c. Resolution #9-23 Authorizing Appointment of Investment Officers: This is an annually required
resolution. Mark and Francis are the Auditing and Investing Officers and they plus the board members are
the signers for the Notice of Warrant Issue and Void Warrant Agreement for the 2024-2025 SY. There
were no questions, so Carlos moved and Cindy 2nd to approve Resolution #9-23 Authorizing Appointment
of Investment Officers; motion passed.

g. Resolution #13-23 Transfer of Funds-GF to DSF-May 2025
Francis: Part of the budget process is to repay the money we borrowed to pay for capital projects from the
Capital Projects levy. Payment is made in December and June; therefore the money must be moved in
November and May. Lupita moved, with 2nd by Carlos to adopt Resolutions #10-23, #11-23, #12-23, and
#13-23 as presented; motion carried.
