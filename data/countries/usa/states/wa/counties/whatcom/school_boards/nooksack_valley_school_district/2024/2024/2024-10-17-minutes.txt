HIGH SCHOOL PRESENTATION-SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT AND STUDENT SAFETY
Collin Buckley and Jeff Demorest gave an extensive report on the high school improvement plan for
the year, and efforts to support student safety.
Highlights from the school improvement process:
• The high school team has spent 2 years digging into perception data and interviews of
students around their perceptions of agency, status and belonging and set goals to improve
each.
• Students want choice in their learning, they want to feel belonging, and they want solid peer
to peer relationships.
• The high school teams have set goals and are working together in inquiry groups to improve
their practice and improve student experience.
Highlights from the student safety presentation:
• Q&A ensued about progress monitoring, the subjectivity of the data, and next steps.
• School safety has been a concern with recent incidents relating to vaping and drug use,
predominantly in bathrooms, as well as physical violence. Jeff Demorest provided the board
with school expectations, processes, and data to paint a picture of the current reality and the
challenges. He shared the next steps related to student engagement and parent support.
• Hannah Ordos commented on viewing 3 of the 5 fights and raised questions about the
feasibility of a resources officer, thoughts about garnering more parental volunteers during
lunch, and mentioned propensity of drug use. She also talked about the large number of
freshmen who could be interested in a mentor, like those provided by Be the One.

SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT
Superintendent Galley gave a short presentation on the following topics:
• A draft plan for policy maintenance, which was well received and will be on the agenda for
action next month. There was clarification on the executive team and who works through
procedures.
• The 2015 bond has a call date in 2025, and DA Davidson is recommending exercising the
call date that could save over 9% ($1.8 million). The board gave verbal approval to continue
with the process.
• The new bus barn is complete. Superintendent Galley gave a reminder the bus barn was
funded through direct appropriation from the legislature in 2023.
• The district received an $813,000 grant from RCO for the high school stadium field
upgrade. There are a few steps to take prior to acceptance.
• OSPI underfunded Transitional Kindergarten, which may be passed along to districts. The
hope is that the legislature will pass a supplemental funding bill this session. More to come
on that. Steve Jones commented on this being further reason to maintain a minimum 8%
fund balance.
