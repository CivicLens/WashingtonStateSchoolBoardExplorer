OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
November 9, 2022 – Options High School, 2015 Franklin St., Bellingham, WA.
Call to Order/Land Acknowledgment:
Ms. Bashaw called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. She acknowledged that this meeting
is being held on the ancestral homelands of the Coast Salish people.
Roll Call:
Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw (President), Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler,
Jenn Mason, Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
• Jeremy Kiniry is the parent of three students attending Carl Cozier Elementary,
Kulshan Middle School and Options High School. In the collective 19 years that his
children have attended the Bellingham Public Schools, they have experienced two
lockdown situations, both being within one week at Carl Cozier. There are great
things going on inside the walls of Carl Cozier, but there are serious safety concerns
outside of the building including public nudity, open drug use and crime. He is
appreciative that the school district and the Whatcom Transit Authority are willing to
take measures to mitigate the concerns but is disappointed that the City of Bellingham
is not. He would like to see someone take on the role of a liaison between the entities.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Congratulations to the school board for receiving the Board of Distinction award from
WSSDA. The board will be recognized during WSSDA’s annual conference next
week in Spokane, WA.
• Tonight’s consent agenda includes a report on EL-5, Communication and Counsel to
the Board. The report contains evidence of the various ways that the board
participates with our school community.
• 17 members of the Dual Language Program Planning Task Force attended the La
Cosecha conference last week in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The conference is
considered the premiere conference for dual language programs. The task force will
soon begin its second year of meetings.
• Two publications will be going out soon, the Fall 2022 Inside Schools and the 202223 Priorities for Progress.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Mason enjoyed hearing at yesterday’s Options High School visit how they
approach things differently than most schools. She is impressed with the work at
Options and appreciates that the staff is dedicated to the students and the school
community, often needing to help students work through challenging circumstances.
The school-based health clinic will be a help to many students. As a Carl Cozier
3

5.2

parent, she appreciated the recent communications and the district’s work to move
quickly toward some concrete resolutions of safety concerns.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler was disappointed when she watched the Oct. 26 City Club meeting
regarding the Prop 5 – Children’s Initiative. She knows there will be many families
who will appreciate the health clinic at Options.
• Mr. Benjamin agreed that the City Club meeting was not a good replacement for the
planned linkage meeting. He has asked Dr. Baker and Ms. Bashaw to discuss
rescheduling the board’s childcare linkage. He attended two WSSDA board meetings
in the past month, one being a planning meeting for the equity caucus at the
upcoming WSSDA conference. The Options High School visit had a casual
conversational feeling, which was good, but he missed hearing from students. He is
happy to know that we are close to seeing the opening of the school-based health
clinic at Options.
• Ms. Rose has some wonders about the school-based health clinic, but believes it is the
right thing to do. She shared that while meeting with an ADHD coaching group
recently it was agreed that the conscious effort of the district to see all students and let
them learn how they learn best would have been an impactful experience for the
adults in her group. She is proud to be part of a district that is changing that
experience for neuro-divergent people.
• Ms. Bashaw agreed that the school-based health clinic is the right thing to do for
students and families. The visit to Options was great, but she agreed that it is
challenging because high school students don’t start school until 8:30 a.m. She also
agreed that it was disappointing that the recent children’s initiative appears to not
have been approved by the voters. The group who worked on it are very dedicated to
the well-being of all children in the community.
