  2. Public Hearing
A. Public Hearing on 2023-2024 Budget
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided an overview of the proposed draft budget for the 2023-2024 fiscal year, including preliminary revenue, expenditure, and enrollment projections. The expectation for maintaining a 6% ending fund balance remains intact. Ms. Porter's presentation addressed specific questions and topics of concern that were provided by the directors in advance of this meeting.

Ms. Porter does not anticipate major changes to the draft budget provided on July 10, however minor revisions are ongoing. Expenditure adjustments may also be made as needed and in response to relevant feedback.

The 2023-2024 budget for each fund was reviewed, showing each fund's beginning balance, projected revenue and expenditures, and projected ending fund balance. Ms. Porter also provided explanation for each fund. Director Creydt asked for clarification regarding interest payments from the Debt Service Fund. Ms. Porter described the process for selling bonds to a lending institution and then repaying that debt over time. Discussion continued regarding projected Capital Projects expenditures for the coming year, including the purchase of property in Birch Bay and potential major repair projects on the Blaine campus. Ms. Porter does not expect to spend the full amount budgeted for Capital Projects, but capacity is there if needed. The General Fund's ending balance is budgeted at slightly higher than the required 6%. There was discussion regarding General Fund expenditures which include everything not covered by another fund. The district's salary expense makes up approximately 85% of the General Fund's expenditures.

Ms. Porter provided the required MSOC disclosure. No explanation was needed because the budgeted expenditures are higher than the budgeted revenue.

As required by RCW 28A.505.040, Ms. Porter reviewed the district's 4-Year Forecast disclosure. Ms. Porter explained that the purpose of this forecast is for planning, and it shows where the district's finances would end up if no changes were made to existing expenditures and revenue. In reality, however, the forecasted deficits are not allowed by law and the intent of the forecast is to show the need for making adjustments as needed in advance. Ms. Porter pointed out that the forecast assumes the replacement operating levy will be approved by voters in February 2024. She used a conservative inflation rate of 2% for the forecast.

Enrollment trends were reviewed, and Ms. Porter explained the method used for estimating budget enrollment. The estimated kindergarten enrollment is based upon the current kindergarten level. President Thomas asked about the status of next year's kindergarten enrollment, and discussion followed.
  A member of the audience asked if it would be too late after the start of the school year for the district to ask voters for more levy funds. Ms. Porter provided an explanation about levy funding which is considered by voters for increments of four years at a time. Discussion continued regarding the impact of McCleary which limits the district's ability to collect the full amount of levy revenue approved by voters. Ms. Porter further explained that, because of McCleary, Blaine schools now receive less of the local levy funds collected even though tax payers are paying more because the state is now redistributing those funds to districts throughout Washington.
  Director Creydt asked what the district's ending fund balance would be at the end of 2024-2025 and beyond if the levy passes in February 2024. Ms. Porter referred her to the estimate provided on the 4-Year Forecast.
  The Transition to Kindergarten program was reviewed, and Ms. Porter explained changes to how it will be funded by the state.
  Additional comments were provided on the appearance of $1.5M of revenue and expenditures in the General Fund resulting from new accounting requirements related to lease and software expenses. Ms. Porter explained that these expenditure and revenue figures cancel each other out and are not representative of actual money coming in or going out. Discussion followed to clear up confusion about this matter.

Ms. Porter pointed out the change in expenditures for school meals. Under a new state program, no-cost meals will be provided to all students in Blaine Primary and Blaine Elementary schools. Families are still encouraged to complete Free and Reduced Meal applications which provide support for other programs.

There was discussion regarding the budget reduction's impact on School Improvement Plans. Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger assured the board that quality curriculum, planning time, and experienced staff will be in place for the new school year. Any need for enhanced support will be determined on a school-specific basis and will be evaluated further in the coming weeks. Dr. Granger explained that campus administrators have been asked to determine their building's priorities as they work to identify areas where students need additional support. Each school will look different based upon the needs of its students. Dr. Granger reminded the board that School Improvement Plans will be reviewed in more detail at the work session on August 28.

Ms. Porter distributed a handout showing reduction impacts reported by the administrators of each school and department. Ms. Porter also distributed a questionnaire requesting feedback from the meeting participants. She indicated that completed questionnaires could be returned to her at the District Office or by email.

While meeting participants reviewed the handout and questionnaire, individual conversations ensued. Ms. Porter also answered questions from individual members of the audience.
  The board will take action on approval of the budget at the regular meeting on August 28, 2023.
