Functions of the Board Although members of the School Board are elected locally, they are state officers responsible for governing a political subdivision of the state. The Board operates independently of city and county governments but cooperates with them. The Board is a policy making body and, within the framework of state law, exercises complete control over the educational and financial affairs of the school district. Among its numerous duties, the Board adopts an annual budget and approves all expenditures; employs personnel; approves curriculum textbooks and courses of study; and makes decisions on school sites, building plans and construction contracts. School Board members have no power to act individually in the name of the Board. Action can be taken only when the Board is meeting in formal session with a majority of its members present. Under this sound principle, each member can reserve judgment on each matter until he/she has had an opportunity to hear the recommendations of the superintendent and to discuss it with other Board members. The Board recognizes that it has an obligation to the people of the Liberty School District to plan the best possible program of education and to expend revenues wisely. The Board also recognizes it has a unique function to interpret the schools to the community and the community to the schools.
