Meeting :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent of Finance
Explanation of Issue:
Resolution 27-20certifies the districts levy collections for calendar year 2021to Whatcom County. This adjusts the local levy to the levy
authority as authorized by voters.Under law, the board of directors is required to certify the levy amount to the assessor by November 30.
At the February 11, 2020, election, the voters of Bellingham passed a General Fund Educational Support and Operations Excess Levy in the
amount of $31,000,000 for collection in calendar year 2021. Recent changes in the laws regarding imposition of local tax levies and use of
local revenues have limited the amount of money that may be collected by school districts in the form of local levies for general operational
purposes.
During the budget process, we estimated the levy collection for 2021at $30,193,319. Using the state's revisedformula, the district is eligible
to receive$2,500 per pupil, adjusted for inflation. The district is allowed to certify up to the amount authorized by voters, which may be
adjusted to the amount calculated under state law by the county before collection.

Explanation of Issue:

The City of Bellingham is rehabilitating the Whatcom Creek sewer trunk main. The existing main was
installed in 1909. The goal of the project is to extend the life of the sewer main by re-lining the interior. Relining this type of structure will require custom shaping of the liner. The largest challenge will be to insure
the sewer main is operating at capacity during the re-lining process. The sewer main services a large
section of the city and cannot be taken off-line. Part of this work is scheduled to occur on our
Transportation property. The attached easement provides access to facilitate this work through the end of
2021. All construction efforts will be coordinated to not disrupt bussing operations and vehicle
maintenance.
