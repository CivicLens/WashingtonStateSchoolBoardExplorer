The board also welcomed newly elected directors Andy Song, Meghin Margel, and Donald Cook, with Superintendent Vela administering the Oath of Office. During the meeting, the board reorganized its leadership, electing Meghin Margel as President, Awale Farah as Vice President, and Tim Clark as Legislative Representative. The reorganization aligns with Board Policy 1210, which mandates the election of officers annually in December.
