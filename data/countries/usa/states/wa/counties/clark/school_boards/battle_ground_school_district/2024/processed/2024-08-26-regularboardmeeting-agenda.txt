Background:
Battle Ground Public Schools received funds from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) through the

school educators, community members, and district-level personnel.

Funding for this curriculum is through the 2023 AWARE Grant.
Social, emotional, and behavioral well-being can be supported by helping students acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes,
and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and
maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions. These programs are designed to create a supportive learning environment
that promotes students' academic success, emotional well-being, and social development. In the 22-23 school year, Battle Ground Public
Schools adopted a K-8 curriculum to support the social and emotional skills of students in those grades.
