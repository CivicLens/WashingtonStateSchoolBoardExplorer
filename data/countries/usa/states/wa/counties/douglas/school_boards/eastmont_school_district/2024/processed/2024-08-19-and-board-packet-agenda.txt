BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATION
In accordance with Board Policy No. 3520 Student Fees, Fines, and Charges, the
District provides an educational program for our students that is as free of fees charged
to our patrons as is possible. Fees that are charged are reviewed each year to ensure
prices charged are reasonable and are in line with estimated program expenditures.
The Administration is recommending no fee increases for the 2024-2025 school year.
We have made changes to the fee schedule to accommodate the requirements of
HB 1660 Legislation, which requires the District to waive optional extra-curricular fees
for eligible students. A student is eligible for a fee waiver if they qualify for free or
reduced price meals and have their parent/guardian provide a consent to share their
meal status information for that purpose.

‭BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATION‬
‭ chool districts are required to submit a four-year budget plan (F195F) as part of the annual budget to‬
S
‭the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. The plan consists of the current year budget‬
‭(2024-2025) plus three future years (2025-2026, 2026-2027 and 2027-2028) and is attached for your‬
‭review.‬
‭Assumptions used in each fund to project the next three years are as follows:‬
‭·‬

‭·‬
‭·‬

‭·‬

‭·‬

‭General Fund‬
o‬‭Enrollment Projection –Assumed a decrease over‬‭the next few years with kindergarten‬
‭
‭enrollment being lower than anticipated from live birth data.‬
o‬‭Revenues – assumed a decrease with enrollment‬‭projection lower. Federal revenue‬
‭
‭declined due to expiration of COVID-19 Funds.‬
o‬‭Expenditures – Assumed slight increase for non-employee‬‭related costs due to inflation‬
‭
‭and maintenance needs. Staffing reductions through attrition and due to projected‬
‭enrollment decline.‬
o‬‭Fund Balance – Assumed that expenditures will‬‭be less than anticipated revenues which‬
‭
‭results in the increase of Fund Balance after 2024-2025.‬
‭ASB Fund‬
o‬‭Revenues and Expenditures averaged for previous‬‭history with assumption they balance‬
‭
‭Debt Service Fund‬
o‬‭Revenues and Expenditures are amounts projected‬‭to meet principal and interest‬
‭
‭payment obligations‬
‭Capital Projects Fund‬
o‬‭Revenues – assume minimal income‬
‭
o‬‭Expenditures – assume expenditures to complete‬‭projects as funds are available‬
‭
o‬‭Fund Balance – assume 1% of General Fund appropriations‬‭to maintain a balance‬
‭
‭Transportation Vehicle Fund‬
o‬‭Revenues – assume Depreciation funding continues‬
‭
o‬‭Expenditures – assume‬‭the replacement of buses as needed to maintain fleet‬

2/ G.L. 535 is an account that is used to summarize actions for other financing uses such as long-term financing and debt extinguishments. Nonvoted debts
may be serviced in the Debt Service Fund (DSF) rather than in the fund that received the debt proceeds. In order to provide the resources to retire the debt, a
transfer is used by the General Fund, Capital Projects Fund, or Transportation Vehicle Fund to transfer resources to the DSF. Refer to Page DS3 for detail of

BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATION
The State of Washington requires the Board of Directors to annually certify to the
county legislative authority the estimated taxes to be collected for the school district in
the next calendar year on or before the thirtieth (30th) day of November.
In addition, excess levies for the General Fund are limited to the maximum amount of
$2.50 per thousand of assessed valuation. Voters in our District approved a 4-year
Educational Program and Operation levy for collection in January 2022 through
December 2025. The amount authorized for collection in 2025 is $12,791,000. Based
on estimated assessed valuation, we anticipate the rate per thousand to be less than
the current rate per thousand of $1.70.
The levy amount for the Debt Service Fund is the amount required to meet principal
and interest obligations on voted debt.
Levy amounts are included in the 2024-2025 budget presented for approval on
August 19, 2024.

 Revenue: The amounts in this column are what we are anticipating to receive this year. It will be
updated as we move through the year. Some programs, the revenue is dependent on enrollment,
and it will change month to month. It is subtle and does not usually have a significant impact on a
program.
 Year to Date Expenditures: This column shows what has been spent on the specific program
through the current month reported.
 Projected Annualized: This will increase as we move further along in the year. The amounts in the
column are year to date actual expenditures, plus projected expenditures. The salary and benefits of
staff are projected throughout the year so we can anticipate the over all costs of the programs.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATION
At our Board of Directors meeting on June 10, 2024 we had a full audience. Eight
people made public comments about fairness and safety in female sports. As you
remember, our speakers were especially respectful of both transgender athletes and
biologically female athletes. All speakers wanted students to be treated respectfully
and have athletic opportunities. The prevailing concern, however, was biological
differences that affected a recent competition, and future safety concerns.
We must follow WIAA regulations, state and federal laws, and are not the decision
makers on this issue. We do, however, have a duty to support all Eastmont student
athletes, and to represent the views expressed by our community. Therefore, I am
providing you with drafts of a letter and of a resolution for your consideration and
potential approval.

[City, State, Zip Code]
Dear [Legislator's Name],
On behalf of the Eastmont School District Board of Directors, we hope this letter finds
you well. We are writing to address a pressing concern within our community regarding
the participation of transgender athletes who are biologically male in sports designated
for females.
As a school board committed to equity, fairness, and the well-being of all students, we
recognize the importance of ensuring that every student has the opportunity to
participate fully in school activities, including sports. However, recent developments
have underscored significant challenges within our current athletic framework. The
participation of transgender athletes who were assigned male at birth in female sports
categories has raised legitimate concerns about fairness, safety, and the competitive
balance for female athletes.
In light of these concerns, we respectfully request your support in changing current
legislation to provide clear guidance on the participation of transgender athletes in
school sports. This legislative change should ensure that policies uphold fairness in
competition while protecting the rights and dignity of all student athletes.
Specifically, we propose the following considerations for legislative action:
1. Legislative Review and Guidance: We urge you to initiate a thorough review of
existing laws and provide clear legislative guidance on how school districts can
navigate the participation of transgender athletes in sports. This guidance should
be informed by scientific evidence and aim to maintain fair competition for all
students.
2. Support for Equitable Policies: Advocate for legislative measures that allow
transgender athletes to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity,
while also implementing necessary safeguards to ensure fair competition for all
students.
3. Collaboration with School Districts: Work collaboratively with school districts
to develop inclusive policies that uphold the competitive integrity of girls' sports,
considering the unique circumstances and needs of each community.
4. Education and Awareness: Promote legislative efforts that enhance education
and awareness within our community about transgender issues, fostering
understanding, empathy, and respect for all students.

- DRAFT -

By working together with legislators and stakeholders, we believe we can find balanced
solutions that support inclusivity while preserving the fairness and integrity of school
sports programs. Your leadership and support on this critical matter would be invaluable
to our efforts.
Thank you for your attention to this important issue affecting our students and
community. We look forward to discussing this further and working towards legislative
changes that benefit all students in the Eastmont School District.
Sincerely,
[School Board President's Name]
