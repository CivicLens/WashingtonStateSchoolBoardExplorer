See our Board Docs Page below for meeting agendas and minutes. Meeting Agendas and Minutes Find them here: Board Docs The Onalaska School District provides a challenging, engaging, and accessible education for all students in a caring and safe environment. We do this by providing a strong curriculum in Math, Reading, Science, History, and Health. Our goals are to teach each student to think for themselves and develop problem-solving skills which they can apply to life's challenges. The district provides each student the support and assistance needed as individuals. We succeed in this when our students graduate career and college ready. Public Comments Public Comments are welcome at every regular board meeting. Please state your name and topic to record in the minutes and limit your speech to 3 minutes. The Open Public Meetings Act does not allow the Board to discuss, comment upon, or make decisions on topics that were not published in the agenda. This is done so everyone will see what topics the board will act upon during the meeting. This is why we simply say thank you when you have finished speaking during Public Comments or ask an administrator to follow up. If you want to present a topic to the board: a letter from you about your topic needs to be delivered to the district office the Monday before the board meeting so your topic can be added to the agenda. This will allow the board to discuss and, if needed, act upon the agenda item during the regular board meeting.
