Public Hearing on Adoption of 2023-24 Budget

opportunity for anyone who would like to speak for or against the adoption of the 202425 budget to comment before the board takes action on the budget later this evening. No
audience presented, and no public testimony was offered or shared in written form
relating to the proposed budget adoption.
Audience:
• Monika Reynolds is the parent of students at Wade King Elementary. She expressed
her concern for student safety after learning of a lawsuit that has been filed against
the district.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• The board will be asked this evening to approve the 2024-25 budget. Dr. Baker talked
about how inflation has affected the funding that schools receive from the state. He
presented slides that show district revenue and expenditures over the past several
years, reflecting the dramatic increase in utility and insurance costs. It is hoped that
the legislature will make changes in the state budget that will more fully fund all
aspects of education. Dr. Baker expressed appreciation to the finance team and others
who helped to prepare the proposed budget. Board members thanked Dr. Baker and
his team for preparing a budget document that reflects the work within the district and
for Dr. Baker’s advocacy with state legislators.
• Dr. Baker shared photos from recent student performances at Joe Martin Field,
including singing, cheer and dance. There has been a lot of staff professional
development happening, and he displayed photos of:

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Mr. Ritchey’s family received the Family Handbook, which is such a great resource.
• Ms. Rose shared that the arrival of the Family Handbook at her home is a signal that
her family needs to start adjusting their schedules. She has been hearing from and
talking with community members about the district budget. One thing that is not
included in the budget document is how big the deficits are due to the lack of funding
by the state.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler noted that she and Mr. Benjamin have met as a small committee
and will report at tomorrow’s board retreat. She also talked about a recent vacation
with her grandchildren.
• Mr. Benjamin shared that WSSDA has named Tricia Lubach as its new executive
director. There will be a WSSDA board meeting this Saturday, and Mr. Benjamin will
attend via Zoom. He was privileged to meet with Dr. Baker and Senator Sharon
Shewmake recently. Ms. Shewmake listened and appeared to be very informed about
the state’s education budget.
