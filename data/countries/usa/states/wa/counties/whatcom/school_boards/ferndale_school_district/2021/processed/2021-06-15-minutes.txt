3. MATTERS RESERVED FOR BOARD ACTION
3.01 Interview of Consultant Candidates to Provide Superintendent Search Services
The three search firms who presented to the board over Zoom calls were - in order of
presentation - BWP & Associates, McPherson & Jacobson LLC, and Northwest Leadership Associates.
Although consultants from the three firms had differing presentation styles, all three made
similar offers to the school board. The consultants described their firms’ respective search processes,
which involve focus groups with students, staff and community members; online surveys; aggressive
recruitment of candidates, and more. All three firms also touted recent successes with superintendent
searches for other western Washington school districts, and made a two-year guarantee - if the chosen

candidate either left or was fired within two years of starting, the firms would conduct the search again
with fees waived.
After the consultants’ respective presentations, board members asked the consultants questions.
Inquiries included how the firms structure compensation and salary packages for superintendents, how
the firms emphasized offering an ethnically diverse candidate pool, and how they obtained input from
less vocal members of the community.
4. EXECUTIVE SESSION
This part of the meeting was cancelled and replaced with a discussion in open session.
5. MATTERS RESERVED FOR BOARD ACTION
5.01 Award Contract for Consulting Services in Regard to Search for New Superintendent of Ferndale
Schools
Board members and administrators discussed the pros and cons of the three search firms.
Although board members had positive things to say about all three, the general consensus was that
board members were impressed by Northwest Leadership Associates’ attention to detail, polish and
local connections.
Kevin Erickson moved to enter into a contract with Northwest Leadership Associates, pending
positive reference checks, for the purpose of that firm providing superintendent search services.
Final resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Andrew McLaurin, Kevin Erickson, Lee Anne Riddle, Jessie Deardorff, Melinda Cool
