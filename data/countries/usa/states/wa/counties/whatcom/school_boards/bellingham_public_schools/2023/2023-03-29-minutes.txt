The AVID program will support us as we apply for scholarships.

• AVID builds character and is teaching me to be a leader.
• It helps me to be a critical thinker and problem solver.
• There is a community within our AVID classes.
• It helps me be more organized, independent and responsible. I’ve become neater
in general.
• I don’t really like school, but AVID helps me like school sometimes.

AVID teachers than with other teachers.
• It has helped me become more involved in school and afterschool activities.
• AVID is helping me to prepare for the future in all aspects, not just as it pertains
to school.

• Teachers let kids know they can do hard things, like write essays and public
speaking.

note taking and test preparation.

What are some things you would like adults to know about what it is like to be a
middle school student?
• I look forward to Fun Fridays. A lot of the teachers have fun things for us to do on
Fridays.
• In elementary school I wasn’t as nice, but now I don’t get into as much trouble as
I used to.
• When it comes to trust and respect, adults need to trust middle schoolers.
• Being motivated makes school seem less serious and stressful.
• It can be hard to trust adults.
• Adding stress for students does not help our mental health.
• It’s helpful when teachers explain things in different ways.
• 7th and 8th graders need more unscheduled breaks in the afternoon.
• Some days middle schoolers don’t want to be at school and additional physical
breaks are helpful.
• Middle school is very different than elementary school and students start to face
choices that are not helpful, like vaping.
• Once people have an idea of what you’re like, it’s hard to be anything else.
