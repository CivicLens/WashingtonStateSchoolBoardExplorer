summary: The Blaine School District No. 503 held a Special Board Meeting on July 8, 2024, to discuss the results of a recent audit conducted by the Washington State Auditor's Office (SAO). The meeting, led by President Cliff Freeman, included a summary of the Accountability Audit Report for the period from September 1, 2021, to August 31, 2023, which found no deficiencies in the district's internal controls over financial reporting and confirmed adequate protection of public funds. The audit also reviewed major federal program compliance and financial statements for the period of September 1, 2022, to August 31, 2023, concluding that the district complied with relevant requirements and that its financial statements fairly represented its financial position. 

Tyra Elliott, the SAO Audit Lead, commended the district's financial management, noting that no reportable concerns were found during the audit, and Elizabeth Corcoran, SAO Assistant Audit Manager, provided information on how the public could access the final audit report. The district's cost for the audit was consistent with the original estimate, and the next accountability audit is scheduled for 2025. Dr. Granger expressed gratitude to the auditors and Amber Porter for her support throughout the audit process.
