  2. Discussion Item (9:05 a.m.)
A. Board Policy 1800 OE-1: Student-Focused Fundamentals - Fundamental 1 - Personalized Learning - Review and Discussion
Superintendent Rundle indicated that the morning discussion would revolve around Fundamental 1, the District's policy on personalized learning and instructional practices. He then introduced Dr. Ray Smith, who will led the discussion. Dr. Smith has co-authored several books with his wife, Dr. Julie Smith, on topics including evaluating instructional leadership, instructional coaching, and school improvement. Dr. Smith has also collaborated with Dr. John Hattie, a prominent educational researcher. Dr. Smith provided background on his work with Dr. Hattie and then provided an overview of Dr. Hattie's research, which has analyzed over 200 million students across 132,000 studies. He explained the concept of "effect size," a measure of the impact a given practice has on student achievement. An effect size of 0.4 is considered the baseline for a year's worth of growth. Dr. Hattie has categorized various influences on student achievement into different domains. Discussion was held around specific teaching practices and their effect sizes. Direct instruction and lecturing were shown to have negative or low impact, while practices like classroom discussion, cognitive task analysis, and success criteria were highlighted as having high impact when implemented well. Dr. Smith emphasized the importance of teachers and leaders collaborating to understand the evidence around effective practices and their impact on student learning.
  The Board worked in pairs to read about and discuss four high-impact teaching practices. Discussion occurred around the challenges and considerations in implementing these practices effectively to create a personalized, student-centered learning environment, such as ensuring equitable access, supporting English Language Learners, and establishing clear routines and expectations. Discussion shifted to Fundamental 1. Board directors acknowledged the need to potentially revise policy language to focus more broadly on "learning" rather than just "personalized learning." Discussion was held around defining the "why" (the core value driving the policy), the "how" (the specific teaching practices to implement), and the "what" (the measures to monitor progress). Suggestions were made to modify the policy language to emphasize learning as the primary goal for students, teachers, leaders, and the broader school community. The Board also explored potential metrics, such as the percentage of teachers whose students demonstrate more than a year's worth of growth, the percentage implementing high-impact practices, and students' ability to articulate their own learning goals and progress. The Board committed to further discussion on refining Fundamental 1 to better reflect a vision of the District as a "learning organization" focused on maximizing the impact of teaching and leadership practices on student outcomes.
  3. Recess (12:00 p.m.)
The Board recessed for lunch at approximately 11:57 a.m.
The meeting resumed at approximately 12:40 p.m.
  4. Discussion Item (1:00 p.m.)
A. Board Policy 1800 OE-10: Instructional Program - Review iReady Math
Afternoon discussion transitioned to the iReady assessment tool used by the District. Executive Director Nova Williams introduced Brittany Michaels, Jeff Blackburn, and Lintrail Dukes with Curriculum Associates, who will led the discussion. iReady representatives presented iReady as an adaptive assessment tool that provides both norm-referenced and criterion-referenced data on student performance. The Board learned about the different domains assessed, the adaptive nature of the test, and how the data is used to inform instruction and measure growth. Discussion was held around the importance of using multiple data sources, not just iReady, to get a comprehensive understanding of student learning. Strategies for using iReady data to identify students in need of additional support or enrichment, as well as to measure individual student growth, were explored.
  The Board reflected on the day's discussions and their takeaways, which centered around the importance of a learning-focused mindset, the need to establish clear measures and monitoring systems, and the value of using multiple data sources to drive instructional decisions. The Board expressed appreciation for the opportunity to engage deeply with the research and considerations around effective instructional practices and personalized learning.
