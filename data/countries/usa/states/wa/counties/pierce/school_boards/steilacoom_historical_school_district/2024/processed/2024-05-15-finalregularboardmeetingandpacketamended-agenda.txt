What is UFLI?
UFLI Foundations is an explicit and systematic program created by the team at the
University of Florida Literacy Institute (UFLI—pronounced “you fly”). The program
introduces students to the foundational reading skills necessary for proficient reading. It
follows a carefully developed scope and sequence designed to ensure that students
systematically acquire each skill needed and learn to apply each skill with automaticity and
confidence. The program is designed to be used for core instruction in the primary
grades or for intervention with struggling students in any grade.

UFLI Foundations Pilot
• Piloted UFLI Foundations on all three Tiers of Instruction
⚬ Tier I - whole class
⚬ Tier II - enrichment/intervention - both push-in and pull-out out
⚬ Tier III - Special Education setting

Pilot Team Recommends to the IMC for Curriculum Adoption for 24-25 School Year

• 18 Teachers from 4 Elementary Schools
⚬ 15 credits
⚬ Will be awarded a Dyslexia Certification from Pacific University
of Oregon in December of 2024
⚬ Eligible to take the KPEERI exam (Knowledge and Practice
Examination for Effective Reading Instruction) which measures
an educator’s knowledge of the principles and practices of
Structured Literacy

Packet page 10 of 218

Saltar’s Point Teacher - Danielle Asato

“It has been a wonderful opportunity to grow as an educator
and work toward the dyslexia certification. Having dyslexia
myself, I have been able to learn a lot about myself and how I
also relate to the content we are learning. This is allowing me
to help many of my students, not only the students who are
diagnosed with dyslexia. I enjoy interacting with other
teachers in our district and seeing their findings and
perspective teaching other grade levels.”

Packet page 11 of 218

Saltar’s Point Teacher - Matt Rauschendorfer
“The Dyslexia Certification course has been a wonderful
opportunity for me to keep learning and growing as an
educator! The knowledge I have learned so far has helped
me spot potential signs of dyslexia among current
students while reflecting on experiences of past students.
This has been eye-opening and I am so thrilled that I am
able to continue along in this work!”

Packet page 12 of 218

Chloe Clark Teacher - Jennifer Reger
“Taking classes to better understand how closely connected the fundamentals of reading
and writing are to the learning process for students has been eye opening. I could try to
impress you with academic language to show you my learning, but the bottom line is that
I am being very intentional in allowing students time to understand the relationship
between letters and sounds by engaging them in new activities. During whole group
lessons we are using our hands to "pound and sound" out new vocabulary or spelling
words, we are "read, spell, writing" high frequency words and we are reading texts aloud.
In small groups students have been utilizing Elkonin boxes on white boards to help spell
words, we are using mirrors to see how our mouths create sounds and we are pulling that
all together with reading decodable texts. While some of these tools I have always used,
many of the concepts of how to implement them in order to include auditory, visual and
written components within each new concept is new.”

Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

From: Shawn Lewis
Subject: Financial Update
Attached are the Budget Status Reports for all funds as of the end of April 2024, along with
charts and data showing our monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund cash
balance.
Enrollment is generally flat – no significant increase or decrease in our schools or in the Running
Start program.
Our General Fund Balance increased as expected this month to $4.7 million: up $3 million due
to the Educational Programs Levy Collection. As we have been waiting to pay a few large
expenses until levy proceeds were received, our expenditures were higher than normal this
month as well – totaling $4.9 million. Again – this is expected and all expenditures are
continuing to come in consistent with how we anticipated them.
General Fund cash balance as of the end of April is $4,743,507.
Based on our most recent projections, it is likely that we will need a budget extension for the
current year to address the higher Running Start costs. A draft budget extension will be shared
with the board in June and finalized for adoption in August.
No items of significance to report in other funds.

and the exit conference summary are provided.
In summary: The district had no findings related to internal controls. The district had no
findings related to compliance with federal programs The district financial position was found
to be fairly stated in accordance with OSPI and SAO financial reporting requirements There
were a few recommendations made by the auditors related to financial reporting and internal
controls, but all recommendations were identified as immaterial. Even though immaterial, the
district implemented several of those recommendations and appreciates the work performed by
the State Auditor’s Office.
Due to a finding in the prior year, the district originally anticipated audit costs would be roughly
$35,000 in the current school year. Instead, due to the efforts of district staff and efficient
auditors, the actual costs were under $30,000. Last year, the audit cost the district over $55,000.
The district has already extended its appreciation to the audit staff for their efforts to save the
district resources.
DIrector Rohrer asked if there was an accountability audit this year. Mr. Lewis explained there
was not. She asked if the audit document was on the website. Mr. Lewis shared the district

learned a great deal in his first couple of months on the board.
VII. BOARD COMMUNICATION
The board received communication from Mike Miller, Anderson Island Elementary School
Principal, recommending Cathy Feutz (Sodexo Food Service) for recognition. Mr. Miller shared
Cathy is one of the many reasons AIE is a great place to learn and grow! Not only does she come
out to AIE every day to serve meals, she also volunteers her time for them and other students in
the district. Most recently, she helped in the "Future Chefs" competition at the high school.
Cathy stays after school and helps with our Craft Club, where she works with the students doing
needlepoint. She is absolutely a bright light here on AI. She loves the students, and it is obvious
that she is willing to go above and beyond for any of them and their families.
Shae Emery, Maintenance and Facilities Manager, also communicated with the board
regarding outstanding SHSD employee Duc Vo. Over the past 5 years, Mr. Vo has displayed
outstanding dedication and hard work. He is committed to finishing each tasks he is faced with
to completion, leaving no detail unaccounted for. Duc exemplifies what it means to be a truly
exceptional employee - always going above and beyond, never shying away from a challenge,
and continuously seeking to expand his knowledge and skills. His positive attitude and upbeat

motivates and inspires those around him. Thank you, Mr. Vo, for all that you do and for making

approved by the superintendent.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

Policy No. 2401
Instruction

COMPETENCY/MASTERY PROFICIENCY BASED CREDITS
The district recognizes the importance of allowing students to learn at their own pace, and the
educational benefits that can be gained by giving students the opportunity to demonstrate
competency of skills, proficiency of standards, and mastery of concepts competency of skills
and concepts.
In order to recognize student proficiency, the superintendent will develop procedures to
award credits to students based on demonstrated masterycompetency/proficiency across a
range of skills in each content area, including but not limited to those identified in this
policy.
To ensure cultural responsiveness and equity in awarding masterycompetency/proficiency-based
credit, the district will collect and annually review disaggregated data to see which subgroups of
students are receiving masterycompetency/proficiency-based credit. If disproportionality is found,
the district will take appropriate actions to ensure equitable access to these crediting opportunities.
Students may obtain credit ranges from (.5) to (2) credits for passing an assessment that is aligned
to state learning standards identified by the district in procedure 2401P. Students do not need to
have attempted and failed a course before being eligible for these options.
Successful completion of next higher-level course: Credit may be awarded for a course when the
student successfully completes the next higher-level course in a sequence that includes a natural
progression of the learning standards from the previous course. State or locally determined
learning standards will be used as the guide when making decisions regarding what courses should
qualify.
One half credit (0.5), in the form of a P, may be awarded for successful completion (C or higher)
of the semester immediately succeeding any failed class, provided that that sequence follows a
natural progression of the same standards from the previous course.
Courses that are equivalent and qualify for College in the High School (CiHS) credit will count
toward graduation requirements as approved by the superintendent.
The Arts
The board recognizes the value of providing students an education in the arts, including the
disciplines of dance, media arts, music, theater, and visual arts. The arts engage all learning
styles, and they lead to powerful and life-long habits, such as creativity, collaboration,
communication, and critical thinking. The arts provide students with keys to understanding the
world around them and strategies for learning, interpreting, and expressing their thoughts.
Students may further develop their art skills through independent activities and programs. The
district encourages students and their families to take advantage of any learning opportunities in
the arts available to them.
The district will encourage students to learn the arts effectively at a high level of competency/
proficiency.

World Languages
The board recognizes the value of preparing students to be global citizens with the skills to
communicate in English and other world languages. In our state's diverse communities, it is not
unusual for students to have various opportunities to develop language skills, for example, by
using the language at home, attending language programs offered in the community, learning
online or living abroad. The district encourages students and their families to take advantage of
any language learning opportunities available to them.
To enable students to fully benefit from the advantages of multilingualism, the district will
encourage students to learn to understand, speak, read and write at a high level of language
proficiency. Proficiency can also be demonstrated in languages that are only spoken or signed.
Health and Fitness
The board recognizes the value of providing students a health and physical education. Health
and physical education comprise extensive content areas that include, but are not limited to, the
development of knowledge and skills to be physically active, eat nutritiously, access reliable
health information and services, communicate effectively, and set health- enhancing goals.
Students may further develop their health and fitness skills through independent activities and
programs. The district encourages students and their families to take advantage of any learning
opportunities in health and physical education available to them.
Social Studies
The board recognizes the value of helping students become part of an active and engaged
citizenry. A developed knowledge and understanding of social studies helps prepare students for
post-secondary pathways, careers, and civic engagement. Students may further develop their
social studies skills through independent activities and programs. The district encourages students
and their families to take advantage of any social studies learning opportunities available to them.
The district will encourage students to learn social studies effectively at a high level of
competency/proficiency. The district also recognizes the importance of allowing students to learn
at their own pace, and the educational benefits that can be gained by giving students the
opportunity to demonstrate competency of skills, proficiency of standards, and mastery of
concepts.
Integrated Environmental and Sustainability Education
The board recognizes the value of providing students instruction about conservation, natural
resources, and the environment and helping students to be environmentally and sustainability
literate. The board places a high value on environmental stewardship. Students may further
develop their environmental and sustainability education skills through independent activities and
programs. The district encourages students and their families to take advantage of any learning
opportunities in environmental and sustainability education available to them.
English Language Arts
The board recognizes the value of preparing students to read, write, speak, listen, and use English
effectively. These skills are necessary for college and career readiness in multiple disciplines. The

develop these skills through independent activities and programs. The district encourages
students and their families to take advantage of any math learning opportunities available to them.
The district will encourage students to use math effectively at a high level of masterycompetency
/proficiency.
Science
The board recognizes the value of preparing students to become literate in science. Science plays
an integral role in modern society and is an essential part of each student’s education. When
students are learning about science, they are also enhancing their skills in reading, writing, and
math. Students may further develop their science skills through independent activities and
programs. The district encourages students and their families to take advantage of any science
learning opportunities available to them.
The district will encourage students to learn science effectively at a high level of competency/
proficiency.
Financial Education

The board recognizes the value of helping students understand the importance of financial
education. Financial education includes knowledge and skills related to spending and saving,
managing credit and debt, using a career plan to understand income potential, setting and working
toward personal financial goals, and applying decision making to matters of personal finance.
When students develop their financial education, they are better prepared for successful postsecondary pathways and careers. The district encourages students and their families to take
advantage of any financial education learning opportunities available to them through
independent activities and programs.
The district will encourage students to learn financial education effectively at a high level of
competency/proficiency.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
SHSD currently utilizes Wonders (McGraw Hill, 2017) as its ELA curriculum in grades K-5. To
further develop foundational literacy skills, we have actively sought a cost-effective supplementary
program to promptly address our students' foundational early literacy needs, in response to student
assessment data.
“UFLI Foundations is an explicit and systematic program created by the team at the
University of Florida Literacy Institute (UFLI—pronounced “you fly”). The program introduces
students to the foundational reading skills necessary for proficient reading.
It follows a carefully developed scope and sequence designed to ensure that students
systematically acquire each skill needed and learn to apply each skill with automaticity
and confidence. The program is designed to be used for core instruction in the primary
grades or for intervention with struggling students in any grade.”
Through the DoDEA grant, Operation ELEVATE, the Steilacoom Historical School District began
piloting UFLI Foundations to improve phonics instruction in the fall and winter of the 2023-2024
school year. Our pilot team took a diverse approach, testing the program in all three tiers of
instruction (whole class, small group intervention, and a special education setting) to get a sense of
how well it could work in all areas of our schools. To evaluate progress and gather feedback,
quantitative data was collected, a survey and focus group were conducted.
Teachers participating in the UFLI pilot shared insights into their experiences through the survey
and focus group discussions. Feedback highlighted overall satisfaction with the program's userfriendliness and effectiveness in both whole class and intervention settings.
The impact on student learning was a central focus of the evaluation, revealing encouraging
outcomes across various literacy skills. Teachers observed significant improvements in decoding
ability, fluency, and overall confidence in reading. Notably, UFLI was credited with transformative
effects, particularly for students with dyslexia, who showed remarkable progress. Moreover, the
program positively influenced highly capable students, fostering advanced language skills and
critical thinking abilities. Overall, teachers noted increased student engagement, confidence, and
willingness to tackle complex texts, indicating a promising trajectory for UFLI's role in enhancing
literacy education within the district.
The Instructional Materials Committee (IMC) reviewed the UFLI materials on 5/1/2024.

Packet page 115 of 218

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
The Instructional Materials Committee recommends that the Board adopt UFLI Foundations as an
explicit and systematic phonics program for K-2 as a supplement to our current ELA curriculum.

Developed for teachers, by teachers, with teachers

What is UFLI Foundations?
UFLI Foundations is an explicit and systematic program created by the team at the
University of Florida Literacy Institute (UFLI—pronounced “you fly”). The program
introduces students to the foundational reading skills necessary for proficient reading.
It follows a carefully developed scope and sequence designed to ensure that students
systematically acquire each skill needed and learn to apply each skill with automaticity
and confidence. The program is designed to be used for core instruction in the primary
grades or for intervention with struggling students in any grade.

How does it work?
UFLI Foundations provides teachers with detailed but easy to follow lesson plans that
follow this eight-step routine:
1. Phonemic Awareness
2. Visual Drill
3. Auditory Drill
4. Blending Drill
5. New Concept
6. Word Work
7. Irregular Words
8. Connected Text
Steps 1 through 4 serve as a warm-up and review of previously taught concepts. Step
5 is an explicit introduction to a new concept, including guided practice reading and
spelling words. Steps 6 through 8 are opportunities to apply concepts through reading
and writing activities at the word and text level.

Packet page 117 of 218

What specific skills are targeted in the program?
UFLI Foundations targets the following foundational reading skills:
o Phoneme blending and segmentation practice
o Accuracy and automaticity of grapheme-phoneme correspondences
o Decoding automaticity of words with previously learned concepts
o Explicit introduction of new concepts
o Decoding and encoding practice
o Reading and spelling irregular words
o Reading and spelling connected text

What is special about UFLI Foundations?
UFLI Foundations strikes the perfect balance between structure and responsiveness to
students’ needs. The program features ample opportunities for students to practice,
along with built-in gradual release. It provides teachers with detailed lesson plans, an
instructional slide deck to accompany each lesson, and downloadable materials for
homework or center activities.
UFLI Foundations is an example of an educative curriculum. This means that simply
using the materials and lesson structure will add to your professional knowledge and
skills in key areas:
o The process of reading acquisition
o Key linguistic elements necessary for reading
o Evidence-based instructional methods that promote reading proficiency
Another key component that sets UFLI Foundations apart is the professional
development available to prepare teachers to implement the lessons. You may choose
to take advantage of webinars, videos of lesson components being taught, and other
online resources that will help you make the most of UFLI Foundations.

Packet page 118 of 218

Is UFLI Foundations aligned with the science of reading?
If you are familiar with the science of reading, you may have heard of the “simple view
of reading,” (Gough & Tunmer, 1986) which states that reading comprehension is the
product of decoding and linguistic comprehension. This concept can be visualized as a
mathematical formula:

If either decoding or linguistic comprehension is weak, the effect is multiplied. That is,
you can never have better reading comprehension than the level of development of
either your decoding or linguistic comprehension skills.
With this in mind, UFLI Foundations addresses the “D” part of the equation: decoding.
In many instances, students fail assessments of reading comprehension not because
they cannot synthesize complex ideas presented in text, but because they do not have
access to such ideas because they cannot decode the text. Ensuring students can
fluently decode text affords them the opportunity to apply and refine their linguistic
comprehension skills, construct meaning from text, and more accurately demonstrate
their understanding on assessments.

Is UFLI Foundations research-based? Is UFLI Foundations evidence-based?
UFLI Foundations is research-based. This means it was developed to align with what
decades of reading research has shown to be effective. We incorporated findings from
research on word reading development and effective instruction to build an explicit
and systematic program for teaching children to read and spell words.
UFLI Foundations is also evidence-based. Before releasing the program, we spent two
full years developing and piloting each component. We observed lessons, and we got
feedback from teachers who were using the program. Most importantly, we assessed
student progress, and we found that students who received instruction using UFLI
Foundations made significant gains in phonemic awareness, decoding, and oral
reading fluency.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

District staff has prepared the 2025-2030 Capital Facilities Plan for school board and community
review. Following a 14-day SEPA notice period and review by the Town of Steilacoom, City of
DuPont, and Pierce County, the board will be asked to consider the final plan at their regularly
scheduled June school board meeting.
The plan this year incorporates new studies on student generation rates and enrollment
projections. Those studies are included in the board’s background materials.
Also included in this year’s updated plan are impact fee calculations that address statutory changes
regarding impact fees. Specifically, the plan now calls out specific types of residential units where
no fee is collected, and provides for a discretionary reduction for certain fees. These will be
covered in the presentation.
The Capital Facilities Plan is shared with the Town of Steilacoom, the City of DuPont, Pierce County
and the greater SHSD community. This plan will be adopted by reference as a part of the local
jurisdiction’s Comprehensive Plan for purposes of identifying whether school facilities are adequate
to serve existing and proposed new development.

TAB 1 INTRODUCTION
The Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 (SHSD) has prepared this Capital Facilities Plan
(CFP) to assess the facilities needed to accommodate projected student enrollment at
acceptable levels of service, as well as a more detailed schedule and financing program for
capital improvements, over the next six years (2025-2030). The CFP is intended to be shared
with the Town of Steilacoom, the City of DuPont, Pierce County and the greater SHSD
community. This report assesses the following:
•
•
•
•

The anticipated growth within the District’s boundaries;
The anticipated school enrollment growth through the 2025-2030 planning period;
The new school facilities required to meet the needs of this expanding student
enrollment; and
As applicable, the school impact fee calculations based on the capacity projects
necessary to address growth needs.

Residential development has historically preceded any school construction and has never
progressed in an orderly and coordinated manner. Selection of school sites and the
construction of schools have generally followed the construction of new homes. This historic
process of school construction following residential growth has left a gap between available
space and the student population. As a result, schools have commonly become overcrowded.
Compounding the situation is the state’s historic and consistent underfunding of the State
Construction Assistance Program by using construction cost allocations and eligible area
estimates that are far below normal and reasonable levels. In addition, the required time to
acquire property, design facilities, acquire all necessary permits, and to construct facilities also
contributes to overcrowded schools.
Relief for overcrowded schools has primarily come from local residents who have supported tax
levies and bond issues. Voter approval of school levies and bond issues is becoming more
difficult as other interests vie for property tax dollars. In addition, many existing residents are
questioning the equity of having to pay the full costs of the educational facilities needed to
serve new residents. In an effort to overcome the perceived inequity of property tax supported
levies and bond issues, school districts have sought conditions upon development activity to
provide a share of the local financial support needed for the construction of school facilities.
This Capital Facilities Plan is designed to support the use of school impact fees as provided for
under the 1990 Growth Management Act. Therefore, this Plan consists of:
•
•
•
•

An inventory of the existing schools, support facilities and properties owned by
Steilacoom Historical School District No.1;
An enrollment history and projection for the 2025-2030 time frame;
An identification of the District’s current “level of service” with respect to capital
facilities;
A forecast of the District’s need for new construction, modernization, and new
construction-in-lieu-of modernization; and

SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 5 of 35
Packet page 125 of 218

•

A plan that will finance the proposed construction projects within projected funding
capacities and clearly identify sources of public money for such purposes. The CFP is
designed to support school impact fees authorized by Pierce County, as implemented by
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 and other municipalities that may collect
school impact fees on behalf of the District.

In addition, the CFP will also provide a basis for mitigation under the State Environmental
Protection Act (SEPA) or the State Subdivision Act.

Land/Parcel Holdings and Disposition

In 2010, the District purchased a 13.5-acre parcel (tax parcel identification No. 761500022
located immediately directly north of Steilacoom High School. In November 2013, the Board
passed Resolution 810-11-13-13 to approve the surplus of a 3.77-acre portion of that site, and it
remains for sale. It is the intent of the District to utilize a portion of this site for additional
parking and athletic fields. The timing of this expansion is subject to the successful passage of
a bond proposition.
In July 2022, the Board approved the purchase of a 10-acre elementary school site in the City of
DuPont located on McNeil Street adjacent to Marshall Circle. The District intends to construct
the next elementary school on this site. The timing of this expansion is subject to the successful
passage of a bond proposition.
The District owns a 14.71-acre site located on Manchester Place within the City of DuPont.
This 14.71-acre site in DuPont was intended to serve as the location for a planned new school.
The Board declared this property surplus subsequent to the acquisition of the McNeil Street
property in 2022. The 14.71-acre site is currently available for sale.

History of Capital Facility Planning and Construction

To meet increasing population and provide a sturdier building, the Town of Steilacoom
approved in 1913 the construction of a new brick structure at the cost of $15,000.
During the early part of the 1990’s, about a dozen portable classrooms were placed to
accommodate the growing enrollment at Cherrydale Primary School, Saltar’s Point Elementary,
and Pioneer Middle School. After the Town of Steilacoom placed a moratorium on the number
of portables that could be sited, the District held public information meetings designed to
inform residents about the critical situation. When the bond election was held in 1996 to
approve general obligation bonds of $38,000,000, voters rejected it. A second election, held in
the following year was approved.
In 1997, voters approved by over 60%, a proposition for construction and improvements to the
District’s elementary schools and high school but rejected a second proposition to build a new
middle school.
Instead, the old Steilacoom School serving as Pioneer Middle School underwent an extensive
retro-fit to make the building earthquake safe. In addition, the cafeteria was remodeled and
enlarged and the gymnasium floor was replaced. The results of that retro-fit were
demonstrated during the February 28, 2001 earthquake. A portion of Proposition #1, or
$2,003,000, was designated for technology—computers, software and related equipment.
Following approval of the 1997 Capital Facilities Bond, plans were started for work on
Cherrydale Primary School, Saltar’s Point Elementary School, and Anderson Island Elementary

School. To accommodate school-age students in the DuPont community, ground was broken in
fall 2000 for a new elementary school. Chloe Clark Elementary School was dedicated in August
2001 and 180 students were enrolled for the following school year.
On May 17, 2005, District voters approved Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 to issue
$55.9 million dollars in general obligation bonds to finance a 6-year construction program.
The District received approximately $17. 1 million dollars in state match dollars to assist in
funding.
The 2005 bond projects included:

Modernizing the existing portion of Steilacoom High School
Building a new multi-purpose room at Anderson Island Elementary School
Completing other priority renovations/modernization projects

Bond sales were executed in two phases: June 2005, $22 million dollars and July 2006, $33.9
million dollars. The 2005 bond projects are complete.
The board passed in November 2012 Resolution 787-10-24-12 to approve the addition of a
modular building containing two classrooms to be placed at Saltar's Point Elementary to
accommodate enrollment growth. The two classrooms are now in place.
In 2008, the Board of Directors gave the Citizens Advisory Committee the task of exploring
options regarding the buildings that make up the old Pioneer Middle School site. The
Committee’s recommendation included consolidation of all SHSD administrative offices into the
1918 building. The District converted the 1918 Building into an administrative building in
August of 2014 which has enabled all of the District’s administrative staff to be housed in one
building.
In the fall of 2016, the Board of Directors discussed the development of a comprehensive
facility improvement plan for the District. It adopted a community based process that included
board presentations, listening sessions, and a community based committee. The committee
provided a set of recommendations to the Board of Directors in October 2018 and finalized
their recommendations in November of 2018. The committee recommendations included:
• Increasing facility capacity at each school level,
• Construction of a maintenance/transportation facility, and
• Special program spaces to meet the needs of students and the community.
In October 2022, the Board of Directors resolved to place a bond measure before voters in
February 2023 that would have:
• Built an elementary school in DuPont, addressing capacity issues at all elementary
schools within the district;
• Constructed an expanded performing arts center at the high school;

•

Provided an additional athletic field and a covered stadium at the high school;
Increased facility capacity at the middle and high school;
Improved traffic safety and flow at all schools; and
Addressed ongoing facility safety and security needs for students.

Voters narrowly defeated the bond measure in February 2023 and again in April 2023. The
board intends to re-engage the community in broad based process prior to placing another
bond issue on the ballot. In November 2023, voters approved a capital and technology levy to
address some of the more emergent capital needs that could be funded through a levy without
a significant increase in the overall tax rate within the district.

Future Capital Facility Plans

The District’s projected enrollment growth is anticipated to be greatest at the elementary level
over the next six years. Elementary schools are also impacted by increased special education
needs and other special programs. Modest growth is also expected at both the middle and high
school.
A significant factor of the projected enrollment growth is directly related to additional planned
housing in the Old Fort Lake Subarea in DuPont. A new development is in the planning process
which includes between 2,750 and 4,000 housing units. Developers have indicated that the
housing units would be added over a period of 6 years, but the exact timing depends on a
variety of external factors. Demographers and city staff have indicated that the complete
development is more likely to occur over a 10 to 20-year period. Enrollment projections
anticipate the housing additions over a 10-year period.
To meet these capacity needs, the Board envisions the need for another school for K-5 students
in DuPont. If a new elementary school is not constructed, the District would need to add
additional classrooms at Chloe Clark as an interim planning measure. In July 2022, the Board
approved the purchase of a 10-acre elementary school site in the City of DuPont located on
McNeil Street adjacent to Marshall Circle. The District intends to construct the next elementary
school on this site. Discussions are underway with developers who intend to build multifamily
housing in the City of DuPont regarding additional school sites and other mitigation measures
that may be required, which could impact the location of the next elementary school
Subject to voter approval, the District intends to begin construction of this school during the six
year planning period of this Capital Facilities Plan.
The District will also consider other alternatives to address enrollment growth including but not
limited to adding modular classrooms at existing schools within the District.

TAB III STUDENT ENROLLMENT TRENDS
1.

DISTRICT GROWTH

Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 has reviewed historical demographic trends and
actual enrollments. The combined student population from the Town of Steilacoom, the City of
DuPont, and Pierce County is expected to result in an overall increase in student enrollment
due to increased residential growth within these communities.
Using in-school building enrollment figures, the District’s elementary school enrollment (grades
K-5) grew from 966 students in 2003 to 1,305 students in 2023. During that same period, the
Middle School (grades 6-8) student enrollment grew from 529 students to 745 students.
Overall student enrollment for grades 9-12 increased from 675 students in 2003 to 785 FTE
(headcount of 913 students) in 2023. Fall 2023 enrollment figures show continued long-term
growth at the elementary and secondary levels, though the most current years have been
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The District is monitoring stabilization of enrollment
following this impact.
The District implemented the following grade configuration model to address actual and
projected growth of the elementary school student population:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.

Anderson Island Elementary School:
Cherrydale Primary School:

Grades Pre-K-3rd
Grades Pre-K to 3rd
Grades Pre-K to 3rd
Grades 4th to 5th
Grades 6th to 8th
Grades 9th to 12th

This grade configuration model may change once a new elementary school is operational to
allow elementary students in DuPont to be served within DuPont.

2.

ENROLLMENT AND PROJECTIONS

The Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) provides enrollment
projections based on the “Cohort Survival” method. This method of enrollment projection uses
historic patterns of student progression by grade level to measure the portion of students
moving from one grade level up to the next cohort or grade. This ratio or survival rate is used in
conjunction with current birth rates as a base for statewide enrollment projections. The OSPI
system is useful, but has obvious inadequacies in representing the unique growth conditions of
individual school districts. Historically, OSPI projections in growing school districts tend to
underestimate the actual student enrollment growth. Furthermore, the OSPI projections do
not wholly anticipate new students from new development within the District. As such, the
OSPI projections are considered conservative. In addition, recent enrollment anomalies due to
the COVID-19 pandemic make the OSPI projections fairly unreliable for predicting near-term
future enrollment growth.

Packet page 135 of 218

School enrollment growth and distribution over the next six years in Steilacoom Historical
School District will be influenced by several factors. A primary factor will be overall population
growth in the District.
The District is using a modified cohort survival projection for purposes of this Capital Facilities
Plan. The cohort projection was prepared by a consultant and considers historic growth trends,
future building plans and availability, birth rates, as well as economic and various other factors
that contribute to overall population growth. The modified cohort survival rates provide
projections that balance between achieving recency and stability.
Most school districts in the Puget Sound area and across the state experienced enrollment
decreases recently with remote learning and uncertainties related to school instruction. The
SHSD enrollment decrease in 2020-21 was larger on a percentage basis than many other local
school districts. It may take an additional year for enrollment and the associated increases in
student population to return to the prior trend. Because the District updates this CFP on an
annual basis, adjustments will be made annually as needed if COVID 19 assumptions are
incorrect.
The District engaged an outside demographer to conduct a demographic study for the 20252030 Capital Facilities Plan update. This demographic study used a cohort survival model with
adjustments for new housing. There were several alternative forecasts provided and the
District is relying on the demographer’s preferred forecast in the report. The preferred forecast
is based on birth counts, birth forecasts, grade level enrollment trends, and assumptions about
the number of students likely to be added from new home construction over time. For
purposes of the modified cohort survival projection, the demographer’s preferred forecast uses
a six-year average of continuing grades to balance the cohort projections between periods of
decline and increase.
The housing component of the forecast assumes that the District will see a substantial number
of new housing unites added over the next decade. Most of this is related to a project in the
Old Fort Lake Subarea in the City of DuPont – which alone is expected to add about 3,000 units
between 2025 and 2035.
In Steilacoom, a new masterplan community is expected to add residential units within the
Cherrydale attendance area. The types of residential units and timeline for construction has
not been finalized.
The following tables provide the District’s historical enrollment data and the projections by
grade level through the 2029-30 school year.

TAB IV LEVEL OF SERVICE
1.

INTRODUCTION

The Growth Management Act (GMA) requires that school districts provide “level of service” or
“school capacity” data as a component of their Capital Facilities Plan (CFP). The GMA was
developed, in part, to help ensure public services, including schools, necessary to support
development will be adequate to serve said development at the time the development is
available for occupancy and use, without decreasing current service levels below locally
established minimum standards. In other words, each public service needs to clearly define
their service level so that service level can be maintained in the face of new development.

2.

DEFINITION

The “level of service” is based on the number of classrooms available at each school and the
desired average class load. Inherent in the level of service are the types and amounts of space
required to accommodate the District’s adopted educational program. The educational
program standards which typically drive facility space needs include grade configuration,
optimal facility size, class size, educational program offerings, as well as classroom utilization
and scheduling requirements.
In addition to factors that affect the amount of space required, government mandates and
community expectations may affect how classroom space is used. For example, State
requirements related to full day kindergarten and reduced class sizes impact the level of
service. In addition, traditional educational programs offered by school districts are often
supplemented by non-traditional or special programs such as special education – resource and
self-contained, special education 18-21-year-old transitional program, English Language Learner
(ELL), Title I, Learning Assistance Program (LAP), music education, highly capable, special
education preschool, computer labs, career and technical education, etc. These special or nontraditional educational programs can have a significant impact on the available student capacity
of school facilities. For example, the District currently has approximately 425 students
(approximately 13% of its total student population) participating in Special Education Programs.
Variations in student capacity between schools often result in special or non-traditional
programs offered at specific schools. These special programs require classroom space, which
can reduce the permanent capacity of some of the buildings housing these programs. Some
students, for example, leave their regular classroom for a short period of time to receive
instruction in these special programs. Newer schools within the District have been designed to
accommodate many of these programs. However, older schools often require space
modifications to accommodate special programs, and in some circumstances, these
modifications may reduce the overall classroom capacities of the buildings.
District educational program standards will undoubtedly change in the future as a result of
changes in special programs, class sizes, grade span configurations, use of new technology, and
other physical aspects of the school facilities. The school space inventory will be reviewed

SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 19 of 35
Packet page 139 of 218

periodically and adjusted for any changes to the educational program standards. These
changes will also be reflected in future updates of this Capital Facilities Plan.
The District does not consider portables as being ideal instructional space for students and/or
staff members. By design, portable classrooms separate their occupants from the rest of a
school’s student body and/or staff members. In addition, the increased enrollments that
portables afford may exceed the optimal size of the “core” facilities of the permanent
building(s); such spaces as the gymnasium, the library, the restrooms, the main office, and the
food service facilities.

3.

SUMMARY

The Growth Management Act (GMA) requires that school districts provide “level of service” or
“school capacity” data to support requests for impact fees from residential developers. With
respect to public schools, the “level of service” is a quantifiable measure of the capacity
available to support the instruction of students.
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 has elected to define its “level of service” in terms of
each student’s share of the District’s permanent school facilities, with reference to the District’s
standard for average class load and identification of classrooms available for regular instruction.
The level of service (LOS) is dictated by the amount of space required to accommodate the
District’s adopted educational program. The LOS will change as the District changes its
educational program and it must be reviewed and modified periodically.
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 has adopted an organization that houses
kindergarten through fifth grade in elementary schools, sixth through eighth grade in middle
school, and ninth through twelfth grade in high school.
The District has adopted a traditional calendar beginning in late August or early September
(prior to Labor Day) and ending in mid-June, and a traditional daily schedule with academic
classes beginning in the early morning (between 7:35 a.m. and 9:05 a.m.) and ending 6.5 hours
after the start time. Although the District continues to study alternate organizations, calendars,
and schedules, the District believes the adopted organization is educationally sound and
reflects community values.
The District’s educational program includes individual and small group work, as well as full class
activities. Portable classrooms, which are neither intended for nor function as long term
educational space, are excluded from the level of service calculation. Portables are considered
adequate only for supplemental programs and interim housing.
The capacity for each facility is established by multiplying the regular classrooms available by
the District’s standard for average class load (the “Standard of Service”). Spaces used for
special program needs are excluded from the definition of regular classrooms. Core facilities
and special use facilities are compared to classroom capacity to confirm that facility capacity is
not limited by limitations in core facilities.
The District’s adopted Standard of Service is as follows:

TAB V THE DISTRICT’S CONSTRUCTION PLAN
1.

INTRODUCTION

From district to district, it is common to find variations in the grade level configurations, class
size requirements and instructional programs depending upon a local community’s educational
philosophy and the needs of the students to be served. Such variations between districts do
impact the design and the cost of newly constructed school facilities.
In late 2016, the district began a planning process with a Capital Facilities Advisory Committee
made up of community members, staff, district officials, students, Town of Steilacoom and City
of DuPont representatives. The Committee began their work in 2018. The purpose of the
Steilacoom Historical School District’s Facilities Advisory Committee (FAC) was:
•
•

•

Establish a long-term Capital Projects Plan
Recommend short- and long-term solutions related to the District’s deferred
maintenance, educational adequacy of schools, safety and security, future plans and use
of district property; and
Consider a future capital bond proposition.

The Capital Facilities Advisory Committee was presented data to study and evaluate the overall
condition of district facilities to identify and prioritize potential facility modifications,
replacements, additions and/or closures to best enhance student achievement opportunities,
and support the ongoing economic development and a healthy community. This data included:
•
•
•

THE NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM

The ability to move forward on the construction of any new school facility in the Steilacoom
Historical School District is dependent on many factors. First, the District needs to have local
funding available to pay for the cost of new school facilities. Normally, school districts secure
the majority of their local funds through the sale of general obligation bonds, as approved by
the qualified voters of their districts. The authority to issue and sell such bonds rests in the
Constitution and laws of the State of Washington, including RCW 28A.530.010 and RCW
84.52.056.
The State of Washington has set forth recommended site size standards, as defined in WAC
392-342-020. Specifically, for an elementary school, the minimum standard is five (5) acres plus
SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 23 of 35
Packet page 143 of 218

an additional one (1) acre for each one hundred (100) pupils of a school’s maximum enrollment.
For junior and senior high schools, the minimum standard is ten (10) acres plus an additional
one (1) acre for each one hundred (100) pupils of a school’s maximum enrollment. These
recommended acreages provide space for the school building(s) and the appropriate support
facilities such as play fields, athletic facilities and parking.
Of particular importance to Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1, is the eligibility for State
School Construction Assistance. Such State assistance is used along with local funds to pay for
the cost of new school facilities. However, State monies cannot be used to purchase school
sites, to make off-site improvements and/or fund those specific items spoken to in WAC 392343-120. The formula for determining the exact amount of State funding assistance a district
can receive is set forth in WAC 392-343-020.
To address capacity needs, the District plans to construct a new elementary school in the City of
DuPont. The District has completed the conceptual design stage for this school but the
District’s voters will need to approve a bond measure to fund the construction of this school.

SUMMARY

To accommodate enrollment growth, Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 completed the
2005 Capital Improvement Program which benefitted four schools. The completion of Phases II
and III to Chloe Clark Elementary School resulted in a student capacity increase from the
original 175 student capacity. The 2,865 square foot multipurpose building at Anderson Island
Elementary was added to accommodate up to 40 students. Pioneer Middle School, which can
hold 775 students, opened in August 2008. The addition and modernization of the existing
Steilacoom High School was completed in 2009. Steilacoom High School can now hold 1,025
students.
Currently, Elementary Schools on the mainland are all over capacity based on Service Standards
(see page 22).
To address projected long term growth in the District, the District plans to construct a new
elementary school in DuPont within the six year planning period of this Capital Facilities Plan.
The District may also add portable facilities as needed to provide interim capacity for
elementary grades.

TAB VI THE DISTRICT’S FINANCE PLAN
1.

INTRODUCTION

The Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 clearly recognizes the long-term value of capital
facilities planning. The execution of the 2005 Capital Improvement Program, discussed earlier
in this report, helped address the District’s need for permanent facilities to accommodate
students from new housing developments.
The District’s long-planned modernization of its older facilities (Cherrydale, Saltar’s Point, and
Anderson Island Elementary Schools), construction of a future elementary school in DuPont,
and the addition of modular classrooms is dependent on a means of financing modernization or
new construction. The costs associated with new construction and modernization identified in
the District’s Construction Plan and anticipated state and local funding are presented in Tab 5.
The District uses an impact fee methodology that is based upon the Pierce County school
impact fee ordinance.
In this Capital Facilities Plan, based on current enrollment projections and the need to construct
a new school to meet capacity needs related to growth, the District is requesting school impact
fees.
The District’s Funding Plan identifies the specific funding sources, amounts of funding, and the
unique relationships that exist between funding sources for the projects spelled out in the
District’s Comprehensive Plan.

2.

COST FACTORS

Factors: A number of factors influence the total cost and, specifically, the local share of any
new school construction project. The major factors that impact the cost of new school
construction are as follows:
1.

The per acre cost of school sites will vary considerably from district to district. In
general, the more urban the district tends to be, the costlier the school sites.

2.

The acreage of available property and the use ability of acreage will not always match
the preferred school site sizes.

3.

The proximity of needed utilities (i.e., water, sewer, electricity, etc.) and roadways to a
new school site are oftentimes a significant cost variable.

4.

The nature of the instructional programs housed in school facilities drastically impact
the cost of those facilities. The square foot cost of senior high schools is almost always
higher than elementary and middle schools. The square footage costs of middle schools
are usually higher than elementary schools. Specialized facilities for Vocational and
Special Education programs can also increase construction costs.

2025-2030

Packet page 145 of 218

5.

The posture of the local governmental planning agencies (i.e., City or County) will affect
such items as off-site street improvements, landscaping, street signaling, and signage,
etc.

6.

The “bidding climate” at the time a new school project comes on line is terribly
important. Normally, the less construction work available the more competitive the
general contractors become and vise-versa.

7.

The experiences and competence of the lowest bidding and general contractor and their
major subcontractors can also impact the final cost of any new school project.

8.

The State’s “funding assistance percentage”, as determined in accordance with the
formula set forth in RCW 28A.525.166, establishes the relationship between the local
and state funding of any new school construction project.

9.

The enrollment projection provisions of the State’s “space allocations” determine just
how much area of a new school facility will be eligible for State School Construction
Funding Assistance. Building a new school (i.e., elementary, middle, senior high)
without full “unhoused” eligibility increases the amount of local funds that have to go
into a project.

10.

The State funding assistance formula also impacts the level of state financial assistance.
See WAC 392-343-060.

Site Acquisition: The first major expense of any new school construction project is the cost to
purchase the site. Property acquisition cannot be funded with State School Construction
Funding Assistance. Land costs are strictly a local school district expense.
In addition to the location, site size and availability to utilities, other factors can also impact the
cost of school sites. For example, the general condition of the real estate market, zoning and
the overall construction suitability of a site do influence the price.
Construction Estimates: The second major expense of any new school construction project is
the cost of actually developing the site and constructing the buildings(s). Such costs include
payment for planning, designing, engineering, constructing, furnishing, and equipping new
school facilities. In addition, at times, new portable classrooms are purchased and sited at new
schools and/or existing portable classrooms are moved to new school sites.

FUNDING SOURCES

School districts utilize budgets consisting of a number of discrete funds. However, for the most
part, the capital needs of any school system are addressed with the Capital Projects Fund and
the Debt Service Fund.
1. The Capital Projects fund is used for purposes such as: (a) to finance the purchase and
development of school sites; (b) the construction of new facilities and the
modernization of existing facilities; and (c) the purchase of initial equipment, library
books and textbooks for new facilities. Revenues accruing to the Capital Project Fund
come primarily from bond sale proceeds, capital levy collections, and state matching
funds. However, Revenues from the General Fund, the sale of property and
contributions can also be accrued to the Capital Projects Fund. School impact fees and
mitigation fees are maintained in segregated accounts.
2. The Debt Service Fund is used as a mechanism to pay for bonds. When a bond issue
passes, a school district sells bonds that have a face value and an interest rate. Local
property taxes are adjusted to provide the funds necessary to meet the approved
periodic payments on sold bonds. The proceeds from the taxes collected for this
purpose are deposited in the Debt Service Fund and drawn out for payments at the
appropriate times.
As noted earlier, school districts receive funds for capital program purposes from a variety of
sources. Those sources are described as follows:
Bonds: Bonds are financial instruments having a face value and an interest rate, which is
determined at the time and by the conditions of their sale. Bonds are backed by the “full faith
and credit” of the issuing school district and may be paid from proceeds derived from a specific
increase in the property taxes for that purpose. The increase in the taxes results in an “excess
levy” of taxes beyond the constitutional limit, so the bonds must be approved by a vote of the
people in the jurisdiction may not exceed five (5) percent of the assessed value of the property
within that jurisdiction at the time of issuance. Bonds are multi-year financial instruments,
generally issued for 10-20 years. Because of their long-lasting impact, they require both an
extraordinary plurality of votes and a specific minimum number of voters for validation. The
positive votes must equal or exceed 60 percent of the total number of voters in the school
district who cast ballots in the last general election.
Proceeds from bond sales are limited by bond covenants and must be used for the purpose(s)
for which the bonds are issued. They cannot be converted to a non-capital or operating
purpose. The life of the improvement resulting from the bonds must meet or exceed the term
of the bonds themselves.
Capital Levies: Capital Levies differ from bonds in that they do not result in the issuance of a
financial instrument and, therefore, do not affect the “bonded indebtedness” of a school
district. This method of financing is a straight increase in property tax rates to produce a voterapproved dollar amount. The amount generated from the capital levy is then available to a
SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 27 of 35
Packet page 147 of 218

district in the approved year. The actual levy rate itself is determined by dividing the number of
dollars approved by the assessed valuation of the total district at the time the taxes are set by
the County Council. While a typical period for capital levies is one or two years, they can be
approved for up to a six-year period at one election. The amounts to be collected are identified
for each year separately and the tax rates set for each individual year. Like bond issues, capital
levies must be used for the specific capital purpose(s) that they were passed. They cannot be
converted to a non-capital or operating purpose.
State Funding Assistance: The State of Washington has a Common School Construction Fund.
The State Board of Education is responsible for administration of the funds and the
establishment of matching ratios. The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI),
has determined that Steilacoom School District’s 2024 funding assistance ratio is 52.15% for
those expenses that are defined as eligible for state funding assistance. However, the District’s
planned elementary school capacity project in this six-year plan are not anticipated to qualify
for state funding.
The base to which the percent is applied is the cost of construction, as determined by the
Construction Cost Allocation. The Construction Cost Allocation is an index of construction costs
that is used by the state to hold, define, or limit their level of support. This particular
construction cost index rarely matches the actual cost of school construction in districts across
Washington State. Nevertheless, the Construction Cost Allocation for school construction costs
for July 2024 is $375.00 per square foot.
The formula for determining the amount of state matching support can be expressed as
AxBxC=D, where
A=
eligible area (determined by OSPI’s student square footage allowances)
B=
The Construction Cost Allocation (in dollars per square foot)
C=
A school district’s applicable state funding assistance rate
D=
the amount of state fiscal assistance to which a district will be entitled. Qualification for
state matching funds involves an application process. Districts may submit information for
consideration by the State Board of Education, which meets once every two months during the
year. Once approved, the district qualifies for matching funds in a sequence, which recognizes
the existing approvals of previous submittals. Failure of a school district to proceed with a
project in a timely manner can result in loss of a district’s “place in line”.
New construction projects are eligible for a state reimbursement at 100% of the Construction
Cost Allocation for matchable construction costs. In addition, state statute provides that
modernization of new-in-lieu-of replacement projects are eligible for state reimbursement at
100% of the Construction Cost Allocation.
Funds for the state match come from the Common School Construction Fund using revenues
accruing predominately from the sale of renewable resources, primarily timber, from state
school lands being set aside by the Enabling Act of 1889. If these sources are insufficient to
meet current needs, the legislature can appropriate additional funds or the Superintendent of
Public Instruction can prioritize projects for funding.
SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 28 of 35
Packet page 148 of 218

As noted in WAC 392-343-057, in the event that state matching monies are not available to
fund a specific school project, then school districts may proceed at their own financial risk. At
such time state monies do become available, reimbursement will be made to the district for the
state’s share of said project.
The District is currently not eligible for state reimbursement for new construction.
Impact Fees: According to RCW 82.02.050, the definition of an impact fee is “… a payment of
money imposed upon development as a condition of development approval to pay for public
facilities needed to serve new growth and development, and that is reasonably related to the
new development that creates additional demand and need for public facilities, that is a
proportionate share of the cost of the public facilities, and that is used for facilities that
reasonably benefit the new development. “Impact fee” does not include a reasonable permit or
application fee.”
Impact Fees can be collected where a District demonstrates an “un-housed student need” as
determined by applying the district’s level of service to projected growth from new residential
development. The amounts to be charged are calculated based on the costs for providing the
space for the projected number of students in each residential unit.
The District determines the cost per unit by using a student generation rate. The Pierce County
School Impact Fee Ordinance, Table 4A-1 of Chapter 4A.30 of the Pierce County Code, identifies
the school impact fee formula and defines the “Student Factor” as follows:
"Student Factor" is the number derived by a School District to describe how many students of
each grade span are expected to be generated by development activity. Student factors shall be
based on District records of average actual student generated rates for new developments
constructed over a period of not more than five years prior to the date of the fee calculation;
provided that, if such information is not available in the District or if there are no developments
in the District similar to that being proposed, the District may use data from districts with
similar demographics, or, if no other data sources are reasonably available, county-wide
averages.
For purposes of this year’s CFP, the District is relying on a 2024 student generation rate study
prepared by an independent consultant. The District has, in previous updates to its Capital
Facilities Plan, used student factors from nearby school districts where the sample size of
development within the District has not been adequate to produce a reliable District-specific
student factor. The District will revisit student generation rates in future updates to the Capital
Facilities Plan.

For impact fees, the District’s Board of Directors must first adopt a Capital Facilities Plan with
recommended fees and then, the towns, cities, and counties located within the District
boundaries must then adopt a school impact fee ordinance and adopt or update the District’s
recommended fee. Within the Steilacoom Historical School District, those general government
jurisdictions include the Town of Steilacoom, the City of DuPont and Pierce County.
Furthermore, developers may contribute properties which will have value to a district. In such
cases, the developer is entitled to a credit for the actual cost of the provided property. This
credit can reduce or eliminate the mitigation or impact fee that would be chargeable under the
mitigation/impact fee calculation.
The District collects school impact fees from new residential development in unincorporated
Pierce County, the Town of Steilacoom, and the City of DuPont. The District is not requesting
school impact fees from residential units with fewer than 2 bedrooms, and accessory dwelling
units (ADU) until such time that data becomes available to reasonably calculate the specific
impact from those units. The District also does not intend that school impact fees be collected
from residential units in communities that are restricted to ages 55 and over as these units
typically do not generate students to the school system.
SHSD Capital Facilities Plan
2025-2030

Page 30 of 35
Packet page 150 of 218

The Pierce County school impact fee ordinance requires that the calculated fee be discounted
by 50% and, in addition, artificially caps fees and updates the capped fee each year based upon
an escalation factor.
District impact fees are calculated for Single Family Units, Townhouses, and a composite rate
for Multi-Family Residential Units using the data provided on Enclosure 1 of this plan. The
Board of Directors has determined that the impact fee assessed for each townhouse unit will
receive a discretionary adjustment to limit the fee to be no greater than the calculated fee for
Single Family Units. This adjustment is being made until such time as the number of units
increases or the data becomes less volatile. The board retains the right to eliminate this
discretionary adjustment in future plan updates.
The Town of Steilacoom and City of DuPont generally use the District’s recommended fee as a
basis for the fee amount.
As noted above, the District utilized an independent consultant to research the student
generation rate specific to the District in 2024. The District will make decisions regarding any
future adjustment to the impact fee as the CFP is updated annually.
Enclosures 1 through 2 to this tab include the District’s 2024 impact fee calculations and data
for use in 2025.

THE DISTRICT FUNDING PLAN

The District’s Funding Plan is designed to identify the specific funding resources, the amounts of
funding needed and the unique relationships that exist between funding sources for each of the
capital projects set forth in the District’s Construction Plan. The District does not expect to
receive state matching funds for construction of the new elementary school. The District
anticipates that the new elementary school will cost approximately $48,000,000 (hard
construction costs only). The District’s voters will need to approve a bond measure to fund
construction of the new school. Impact fee revenue will also be used to fund the planning and
construction of any new school or additions to existing schools identified as growth related
projects. Impact fees may also be used to fund portable facilities needed for interim growthrelated capacity.
The District’s excess assessed value used to calculate the bond rate is $5,378,155,188 for the
2024 levy year.
Other minor sources of funding include grants, bequests, and proceeds from the sales of excess
property. They are usually a small part of the total financing package.

Steilacoom Historical School District Student Genera4on Rates
Educa&onal Data Solu&ons, LLC

April 2024
The Steilacoom Historical School District contracted with Educa&onal Data Solu&ons, LLC to do a
student-genera&on-analysis, examining how much student growth occurs with new construc&on
housing. The following provides a brief descrip&on of the methodology and the results.
The student genera&on rate analysis is conducted in a geographic informa&on system (GIS) by
overlaying geospa&al layers represen&ng residen&al units constructed within a speciﬁed
&meframe (including single family homes, new mobile home installa&ons, apartment buildings
and duplexes, townhomes and condos) and student addresses geocoded from the current year’s
enrollment ﬁle, thus establishing a spa&al rela&onship between students and new homes in the
District.
We gathered this informa&on from the following sources:
Building Permit Records
We obtained ac&ve and recently closed (construc&on completed) building permits from the local
issuing agencies including the ci&es of DuPont, Steilacoom, and Lakewood, as well as Pierce
County, which includes Anderson and Ketron Islands, as well as unincorporated por&ons of the
district between Steilacoom and Lakewood. These sources provided the majority of new
residen&al unit records in our inventory.
Pierce County Assessor Data
The County Assessor provides downloadable tables of residen&al property improvements on
parcels, which include the year built. Using these tables, we geolocated parcels in the GIS that
contain residen&al units constructed between 2012 and 2023. This informa&on was spa&ally
overlayed with the building permits in the GIS to iden&fy parcels with new residen&al
construc&on missing from the permit records.
Zonda Housing Market Research Tools
Zonda is a subscrip&on service that provides geospa&al tools for researching past, present, and
future housing construc&on projects within a proprietary database. We used Zonda to locate
new residen&al units that were not captured in our compila&on of building permits and assessor
records.

Packet page 156 of 218

Finally, we geocoded students’ home-addresses for the current school year enrollment ﬁle (SY
2023-24) to complete the update of the GIS database.
Given the pa\ern of development in the District we used diﬀerent years for the mul&-family and
single-family analysis. When we looked at mul&-family development, we found that there have
been a number of duplexes and townhomes built since 2015, but very few apartments. In order
to get a larger sample of apartment units, we expanded our focus to units that were permi\ed
between 2012 and 2021. Typically, we would not use such a long &me-span, since many of the
students from these units may have moved or graduated since these buildings were built. In this
case, however, we needed to secure permits back to 2012 to provide a suﬃciently large sample
of apartment units.
For the analysis of single-family, we used all permi\ed units that were built between 2016 and
2021. Although a number of single-family units have been built in the past two years (2022 and
2023) the recent slow-down in home sales and new home construc&on indicated that at least
some of these units may not have been sold or occupied by the &me school opened in 2023.
Between 2016 and 2021, there were 176 new single-family units constructed within the District
boundary area. Our analysis shows that the District sees an average of 26 students for every 100
single-family units that are built (Table 1).
Between 2012 and 2021 there were 419 mul&-family units built within the district boundary.
These consisted of 359 apartment units, 54 townhomes, and 6 duplex units. The District sees an
average of 17 students for every 100 mul&-family units that are built, but the rate varies
considerably by type of unit (Table 2). Townhome developments produce an average of 57
students for every 100 units, whereas apartments produce an average 12 students for every 100
units. We did not ﬁnd any students from the duplex units. When planning for the future, it’s
important to consider the diﬀerences we found among diﬀerent types of mul&-family units.

Steilacoom School District
Demographic Trends and Enrollment Projections

Prepared by
William L. (“Les”) Kendrick PhD
(Consultant)
April 2024

Packet page 159 of 218

Introduction
K-12 public school enrollment in the four-county Puget Sound region is still about
23,000 less than what it was prior to the pandemic. In the post-COVID era, overall
enrollment in Pierce County and the region continues to be relatively flat, even though
some districts are starting to see their enrollment grow again. Perhaps most surprising
is the fact that kindergarten enrollment throughout the region is still well below the
level it was at prior to the start of the pandemic. Over the past year, the percentage of
students enrolled in kindergarten (comparing enrollment to births from five years ago)
declined in all four counties.
The Steilacoom Historical District is not immune from the challenges facing other
districts in the region. The district’s enrollment is still about 300 students lower than it
was prior the pandemic, and the percentage of students enrolled in kindergarten
declined in the past year. So, what does the future look like? The purpose of the
present report and analysis is to provide a ten-year forecast by grade level for the
Steilacoom School District.

Trends and Projections – April 2024
Packet page 160 of 218

Introduction
The first part of this report provides an executive summary of our major findings and
recommendations. The second part highlights the enrollment trends we are seeing in
Steilacoom and the region. The next section highlights the demographic trends that are
most important when looking at enrollment (births, population growth, and housing).
Following this, we provide a series of alternative forecasts using different methods.
These provide some guidance for developing our preferred forecast along with a low
and high alternative. In a separate document we have also provided student generation
rates for the district, indicating how many students enroll from new construction

Executive Summary
•

Enrollment in the four-county Puget Sound region continues to trend flat. Over the
past year, there was a net loss of 209 students across all four counties. Enrollment in
the Puget Sound is still about 23,000 students less than what it was in October 2019.

•

Over the past year there was a net loss of students in King, Kitsap, and Pierce
Counties. There was a small net gain of 136 students in Snohomish County.

•

Kindergarten in all four counties is also below the level it was at prior to the start of
the pandemic. The percentage of the eligible birth cohort enrolled in kindergarten
dropped over the past year in all four counties.

•

At this point it would appear that many parents of kindergarten students are pursuing
educational options outside of the schools (home schooling, private schools, or virtual
schooling), or they are moving out of the area at a higher rate than normal.

4

Trends and Projections – April 2024
Packet page 162 of 218

Executive Summary
•

Private school enrollment in all four counties is now higher than it was back in 2018,
suggesting that the public schools may have lost market share to the private schools
over the past few years. The trends vary by district, however, so not all districts have
lost students to the private schools.

•

In Pierce County specifically, there are selected areas that are continuing to see K-12
enrollment growth in the post-pandemic years (e.g., Bethel, Sumner, White River).
Most of these areas have large amounts of new construction single family homes that
are attractive to families with children.

•

Births in King County have also dropped for the past six years and this has
implications for enrollment throughout the area. Many families with preschool age
children in King County move to the outlying counties to buy homes. Fewer births in
King County means less K-12 enrollment growth in the region.

Trends and Projections – April 2024

Executive Summary
•

The Steilacoom Historical School District is not immune from the demographic trends
impacting the region in the post-Covid era. Enrollment in the district is about 300
students lower than it was prior to the start of the pandemic. Enrollment declined over
the past year and kindergarten enrollment in October 2023 was much lower than we
might have expected based on the historical trends.

•

In order to determine what might happen in the future we need to focus on
demographic trends. First, births in Pierce County are stable but relatively flat based
on the last two years of data that are available (2021 and 2022). Births in the cities of
Steilacoom and DuPont have mostly followed the trends we are seeing throughout the
County.

•

Housing growth in the District over the past decade (2010 to 2020) was also much
lower than what we saw in the previous decade (2000 to 2010). There have been a few
townhome developments in DuPont in the past five years that have produced
enrollment gains for the District, but there were only about 500 new housing units
added to the District’s housing stock between 2015 and 2023.
6

Trends and Projections – April 2024
Packet page 164 of 218

Executive Summary
•

Housing trends may be starting to change, however, with the announcement of a new
development in the city of DuPont. Although this development is still in the preplanning phase, it is expected to add a mix of single family houses, apartments, and
other multi-family units, potentially adding 3,000 units to the District’s housing stock.

•

Based on an examination of the plans and discussion with district personnel, it appears
that approximately 1,000 apartment units could start impacting enrollment in late
2025 through 2027, followed by the addition of about 400 single family units, and
approximately 1,500 multi-family units of various kinds by the end of the decade.

•

Although there are indications that the development might be finished by 2030, our
past experience with projects of this size suggests that it could take up to ten years for
the project to be completed. Even if it is completed sooner, not all the students in
these homes are likely to enroll immediately. Families with preschool-age children,
for example, may move in several years before there students are eligible for school.

7

Trends and Projections – April 2024
Packet page 165 of 218

Executive Summary
•

To help us create a ten-year forecast of the District’s enrollment we have used
multiple methods. The average of different methods is often a better predictor of
future enrollment than any single method.* We used the average of these methods as a
check on our main forecast, to ensure that it closely aligns with this average.

•

Our main forecast uses cohort survival, which looks at the net change in enrollment by
grade that occurs as students move from one grade to the next over the course of a
year. For example, it compares the second grade enrollment in October 2023 to the
first grade enrollment in October 2022 to determine if enrollment increased or
decreased. If we divide the second grade enrollment by last year’s first grade
enrollment you get a ratio which summarizes the enrollment changes. A ratio greater
than one indicates that more students moved in than moved out. A ratio less than one
indicates that more students moved out than moved in.

•

At kindergarten, we compare the enrollment in a given year to birth five years prior to
that year to create a birth-to-k ratio. This ratio helps us understand the enrollment
patterns and trends at kindergarten over time.
8

Trends and Projections – April 2024
Packet page 166 of 218

Executive Summary
•

These ratios can be averaged over several years to get a sense of the district’s
kindergarten market share (relative to births) and a sense of how much gain or loss the
district sees as student progress from one grade to the next.

•

Assuming demographic trends do not change, the cohort survival method can produce
a reasonably good estimate of future enrollments. But if demographic conditions shift,
for example, if there is a massive increase in population growth, or a sharp decline in
new housing development, this type of forecast can produce larger than expected
errors.

•

In our forecast for the District we had to account for the projected increase in housing
that we expect from the DuPont project, and we had to consider if housing in the rest
of the district would be similar to past history.

9

Trends and Projections – April 2024
Packet page 167 of 218

Executive Summary
•

Our preferred forecast assumes that approximately 3,100 new housing units will be
added to the District’s housing stock between 2024 and 2033 (some from the Dupont
project and a scattering of developments from other areas). We adjusted the results we
got from our cohort forecast to account for the growth we expect from these new
homes.

•

These adjustments were based on our analysis of student generation rates, which show
how many students enroll from new homes. Our analysis showed that district sees
about 17 students for every 100 multi-family units added to the housing stock.
However, this rate varies by the type of unit. Townhomes, for example, produce a
much higher rate of growth than apartments with 54 students per 100 units.

•

For single family homes our analysis showed that the district sees about 26 students
for every 100 new units built. Our experience, however, suggests that large
developments of 100 homes more typically produce higher numbers of students than
small scattered developments throughout the district boundary area. The latter has
been the development pattern over the past decade.
10

Trends and Projections – April 2024
Packet page 168 of 218

Executive Summary
•

Our preferred forecast assumes that the district may see relatively flat or declining
enrollment over the next two years, with very little new housing development. After
that time, we expect enrollment to start growing steadily, driven by an expected
recovery in the real estate market and the commencement of the DuPont project.

•

Given the relatively low student generation rates from apartments, and the fact that the
DuPont development is expected to begin with apartments, we do not expect a
significant growth trend in the first few years of development. As more single-family
and townhomes units are added, we would expect better growth, similar to what the
district saw in some of the years leading up to the pandemic.

•

Given that the DuPont project is not yet fully specified in terms of timing and type of
units, we cannot be certain about the impact on enrollment. However, our preferred
forecast is close to the average of other methods we used to predict enrollment (see
page 44). This lends some confidence to our estimate, but it is important to keep in
mind that all forecasts must make assumptions about demographic trends (births,
population, and housing) based on the best information available at the time.
11

Trends and Projections – April 2024
Packet page 169 of 218

Executive Summary
•

Given the uncertainty we encounter when predicting the future we also created low
and high alternatives to our main forecast. These alternatives show what might happen
if kindergarten growth and growth at the continuing grades were to be lower or higher
than what we have assumed in our preferred medium-range forecast.

•

At kindergarten, we assumed that market share would be about five percent lower or
higher. At the continuing grades we assumed that the enrollment would be about twopercent lower or higher based on our past experience with error ranges for a district
the size of Steilacoom.

•

As always, we recommend that these forecasts be updated periodically to take
advantage of new enrollment and demographic information.

Enrollment Trends
Key Points and Highlights
•

Enrollment in the Steilacoom School District continues to trend below the level it was at prior
to the start of the pandemic.

•

The District is not alone in this regard. Enrollment in the four-county Puget Sound region is
about 23,000 students lower than it was prior to the pandemic. Over the past year, there was a
net loss of 209 students in the four-county region, with declines in King, Kitsap, and Pierce
counties, and a small net gain in Snohomish County.

•

Kindergarten enrollment in all four counties of the Puget Sound is still well below where it was
prior to the start of the pandemic. The percentage of eligible students enrolled in kindergarten
dropped in all four counties compared to last year.

•

The District’s share of the County K-12 population has dropped some since the pandemic. This
is not surprising, as there are several districts in the region (e.g., Bethel, Sumner, and White
River) where enrollment is now higher than it was prior to the start of the pandemic. Most of
these Districts are seeing significant development of new single family housing.

Birth Trends
Key Points and Highlights
•

Births in Piece County have remained at about the same level for the past three years for which
we have data (2020, 2021, and 2022).

•

Our updated forecast of births in Pierce County is about the same as last year’s. We expect births
to remain relatively flat over the course of the forecast period.

•

Births have been declining in King County since 2016. Women in King County are having fewer
children and waiting longer to start their families. This can have implications for the wider
county since many families with preschool age children often move to the outlying counties to
find more affordable housing.

•

The percentage of students enrolled in kindergarten has dropped in all four counties of the Puget
Sound since the pandemic.

•

We expect the percentage of students enrolled in Steilacoom kindergarten classes to rise
gradually over time as more housing is added to the District’s housing stock (see the next
section). For the next couple of years, however, we expect this percentage to remain below the
historical averages we were seeing prior to the pandemic.

Housing and Population Trends
Key Points and Highlights
•

Home Sales in the Steilacoom School District dropped between 2007 and 2012 when the housing
bubble burst and sales and prices began to decline throughout the Puget Sound. Home sales
began to trend up in the District and the region between 2013 and 2019, as lower prices and low
mortgage interest rates attracted more buyers. In the past two years, however, home sales have
started to decline again due to higher prices and higher mortgage interest rates.

•

Our assumption is that home sales will remain relatively modest in 2024 and perhaps start to
recover and trend up in 2025, once there is some adjustment to the real estate market (e.g., a
decline in interest rates and/or prices). Fewer homes turning over means fewer opportunities for
families with children to buy homes in the district boundary area.

•

There were fewer new homes added to the District’s housing stock between 2010 and 2020 than
in the previous decade (2000 to 2010), according to Census data.

•

Between 2012 and 2021 there were 419 multi-family permits issued within the District boundary
area. Our analysis showed that these units produced an average of 17 students for every 100
units. They also showed that townhomes generate more new students than apartments. Singlefamily homes permitted between 2016 and 2021 generated an average of 26 students for every
100 units. The full student generation rate analysis is presented in a separate report.

Housing and Population Trends
Key Points and Highlights
•

Our preferred housing forecast assumes that the District will see a substantial number of new
housing units added over the next decade. Most of this is due to a project in the City of DuPont
which is expected to add about 3,000 units between 2025 and 2035. Based on our examination of
this data and correspondence with District personnel, we believe it will take about a decade for
thee units to be fully completed and occupied and that construction is not likely to start until late
2025 or 2026. We have also assumed some development in the City of Steilacoom and other
areas of the District based on past trends.

•

We also created a lower housing forecast that assumes about half-as much development will
occur over the next decade. This forecast assumes that the project in DuPont may take longer to
develop or that plans may change resulting in a lower number of units. This lower forecast is
consistent with housing forecasts for the DuPont and Steilacoom area available from the Puget
Sound Regional Council, a local planning agency.

•

The two housing forecasts are shown on page 36. Our preferred forecast assumes that most of
the development in DuPont will not start until 2025-2026, and that the initial phases will focus
on apartments, followed by some single-family development in the mid-part of the forecast. The
final phase will entail the development of specialized multi-family units, which could include
condos, duplexes, triplexes, or townhomes.

Housing and Population Trends
Key Points and Highlights
•

We also created two population forecasts that are based on our two housing forecasts. Our
preferred population forecast, based off of our preferred housing forecast, assumes that the
District will increase its share of the County population as more new housing is added. As the
District’s share of the County population increases, so too does its share of the County K-12
population. We can use this relationship as one method for predicting future enrollment. The
results of this and other methods for forecasting enrollment are show in the next section of our
report.

•

Another method for predicting enrollment is to use a housing yield forecast. This method looks
at the number of students per house in the District (this includes all housing, new and existing)
and uses this number, applied to future housing forecasts, to estimate enrollment in the future.

•

The District currently has about 31 students for every 100 housing units in the District. The
number of students per house declined between 2010 and 2020 and has continued to drop in the
past few years partly due to the pandemic. It is likely that this trend will continue, at least for the
next several years, if not longer, due to the flat birth trends. We produced a housing yield
forecast on page 41, using our preferred housing forecast and based on the assumption that the
number of students per house will continue to drop based on recent trends. This is another
method for predicting future enrollment (see the next section).

Housing and Population Trends
Key Points and Highlights
•

It is also possible that the number of students per house will start to stabilize as we get close to
2030, as more new housing brings more new students into the District. The chart on page 42
shows a second housing yield forecast that indicates what enrollment might look like if the
number of students per house stabilized at around 30 students per 100 units, by 2030.

•

These results and other methods for predicting enrollment are discussed in the next section of
this report. These various methods provide a guide to help us see where enrollment might land in
the future.

Multi-Family
Note: We used permits from 2012 to 2021 to do this analysis (a ten year timespan). Although we typically use a shorter time-span, so as not to
miss students who might graduate or leave after a few years, we expanded the range in order to create a large enough sample for different unit
types. Most of the apartment units in this sample were built between 2012 and 2015.

Alternative Forecast Methods

Packet page 201 of 218

Alternative Forecast Methods
General wisdom and research suggest that the average of several different forecasts is often better than a single
forecast*. Keeping this in mind we created several alternative forecast models to guide us in developing our final
model:
•
Population and Births: This is a simple model that uses a forecast of the District population and County
births to predict the total enrollment. This model does not break the enrollment out by grade level.
•

Cohort Survival Forecast: These models show what might happen if enrollment trends were similar to the
trends we saw during certain historical time periods. We created three different cohort forecasts. The first two
extrapolate the trends into the future using the average rates we saw in the six years prior to COVID (20142019) and in the three years prior to COVID (2017-2019). The third forecast trends enrollment into the future
using the averages of the past ten years (2014 to 2023).

•

Housing Yield Forecasts: Here we take our preferred housing forecast and use an estimate of the number of
students per house we might expect over time. This includes ALL housing, both new and existing. The low
estimate assumes about 28 students per 100 units by 2033 and the high estimate assumes about 30 students per
100 units by 2033. This analysis was presented in the previous section on housing.

•

Market Share: As the District’s share of the County population goes up so too does its share of the County K12 population. We used this correlation, along with our preferred District population forecast and our forecast
of the County K-12 population to predict enrollment in the future.

* See for example, John Armstrong (2001) Combining forecasts: A review and annotated bibliography. International Journal of Forecasting, (5), 559-583.

Alternative Projections
As can be seen below, these models show different forecast outcomes depending on what factors we
consider and variation in those factors. Given the uncertainty that attends all forecasts, the average of
our alternative forecasts provides a useful guide for our final forecast by grade level which is based
on grade level enrollment trends, births, and the growth we expect from new home construction. Our
final forecast will be close to but different from the average presented here because it considers grade
level trends, and the size of each year’s incoming kindergarten and outgoing graduating class. It
should, however, be reasonably close to this average (within about 100 students).

Final Forecasts by Grade
Methodology and Results

Packet page 205 of 218

Methodology for the Main Forecast
The preferred forecast in this report is based on birth counts, birth forecasts, grade level
enrollment trends, and assumptions about the number of students likely to be added from new
home construction over time. We used a cohort survival model with adjustments for new
housing construction. Our preferred medium range forecast uses our preferred housing forecast
to estimate how many students might be generated from new home construction. The
following provides a discussion of the methods used to create this forecast.
Births and Birth Forecasts
We used Pierce County births to project Kindergarten along with the number of births that
have occurred in the cities of Steilacoom and DuPont. The number of county births is known
through 2022 which means that we can predict Kindergarten enrollment based on actual births
out to 2027. Beyond that point, births were projected based on the most recent fertility rates for
the county and the forecast of the number of women likely to reach their childbearing years
over time using the medium range county forecast from the State of Washington. We assumed
that the number of births in the cities would approximate the age-specific birth trends we are
projecting for the County.

Methodology for the Main Forecasts
Projecting Kindergarten Enrollment
Kindergarten enrollment was projected using birth-to-k ratios. The birth-to-k ratio
compares the kindergarten enrollment by year to births five years prior to that year.
Our forecast assumes it will continue to rise over time consistent with the continued
increases in population and housing within the District boundary area.
The baseline for our forecast used the average birth-to-k ratio for the past three years.
Our forecast assumes the district’s share of the birth cohort will remain right around
this average over the next two years and rise gradually as new housing is added to the
District’s housing stock. To estimate the amount of kindergarten growth from new
housing we used the student generation rate data showing how many kindergarten
students might come from specific types of housing.

Methodology for the Main Forecasts
Projecting Grades 1-12
The forecast at grades 1-12 was based on grade level cohort rates which predict the net
gain and/or loss in enrollment as students progress from one grade to the next. Cohort
rates are calculated by dividing the enrollment at a specific grade (e.g., 2nd grade) by the
enrollment at the previous grade (e.g., 1st grade) in the previous academic year, to create
a ratio. A ratio greater than one means that more families moved in than moved out over
the course of the year. A ratio less than one means more families moved out than moved
in. Ratios can be averaged over several years to create an average rate of change for each
grade. The enrollment history on page 52 shows cohort ratios and birth-to-k ratios for
different time periods.
For this analysis, we used a six-year average for the continuing grades so we could
capture both low and high growth years, giving us a better sense of the average amount
of growth the District sees at each grade (not the extreme highs we see in some years due
to new housing or due to recovery from Covid, nor the extreme lows we saw during 2020
due to the pandemic). The six-year average captures our best estimate of the middle
growth point, prior to considering the impact of new housing.

Methodology for the Main Forecasts
Adding Students from New Housing
After completing the initial forecast we added the students we expect from new housing
in the future using our preferred housing forecast and the District’s student generation
rates (see page 31). Our medium-range forecast represents our best estimate of the
future enrollment for now. It is closely aligns with the average of the alternative forecast
methods we presented in the previous section (within about 100 students or less in most
years).
Low and High Alternatives
We also created low and high alternative forecasts which show what might happen if
grades 1-12 growth were to be about two-percent higher or lower on an annual basis,
and kindergarten growth about half-a-percent lower or higher on an annual basis. We
typically use a one-percent range at the continuing grades for medium to large sized
districts (the acceptable error rate for a one-year forecast in a medium to large-sized
district), but used a higher range for Steilacoom because error rates are usually higher
when working with smaller-sized districts.
The following pages show the medium preferred forecast by grade level along with the
low and high alternatives. As always, we recommend that these forecasts be updated
periodically to take advantage of new demographic and enrollment information.

Policy 5161 Civility in the Workplace
Strategic Focus Area
☐ Achieve
☒ Support
☐ Connect
☐ Plan
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Policy 5161 – Civility in the Workplace - was established by the Washington State School Directors
Association (WSSDA) as a model policy. Policy 5161 has been adopted by many school districts
around Washington State, as recommended by WSSDA.
At the Board’s most recent work session, the Board expressed an interest in implementation of a
civility policy, so staff researched the model policy series and is presenting this to you today for
consideration. The intent of the policy is to prioritize an environment that is safe, civil, and
grounded in both orderly conduct and mutual respect, to contribute to a quality educational
environment for students.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
It is the recommendation of the Superintendent to move Policy 5161 to a 2nd Reading.

Report prepared by:
Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

Policy No. 5161
Personnel

CIVILITY IN THE WORKPLACE
The Steilacoom Historical School District board believes that a safe, civil environment of mutual
respect and orderly conduct contributes to a quality educational environment. Conversely,
uncivil conduct, similar to other forms of disruptive behavior, may interfere with an employee’s
ability to accomplish their work and a school’s ability to educate its students.
The board of directors commits the district in its entirety to the core value of mutual respect for
each person regardless of individual differences or characteristics. The district expects this value
to be manifested in the daily behavior of all constituents. When differences exist, stakeholders
will use clear, concise, and courteous communication with the goal of arriving at a goodwill
solution. Uncivil conduct on district property or at district-sponsored activities by school
directors, staff, parents, volunteers, contractors, or visitors is prohibited.
Expectations of Stakeholders (Board of Directors, Employees, Parents, Volunteers, Contractors,
and Visitors)
In support of this policy, the board of directors expects its members and all stakeholders to:
• Treat each other and students with dignity and respect;
• Exercise reasonable, good judgment in handling interpersonal disputes;
• Exercise respect, courtesy, and concern for the dignity and cultural background of others;
• Refrain from use of abusive language;
• Model respectful problem-solving;
• Reduce actions or behaviors that might provoke fear, anger, frustration, or alienation;
• Use clear, concise, and courteous oral and written communication to arrive at goodwill
solutions;
• Extend common courtesy to others such as saying please and thank you;
• Practice civility in all conversations and behavior;
• Be respectful of others even when in a disagreement;
• Address incivility when it is observed; and
• Seek to understand others’ points of view and cultural perceptions.
Definition of Uncivil Conduct
For the purposes of this policy, “uncivil conduct” includes but is not limited to, the following:
• Using vulgar, obscene or profane gestures or words;
• Using insulting or disrespectful nonverbal behaviors toward or in connection with
another;
• Taunting, jeering, or inciting others to taunt or jeer an individual;
• Raising one’s voice at another individual, and/or repeatedly interrupting another
individual who is speaking;
• Using personal epithets or slurs,
• Gesturing or behaving in a manner that puts another in fear for his/her personal safety,
including invading the personal space of an individual after being directed to move away,
physically blocking an individual’s exit from a room or location, or remaining in a

Personnel
classroom or school area after a teacher or administrator in authority has directed one to
leave, or other similar disruptive conduct.
“Uncivil conduct” does not include the expression of controversial or differing viewpoints that
may be offensive to some persons, so long as (1) the ideas are presented in a respectful manner
and at a time and place that are appropriate, and (2) such expression does not materially disrupt,
and may not be reasonably anticipated to disrupt, the educational process. Nor does “uncivil
conduct” include regular supervisory-subordinate interactions, including but not limited to,
corrective action, discipline, unsatisfactory evaluations, plans for improvement, or probation.
Addressing Uncivil Conduct
Stakeholders are expected to:
• Calmly and politely caution or warn any speaker who is engaged in uncivil conduct. If
the conduct does not cease, politely end the conversation;
• Attempt to resolve differences with another employee first in a private conversation. If
that is not feasible or successful, request an appropriate administrator to conduct a private
conference with all parties of concern;
• Resolve personal complaints or grievances with a supervisor’s decision or action by
requesting a problem-solving conference with the supervisor or with the administrator’s
supervisor.
• Persons who observe or experience uncivil behavior have an obligation to intervene,
share their reflection with the offender about the impact of that behavior, or report the
uncivil behavior to a supervisor.
• Supervisors have an obligation to address reports of uncivil behavior.
Employees who engage in uncivil behavior may be subject to corrective action or discipline.
Retaliation for reporting allegations will result in discipline.
