## 2024-03-11 - HIGHLAND_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Highland School District #203 convened a Special Board Meeting on March 11, 2024, where several key topics were discussed. The board addressed misinformation regarding staffing changes and moved forward with the 1st reading of new/revised policies to a 2nd reading. The district recognized Education Support Professionals Week and acknowledged the contributions of classified staff. A significant concern raised was the discontinuation of the 21st Century Program due to funding loss, which could lead to student transfers if after-school care is unavailable. The board directed district officials to research alternative after-school programs. 

Additionally, the 2024-2025 budget was discussed, revealing an anticipated shortfall that necessitated not renewing some provisional staff and implementing a reduction in force (RIF) for the high school CTE business position. The meeting also covered enrollment trends, noting a decline in student numbers and the potential consolidation of grades into a single building for Pre-K-5. The board reviewed the budget status, highlighting the impact of decreased enrollment and the need for budget cuts to maintain fiscal responsibility.
