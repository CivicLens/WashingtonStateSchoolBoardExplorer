To: Board of Directors
From: Greg Baker
Subject: State Budget Deficit and Impact on Bellingham Public Schools
Throughout this school year, we have been sharing class size and other budget information with staff and our community as part of my Entry
Plan and the Budget Development Process to help us establish priorities and plan for next school year.
During the past two years, as the state Legislature has cut funding for schools, our staff has worked to balance our budget by making several
million dollars in reductions. As you know, Washington state continues to face a multi-billion dollar deficit and we are once again
anticipating reduced funding. Until the Legislature adopts a budget later this spring, we will not know the exact amount of reductions that we
need to make. In both the Governors and House versions of the proposed budgets, more than $2 million in state Initiative 728 and K-4
fundsthat we are currently using to hire teachers to reduce class size would be eliminated.
In anticipation of state funding cuts, we plan to use approximately half of our temporary supplemental levy to reduce some of the impact of
state budget cuts on our class sizes for next year. We are extremely grateful to voters who supported our supplemental levy in November
2010. Without our supplemental levy, we could expect average class size increases for next school year of about three to four students per
class, equating to a loss of approximately 30 full-time equivalent (FTE) teaching positions.
Thanks to our communitys strong support of the temporary supplemental levy, we anticipate being able to reduce this impact by about half
with average class size increases of about two students per class.

The attached memo outlines the current projections for a reduced educational program. Last spring, the district sent 121 preliminary notices to
staff. We estimate that we will have to send about 60 preliminary notices to staff later this week. We will be working over the next several
weeks to place as many staff in positions for the 201112 school year as possible. Actual reductions of staff will beoffset by the
implementation of full-time kindergarten, implementation of the elementary program, and by any additional retirements, resignations and
leaves of absence.
