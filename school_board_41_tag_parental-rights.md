The Bremerton School District Board of Directors held a regular meeting on April 11, 2024, where they recognized the Month of the Military Child and Volunteer Appreciation Month, highlighting the importance of community engagement and support for military-connected families. The board approved several resolutions, including Resolution 2023/2024-16, which honors military-connected children, and Resolution 2023/2024-17, proclaiming April 2024 as Volunteer Appreciation Month. Director Bolton discussed Initiative 2181 on Parental Rights, noting that the decision to bring it in-house was made because much of its content was already being implemented. The board also received updates on the Mountain View Middle School Sports Complex Project, which is on track for completion in August 2024, and the status of the district's general fund, which is currently under $10 million but expected to improve with upcoming levy funds. Additionally, the board addressed the importance of safety in schools, with discussions on the role of volunteers in creating welcoming environments for students.
