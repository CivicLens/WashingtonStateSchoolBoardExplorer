2.2 Resolution 13-18, Bond Issuance and Sale

Meeting :

Jun 20, 2018 - Regular Board Meeting with
Executive Session

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached Resolution 13-18 authorizing
the sale of bonds later this year. As noted below, this is a
"delegation resolution." As superintendent, I have reviewed
and fully support board adoption of this resolution.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
The attached resolution 13-18 authorizes the issuance and sale of unlimited tax general obligation bonds of the District in the aggregate
principal amount of not to exceed $50,000,000 to provide funds for the renovation, upgrade and new construction of school facilities of the
District, as authorized by Resolution No.25-17 of the Board, and approved by the qualified electors of the District at a special election held
therein on February13, 2018, providing for annual tax levies to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds; and it delegatesto the
Superintendent of the District the authority to determine the structure of the bonds, approve the interest rates, maturity dates and principal
maturities for the bonds under the terms and conditions set forth herein.
A'delegation resolution' grants temporaryauthority to the Superintendent to approve the final structure and interest rates associated with the
bonds and to execute the sale of bonds. The advantage of a delegation resolution is that it allows the district to quickly enter the bond
market when conditions are favorable, irrespective of the timing of a board meeting, within the bounds of the parameters established in the
resolution. Without a delegation resolution, the district's only option is to enter the bond market on the date of a regular or special board

meeting which may or may not be a date that is most advantageous to the district. You will notice several blanks throughout the document
related to the form of bonds and exhibits. These are provisions that will be determined as we get closer to the sale date. We will provide the
board with a report describing the final terms after the bonds are sold.
