E. ASSOCIATION AND PUBLIC
COMMENT

Type :

Information

Public Content
Summary:
The Northshore School District Board of Directors has set aside a period of up to 60 minutes to receive
updates and comments fromDistrictassociation leaders and community members.As referenced in
multiple policies adopted by The Board, we expect all parties addressing the Board to present their
comments in a way that is civil and respectful. This means that whether we are school directors, district
staff, students, members of the community, or some other guest, we must all follow the same standard of
civility during school board meetings. Please speak directly to the Board and address matters related to
district operations, policies, procedures, and agenda items under consideration by the Board.
Washington State law requires that the Board limit its business and discussionat the Board meetingto onlythoseitems that have been
captured in the previously published agenda. What that means for us today:
Any public comment regarding itemsthat are includedin the published agenda will be taken into consideration by the Board when the
topic is addressed during the agenda.
Any topics brought up during public comment that are notincludedin the published agenda cannot, by law, be discussed at this
meeting and so will not be addressed or receive a response during the meeting.
In either case, depending on the nature ofyourtopic or questions,a district employee or a board member will follow up onany comments that
relate to district business.Please note that the boards silence during public comment is neutral. It is neither a signal of agreement nor
disagreement with the speakers remarks.
Also please note that comments should not make referenceto any employee or representative of the Districtby name or by identifiable
reference.If you are interested in makingcomments or complaints regardingan individual, you may use thecomplaint process available
through the Office of the Superintendent.

Finally, please remember that your words have impact and you, not the school district, are responsible for your words. We caution all
speakers that it is possible that your statements could violate the rights of others under various laws, including laws protecting privacy and
laws prohibiting defamation. If you are unsure of the legal effect of your remarks, you should seek independent legal advice. In any case, we
ask that you help us model for our students what a respectful and inclusive community looks and sounds like.
