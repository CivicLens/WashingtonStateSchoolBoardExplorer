2. Good News
Nine high schoolers from Lynden Academy participated in the homecoming dance at Lynden High School. There is an
intentional effort being made by Lynden Academy Student Leadership to ensure that all students are made aware of activities
happening at the high school so that Lynden Academy students have the option to participate.
Lynden Middle School celebrated the opening of their Lion Pride store. Students are able to purchase a variety of items and
privileges with their Lion Pride tickets that can be earned during the school day.
October is National Principals Month. Lynden School District is blessed with 9 principals who are exceptional leaders. Their
tireless efforts have a positive impact on our school community and I am grateful to be serving alongside them all.
