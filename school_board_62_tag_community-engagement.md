This document details the Bellingham School Board's monitoring response to policy EL-9.1, "Facility Improvement or Development Involving Bond Measure Proposal." The board commends the superintendent for robust long-term facilities planning that incorporates diverse community voices and aligns with the district's commitment to equity as outlined in "The Bellingham Promise."  

The board recommends deleting the first line of section 1 of the EL-9.1 policy, which mandated informing the board about the formation of a facilities and bond planning task force through the consent agenda. This change suggests a desire for more transparent and direct communication regarding bond proposals. The document also highlights the superintendent's success in seeking balanced input from staff, parents, and community stakeholders during the planning process.
