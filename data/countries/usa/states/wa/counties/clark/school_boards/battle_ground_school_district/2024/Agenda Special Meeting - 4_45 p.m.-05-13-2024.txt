Background:
On March 28, 2022, the Board approved an interagency Agreement (IA) with the Washington State Department of Energy
Services (attached as Exhibit A). That allows BGPS to utilize Services and Contractors approved by the State to assist in
energy savings programs. BGPS has utilized this IA many times over the past years.
In May of 2019, the WA Clean Building Act (HB 1257, 2019) was signed into law. Part of this law requires the development and
implementation of the Clean Buildings Standard (CBS) (WAC 194-50).

The objective of the CBS is to reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency and performance in existing
commercial or public buildings.
The first step to comply with the CBS is to identify the Energy Use Intensity (EUI) score per building and confirm the EUI is
below the expected EUI target provided by the State. The District is required to populate ENERGYSTAR portfolio manager
with buildings and EUI scores to be used as the reporting tool to the State. A portion of this proposal is to establish the
baseline of our building energy efficiency. This portion of the work will cost $49,816.
During the next six months, Ameresco will identify the path toward compliance per building and create an Energy Management
Plan for our buildings that will guide the implementation of energy savings measures over the next several years. There are
three phases of compliance dates of the CBS based on building size. Our only building included in Phase 1 is BGHS. This
portion of work at BGHS is
$42,404.
In addition, as outlined in our Capital Levy we will be replacing all or most of the fluorescent lighting in our buildings and
upgrading to LED lighting. LED is far superior in energy use as well as aesthetics.
Fluorescent lights and Natural Gas are being phased out in the State of Washington. This portion of the work will cost
$65,559.
Lastly, we will be bundling many of our projects from the recently approved Capital Levy into this potentially larger ESCO
project with Ameresco. That will be outlined at a later date.
