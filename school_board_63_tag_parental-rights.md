The Blaine School District No. 503 Regular Board Meeting on March 25, 2024, addressed several topics, including recent appointments to the Board of Directors and public comments regarding budget management and staffing impacts. President Cliff Freeman raised concerns about legislative bills SB5462 and HB2331, which mandate specific curriculum topics, including LGBTQ issues, and allow the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) to withhold funding for noncompliance. He emphasized the potential loss of local control over school district policies.
