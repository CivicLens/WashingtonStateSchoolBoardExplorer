  MINUTES OF THE BUSINESS MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
SELAH SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 119
DISTRICT OFFICE BOARD ROOM
June 27, 2024
  Members present
Dan Peters, Jamie Morford, Joe Catron, Sarah Michael, and Derek Iverson.
  1. Welcome
A. Call Meeting to Order, Roll Call & Flag Salute
The meeting was advertised in accordance with law. President Dan Peters called the meeting to order at 4:30 p.m. and led the flag salute.
  2. Suggestions/Comments From the Audience
A. District Guidelines for Public Comment
Dan stated the guidelines and asked Alicia to cover the committee’s recent work before opening comments.

Alicia gave updates to the Since Time Immemorial curriculum updates since the last meeting. She gave the timeline over the past three years. There were convenings between the Yakama and neighboring districts. The work continued heavily this year to understand the requirements and the Yakama Nation. The educators also learned quite a bit over the year and met monthly. Current social studies curriculum was reviewed to see how it fits. It is historical and future Native perspective. The Yakama Nation gave us 3 resources that they were recommending. Uniqueness for the students we serve was also a consideration. After each meeting, Alicia would update the board and the Yakama Nation with each step in the process. This is a supplemental add-on curriculum to add into our current materials. We had a viewing all day on 5/7, where no one attended. The IMC reviewed the process and approved it. It was brought to the board in May. Two individuals had opposition at that meeting and the board tabled the decision until June. I informed the committee and the Yakama Nation. She inquired whether this has happened in other districts, but it has not. She informed Henry Strom and asked how to proceed further. The board was informed and the process was transparent. Since the May meeting, we have reviewed the correspondence for and against and worked with Dr. Washines to ensure that we address those issues. We also reviewed the board meeting to ensure we could make changes requested. 1-we need to have the community able to view documents. both were done on 6/14 and 6/25. 10 total attended. We also posted the materials online. 2-we need to have a stamp of approval from the Yakama Nation. They are working with the Yakama Nation and using the materials they have provided for us. 3-we are not adopting a social studies curriculum, so we aren't required to do this. We aren't adopting a social studies curriculum. We had to review all the materials, so by law with the law, we have to adopt a STI curriculum. The Native perspective is the required change. We already had the other perspective in our history books. It doesn't change history, just provides another perspective to our current books. We want to encourage students to think critically.

Changes done based upon community feedback include:
Indigenous Peoples of the United States was a teacher resource only with the purpose of the book to give teachers to give them a different perspective. therefore, this book was replaced by a Virginia Beavert autobiography. This is a teacher resource replacement.

Keepunumuk Weeachumun - the legends and stories of those who met with the pilgrims for Kindergarteners. It is a legend. It goes into detail about how the settlers wouldn't have survived if they didn't learn how to work the land. The focus for this book was that Thanksgiving was a day of mourning. It doesn't say not to have gratitude or honor Thanksgiving. It provides the language and pronunciation of words. We have decided to keep this book.

The committee was brought back before the 3rd viewing to make this decision. The only change was bringing in Virginia Beavert's autobiography and removing the Indigenous People of the United States.

Kevin explained the legislation and requirements for Since Time Immemorial. Around our community, the legality in regards to STI, there is not clarification. I provided just a small response to a board member’s question last month, which didn’t give the entirety of details and for that, he apologizes. In hindsight, I should have responded with the RCW information. As superintendent, I take full responsibility for not fully responding regarding this information, so that the board would have full information it neede. Porter Foster and Rorick, our attorneys, summarize our legal obligation to adopt STI curriculum. To incorporate curriculum into current curriculum, and there is a mandate to adopt this in some form. Our attorney recommends immediate adoption for compliance. Copies of the attorney’s recommendation are provided for the public.
  The public was given 1 hour of time for public comment, which began at 5:01 p.m.

Norma Smith - spoke regarding the schools and was a former educator at Agapeland. She has seen so many generations, served on the school board and had their ups and downs, but discussions and community voice is a plus-plus situation. Thank you. The best school district in the world. This is the place you need to be. All my children had successful lives. Shocked to see the list of 'do not teach' list. There's a lot of history that no one likes and things were not nice for Indian or white or others. We have to take that into consideration. The board is sharp enough. The pool vote is August and everyone should vote, as we've lost 4 other times.

Laurie Berreman - Selah resident and former teacher, and mother. Support the adoption and thanks to the committee for their review, research and collaboration of the Yakama Nation. There were many issues with our history with those that some consider 'lesser than'. I appreciate that the information is providing everyone with the facts. We don't want to manipulate perspective. I am disheartened with our community. There is a lot of items being politicized due to a few vocal people in our community. We need to focus what we are FOR. I would like to see everyone successful, safe and equal access to knowledge.

Mary Schuler - guardian of her two grandchildren, and has two nieces and 5 grandchildren in the district. She is a volunteer at 4 schools and is tired of the indoctrination. the community needs to get involved. The porn books exist with 2 at the middle school and 10 at the high school. 4/14/2024 a public comment was sent to the school board by Brenda Beck and she's my other grandchildren's grandmother and they came home and told me that in JCP to not say anything if they see anything when in the bathroom. I volunteered at JCP and saw high schoolers and commented that two students who were helping that one was transgender. I asked a principal where they go to the bathroom. They stated that it was going to be a safe space of where to go to the bathrooms.

Corey Gibson - appreciated Alicia's update, appreciates allowing for editing of the materials. why is the community so disturbed by this? We have seen the youth in our community over the past years to rebel. Our current books need to do a better job at telling the whole story. The community is getting involved is a win. The book that was removed was told in a dark and hateful spirit. There are other resources. Thank you. this has been a very successful venture at seeing the community get involved. The American exceptionalism is defined as what we aspire to be. We aspire to do better every single year. We got there and are continuing to get there. Thank you.

Don Cline - pastor of the baptist church, stated thanks for attending and is concerned with the access to the curriculum and library books. You can tell a lot about an author by learning about them. I have a book. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz is an activist and was involved in a progressive women's movement and promoted separatist feminism. History must be written in and be objective in an honest way. I’m a veteran and to suggest that the 4th of July should be a day of regret says a lot about this author. And this is all we need to know about this lady. This biased book isn't going to be here, but that it was being considered. This is the greatest country on the planet. I have Native American in myself.

Russell Carlson - respected the seats of the board and their decision. has an issue with the content of the book and I don't want to talk to the Yakama Nation in 4 years and having them asking why we're using it. I want something physical from the Nation. He read a letter from Jeremie Dufault, father, former legislator and attorney, that corrected the statements of superintendent McKay that STI is required by law.  That is false. HB 1332 last year failed to make it mandatory.  RCW 28A.320.170 requires only STI when reviewing or adopting a curriculum, which Alicia stated last month is not happening.  I oppose it for a few reasons: 1- Yakama Nation has not approved and reviewed the proposed curriculum, 2-Selah residents have not had enough time to review the proposed changes, 16 parents, including me were applicants to be selections to the IMC, but only one were selected.  Alicia offered to send me meeting invitations, but if they met more, I was never sent an invitation.

Joe Dufault - Jeremie's dad is unable to attend, as he's on vacation and thanked everyone for their attendance.

Jim Lidickson - appreciates what was shared and agrees with the changes in the curriculum. He is a history buff and just read the book “Blood and Thunder,” which may be a reference book for teachers. In recent legislation, initiative 2081 states that parents can adopt out. How does this work? (Mr. McKay talked to Mr. Lidickson following the comment).

Elise Washines - Yakama Nation representative, who is the education manager for the Yakama Nation, as well as on the school board.  She is the liason for the tribal council education committee here tonight. There are emergency meetings regarding the fires going on. They want to send words to encourage adoptions and inform you of the Nation’s involvement. She is one of the original curriculum writers in 2009 with OSPI. Yakama Nation has adopted many options. We want to ensure the tribal law supports this adoption. When we work with the 71 school districts in and around the Yakama Nation, we have convenings at CWU or Heritage to work with all. The tribal laws support this curriculum.

Daylene Ackerman - read a comment for Jeremy Hines: I have searched to find something to corroborate the 5th grade coursework titled, " Encounter, Colonization, and Devastation Elementary US History" The statement in the text says, "Colonists at first thought they were successful, since no tribal people complained.  Tribal people remained silent, even while the colonists verbally abused and insulted them.  One chief, Powhatan, hoped the colonists and churches would fail, but the English kept going forward with their 'civilizing' tactics."  However, I have not found anything in days of research to back up that claim.  Wikipedia has an article which reduces the complexity and adds brevity to the subject as researched and published by the national parks service, the University Press of Virginia, "We're Still Here: Contemporary Virginia Indians Tell Their Stories" by Sandra Waugman and Danielle Moretti-Langholtz, and many other Indigenous and scholarly sources.  The only thing I can conclude is that maybe the author of the work published by OSPI is confusing the Virginia tribal group with the New Jersey tribal group (and a chieftain's name with his title).  Either way the we should be teaching children historical facts, not some person's opinion which clashes with the facts that were carefully researched by Indigenous groups, historical figures that penned memoirs, and different departments of the federal government in Virginia where this history actually took place. He is against adopting this curriculum.  I was trying to look at the RCW as it was recently adopted and it does look like Mr. Dufault may be right that it is to be implemented when a curriculum is adopted and it is not mandatory.

Patty Muldino - Worked in the district a number of years ago in counseling. She says she commends the board for making the changes requested, but is concerned about the kindergarten aspect and they’re going through a lot at this age leaving parents and thinks it might be more of a 1st grade resource. We need to support the kids and their families. There are so many new changes and she's willing to learn and many scared grandparents are learning all these things as they’re raising their grandkids. Is everyone notified when items are approved? Everyone needs notification. The whole community needs letters. Think of the younger kids' emotions.

David Smith - Originally from Wyoming. Much of the bloodshed happened in his state. “Baring My Heart that Wounded Me” is a good read of the almost-extermination of the Native American people. The ghost dance they did and they could eradicate the white race and return to a time of peace. This is important and should be taught, but should not be put before history of Gettysburg, Bunker Hill, the Holocaust, and WWII and those exterminated by the Nazis. This is equally important. Normandy invasion...and Pearl Harbor. This is equally as important. To hear the differences between the revolutionary war and civil war.

Dave Manning - Selah resident. 30 years involved in Yakama Nation as a sales rep in the area. We're missing the Native respect. They suffered, but not by me or you or anyone else in this room. We have an obligation to remember, not discourage, not belittle and lift them for the great people they are. They lived on this sagebrush long before we got here. When we take history through a woke picture by teachers who have an agenda. It is important to not make decisions on a woke position, but on facts. The Native Americans need to be respected, honored by who they are and their heritage respected. Teachers who pass along their one-sided agenda should not be tolerated. It was the federal government that did the most damage to the Native Americans, not the people in this room.

Richard Osland - Selah resident. Became aware of issue from a letter from Mr. Dufault. Misspelled "likely" on the front, which was ironic considering it was a critique of the school board.  He read the curriculum and quotations. Those weren't quotes at all, but summaries that Mr. Dufault made himself after summarizing the text. Going back to the address of the letter is really telling. He is running for political office and he is using the SSD as a political football. He's trying to divide the community and get everyone stirred up. I don't appreciate it. We're entitled to our own opinions, but not our own facts. We need to learn about history and if you don't learn about it, we're doomed to repeat it. His Catholic views may have performed more harm than good with Natives in the area. I hope the board can still do their job without this political pressure. Pretty much of the people here turned out due to the non-factual information they were provided.

Angela Peters - agrees the basis behind the STI curriculum looks beautiful giving the culture and language through a video from WSU and WWU in 2005. Implement SEL and emotional truths and geared questions on where our children's hearts and minds are being guided. What are they using to motivate their hearts and minds? I want my children to have a truth of facts. What is the motivation and why they have to be filtered through SEL.

Stan Shipley - curricula committee was one who signed up to be considered and was not accepted. would like to state that he came in 1958 and in the fall he began 1st grade in Selah with Mrs. Stroth. Graduated after 12 years in 1971. Will be 71 next month. He has 3 brothers and a sister who graduated. His parents owned Wenas Feed for 35 years. He is involved and loves the area. His family, the Corrigan's have still kept the store running. Has 9 grandkids all graduating from Selah, with the exception of 1 who has 2 years. I am willing to serve on the committee in the future. He has a bachelor’s and master’s. He had 3 meetings mentioned with only 12 showing up for the viewing. Things have been fulfilled to cover the basis, but still a failure. Other avenues for advertisement should be considered than just 12 showing up.

Michelle Kerslake - teacher of 3rd grade at SIS. It is a great place to work. There is some misunderstanding of what teachers teach. The only agenda we have is to make sure all students learn as much as they are capable of learning in the time we have them. We will ensure their safety, learning, growth and that's our only agenda. We don’t push our own beliefs on people. We teach what the board and state has told us to. as a teacher and parent of a student in this district and I am proud of this country, too. We need to learn as much as we can to not make the same mistakes again. We need to ensure we're reviewing our history and being honest about it. Thank you for the opportunity to work with the tribes.

Written comments for the record were received from Jeremie Dufault, Jeremy Hines, Ryan Franklin, Linda Dunlap, Maria Mayhue, Roy Dove, Jeremy Hines (revised), Dr. Leo Figgs, Ted and Lisa Pooler, and Wade Gano.
  Jeremie Dufault: My name is Jeremie Dufault. I have two children who attend Selah public schools. I ask that the Board not adopt the proposed Since Time Immemorial curriculum. If the Board chooses to adopt it, I ask that at least four items that are inaccurate, objectionable, and unnecessary be removed from the proposed curriculum.
  I further request that any replacement items focus on the culture and history of Native Americans in our region without contradicting the well-established history of the United States and without providing inaccurate portrayals of founding documents like the US Constitution, important institutions such as the US military, or the Christian faith.
  (1) Please remove “Keepunumuk: Weeachumun’s Thanksgiving Story.” The book, included in the kindergarten and other grade level modules of the proposed STI curriculum, undermines a uniquely American holiday focused on gratitude and cross-cultural cooperation. It claims without support that the Thanksgiving “meal changed both our lives and theirs forever. Many Americans call it a day of Thanksgiving. Many of our people call it a day of mourning.” The front jacket states, “Every American child learns about the first Thanksgiving. But Thanksgiving didn’t happen the way most children are taught.” Then on the second to last page under the heading “The Wampanoag Storytelling Tradition,” it concedes that “Sadly, the Wampanoag side of the [Thanksgiving] story was lost after a majority of tribal members died from warfare and disease introduced by newcomers…This book is a new story…”
  (2) Please remove the 5th Grade lesson titled “Encounter, Colonization, and Devastation.” It states that Native Americans resisted conversion to Christianity. In our Valley, Chief Kamiakan invited and protected Catholic missionaries at the St. Joseph’s Ahtanum Mission and encouraged conversion among his people. To this day, the Diocese of Yakima and the Yakama Nation maintain a positive relationship and collaborate on a number of health, education, and religious initiatives. The question set for the 5th Grade lesson also includes the unsupported and inaccurate statement that, “the [American] Revolution was about the control of Indian lands as much as it was about colonial independence”.
  (3)&(4) Please remove “An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States” and “An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States For Young People.”
Here are excerpts from An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States:
  The United States of America was founded by Christian, white supremacist, genocidal, land thieves.
  Thanksgiving and the 4th of July should be days of regret and mourning.
  US history is provincial and chauvinistic and should be re-written and taught through the lens of Marxism instead.
  Patriotic US citizens belong to the “Cult of the Covenant” for supporting the United States Constitution.
  The essential American soul is that of a killer.
  Andrew Jackson is a genocidal sociopath. And every US President since – including Lincoln, FDR, Reagan, Obama – has followed in his footsteps.
  The US military has always intentionally targeted and killed civilians.
  American exceptionalism is a myth.
  From An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States, by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz (ReVisioning History); pages 2, 5, 9, 39, 50, 94, 105, 108, 131, 178, 228.
  Jeremy Hines: I am well aware that RCW 28A.320.170 (https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=28A.320.170) requires school districts to use approved curriculum to teach the history of local tribes when adopting social studies curriculum.  However, I believe the curriculum under evaluation is the wrong choice as it throws a bucket of gasoline on the tiny fire of racism instead of a bucket of water.  Here are my examples:
  Ask yourself will this build the bulk of the population up or put them down?
"The United States of America was founded by Christian, white supremacist, genocidal, land thieves."
  Does this exhort Veterans or denigrate them?
"The US military has always intentionally targeted and killed civilians."
  Were there things done in the past that were not good?  Yes, and we don't need to celebrate those.  Not sure celebrating freedom from the oppressive rule of an oligarchy or celebrating all of the things we are thankful for is shameful.
"Thanksgiving and the 4th of July should be days of regret and mourning."
  The issue I have with this is that it tries to paint what we should be proud of as a nation as bad, and uses ALWAYS (which is a pretty extreme word) to label the US military.  I have attached an OCRed copy of Jamie's letter as pages 2 & 3 of his letter have even more examples of what is wrong with this curriculum (one example concludes that FDR is a genocidal sociopath which is directly in contrast to the ELA curriculum we adopted for grades 6-12 as that curriculum builds him up.  There are several speeches used in ELA that are from President Obama, but this curriculum says he is a genocidal sociopath (this would be the same as having kids study the speeches of Hitler because he was an eloquent speaker)
  Ryan Franklin - Selah school Board members - I wanted to take a moment to write and thank the Board for adopting this new curriculum. After reviewing the curriculum, it appears to represent a great improvement in providing a more well rounded education about our Country’s history and particularly the impacts on Native people.

I also thank the Board for rejecting the pleas of some to ignore parts of our history or pretend that those histories don’t exist at all. Our students will always be better served by having access to more accurate and complete curriculum. I hope that if there are things in our past that are uncomfortable to talk about that we would encourage our community to have more conversation about those events and how the impacts are still felt today.

Our community, culture, society was founded by, and continues to be strengthened by, a wide range of different people. This diversity includes different traditions, religions, and experiences within our history. Learning about these diverse views will help students become more thoughtful adults with the ability to see nuance in the issues of the day - a skill that is becoming more crucial all the time.

Thanks for your work,

Ryan Franklin
Parent, community member in Selah
  Linda Dunlap - My comments for the June 27th 2024 Selah School District Board of Directors meeting.
My name is Linda Dunlap. I am a homeowner in Selah. I am retired, I have no children in the school district and no family in the area. However, I am quite concerned about what I hear is being taught in schools and I feel like it is tearing our country apart.
I believe we should learn from history and not try to change it, erase it, or make children have bad feelings toward each other and/or the US. I have always been interested in learning about history. I have been fortunate to travel around the United States and I always buy local history books from the areas I visit.  History is often colorful and always interesting.  I was taught history in an unbiased manner that actually encouraged me to want to learn more about several places and people on my own time.  I feel if someone wants to learn about alternative history they can do that on their own time and come to their own conclusions.
I was given the following information and I find it quite upsetting. Teaching elementary, middle, or high school students the following from “An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States” is inappropriate and strongly unacceptable.
The USA was founded by Christian, white supremacist, genocidal, land thieves.
US history is provincial and chauvinistic and should be re-written and taught through the lens of Marxism instead.
Patriotic US citizens belong to the “Cult of the Covenant” for supporting the US Constitution.
The essential American soul is that of a killer.
Andrew Jackson is a genocidal sociopath. Every US President since, (including Lincoln, FDR, Regan and Obama) has followed in his footsteps.
The US military has always intentionally targeted and killed civilians.
American exceptionalism is a myth.
I strongly oppose this history program and I urge you to vote against “Since Time Immemorial Curriculum” for elementary, middle, or high school age students. This program sounds like it would be better suited as an elective college history program.
Thank you for letting me share my opinion.
  Maria Mayhue - My statement is this: 
I’m grateful that SSD has been consulting with Yakama Nation and YVC SME’s. Teaching historically accurate curriculum should not be controversial. I understand that some people want to hang on to feel-good stories and traditions, but rewriting history to suit a certain dialogue is not doing our children any favors. Teaching truth is not in itself divisive. It’s time to get rid of “the victor writes the history books” mentality and prepare our kids for the real world. In doing so, we can all grow and heal as a society. That will truly be something to be thankful for. 
  Please let me know if I need to forward my statement to another party. Thank you!  
  Sincerely,
Maria Mayhue
  Roy Dove - To Selah School District Board of Directors,
I am writing this email out of concern, hearing that the Selah School Board of Directors are in the process of voting for the “Since Time Immemorial Curriculum” for our district. I respectfully implore you to vote not to use this divisive material.
It is no wonder our schools are failing. Citizens are pulling their kids out of public schools because they are not being taught, or for what they are being taught. It is not the fault of the teachers or most of them but the fault of the system that is supposed to be giving them an education yet a dismal one.
I have heard at least one board member that sits on this board and a graduate of Selah say that they received a class A education. I don’t doubt it but that was twenty to thirty years ago. Our kids are not being taught what they need, to go out into the world and survive. Too much emphasis is put on the social and emotional learning curriculum. We need to get back to the basics, Reading, Writing and Arithmetic, Geography, Civics, Sciences and true History. Not the History that has been adulterated by bent authors with a set of ideologies that are contrary to what the truth is and what this country was founded on.
This curriculum is just that.
I am not sure if any of you have read George Orwell’s masterpiece 1984, I had that book as a required reading in my senior year 50 years ago and re read it again 3 years ago. If you have not, I encourage you to read it. He was a “prophet” in 1949 and we are living through that fake environment right now. Because “Since Time Immemorial Curriculum “ is very divisive, I respectfully ask you to vote no on this curriculum. I do not want my grandkids learning how to disrespect a country and a constitution that I as an Immigrant and veteran have grown to love and cherish.

“The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those that speak it.”
- George Orwell ,1984

Thank you for your time.

  Jeremy Hines (revised) - Dear School Board,
The quotes from the books that Selah School District wants to purchase offended me greatly (you can find these same quotes in the public comment Jeremie Dufault submitted).  I have relayed the quotes to my brother (he retired from the Airforce in 2021 after 21 years of service).  The quotes also greatly offended him.  He took the most offense to:
"The US military has always intentionally targeted and killed civilians."
If that were a true statement the US Military would be in violation of the Geneva convention (please click here to read the Geneva Convention as it pertains to the rights of civilians as per the UN: https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/geneva-convention-relative-protection-civilian-persons-time-war).  
Please do not spend any district money to buy books written by authors (even books that are simply teacher resources or library books) with such disdain for the military, government, or citizens of the United States of America.  I don't want to support such authors fiscally and you shouldn't want to either.
Thanks,
Jeremy Hines
  Dr. Leo Figgs - My name is Leo Figgs. I had two sons graduate from Selah HS. I also have lived in the district for over forty years. I want to express my strong support for the board’s adopting the Since Time Immemorial Curriculum.

The attempt by Mr. Dufault to “protect “ our students by censoring their access to the historical truth from award winning sources, is an appalling attempt to silence and discredit those of us that believe our children deserve to know the truth and not some distorted myths. Our children are strong enough to hear and understand that Americans have treated fellow Americans and especially indigenous Americans horribly. Students can learn about and see that there are long term consequences from the unfair and cruel policies that our ancestors either endured, ignored or committed. This attempt to minimize or hide the atrocities and mistreatment only perpetuates and exacerbates the cultural trauma indigenous people and others have experienced at the hands of the dominant culture. Studies have shown that school children do not experience the guilt that some groups of people claim may occur when children learn the truth.  In Germany, it is mandatory to teach the truthful history of what led up to the holocaust and Germany’s role and responsibility in it, including book banning that led to book burning. Our students are equally capable of learning the true history of how our country has treated its indigenous people and others. 

Banning books reflects parents being misled by those who project their own sense of guilt or offended morality. Some people prefer to encourage lying or feel good false myths by distorting or denying historical evidence and facts by eliminating access to accurate information and evidence. These actions continue to be encouraged and need to be resisted.  Our children deserve to know the truth about the terrible atrocities that have occurred so that, hopefully, they are less likely to repeat them. “ To learn and know this history is both a necessity and a responsibility to the ancestors and the descendants of all parties.”

I support the STI curriculum. 

Respectfully,

Dr. Leo Figgs D.O.
  Ted and Lisa Pooler - Dear Selah School District Board Members,
  We are concerned about the wholesale adoption of the “Since Time Immemorial Curriculum” as part of the history and social studies programs within the Selah School District.  As we understand, adoption of a program including a Native American perspective on our history is mandated by the State, and we appreciate the effort put in by the District’s Since Time Immemorial (STI) Review Team to assess a means to implement the requirements.  We agree with the importance of understanding our neighbors and benefits gained through this approach as presented at your last meeting:
  Increase respect, understanding and awareness for Native People and culture;
Reduce/eliminate stereotypes and ignorance about Native People;
Increase awareness of the Confederated Tribe and Bands of the Yakama Nation;
Demonstrate that schools value Native culture;
Increase communication between Native youth, families and school community;
Increase understanding of past, present and future contributions of Native People; and
Protect Native American Rights.
  However, portions of the curriculum appear to be teaching revisionist history and distort the truth.  Topics are presented based on feelings, with assumptions being made as to what was on the minds of those involved at the time. 
  Due to the State mandate, some form of STI must be implemented, but there seems to be latitude in the specific materials used to teach our students.  The background information provided to the Board at the last meeting included the following: 
  2015 (SB5433)-amending RCW 28A.320.170: “When a…district…reviews or adopts its social studies curriculum, it shall incorporate curricula about the history, culture, and government of the nearest federally recognized Indian tribe or tribes, so that students learn about the unique history and experiences of their closest neighbors.”
  Given this requirement, our preference would be the Board not adopt the STI curriculum recommended by the State, and/or presented in the STI Implementation Plan, but work directly with the Yakama Nation to develop curricula directly related to our “closest neighbors.”  If this is not possible, we ask that items which do not accurately portray established facts and relationships be excluded from the curriculum.  Specifically, please remove the following:
  Keepunumuk: Weeachumun’s Thanksgiving Story
The Fifth Grade lesson titled “Encounter, Colonization, and Devastation”
“An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States”
“An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States for Young People”
  Thank you for the work you do and for your consideration of our request.

  Wade Gano - My name is Wade Gano, I have been a resident of Selah since 1977.  My father’s family homesteaded in the Moxee.  My mother’s family has been in Selah since at least 1914, her family name was Lince.
I received Mr Dufault’s letter, urging the removal or banning of the book “ An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States.”  The letter urged people to put forth their opinion on the matter to the School Board at the public comments section of the Board’s upcoming meeting, as I will be out of town on the 27th I am submitting my comments in this email.  I would be pleased if you would share these comments with the other board members and make my comments as part of the record of the meeting.
Having never read the book, I believed it was necessary prior to issuing an opinion.  The book is about 537 pages of ponderous prose, not exactly a page turner.  I doubt any high school student, let alone a middle schooler would voluntarily read it.  Perhaps only the very curious or motivated seeking to understand U.S. history would undertake the project.
The major thesis of the book is that the Indians got the wrong end of the stick when it came to fending off the European invasion of America.  This thesis should not come as a surprise to anyone.  The Indians lost and the settlers won, which resulted in my family locating in the Yakima Valley.  The book doesn’t present any new discovery of how the Indians were treated by our ancestors.  However the book does convey the story from the Indians point of view, which is a somewhat new concept.
One of the purposes of education should be the development of critical thinking in the students.  That is people who are able to identify evidence, establish facts and come to a reasoned conclusion.  Critical thinking is good for everyone, if not solely for the purpose of identifying the fraudster who preys upon the gullible.
Critical thinking cannot be achieved by shielding yourself from contrary ideas of your own or the popular.  If we did that, we would still be convinced that the sun revolves around the earth.
Banning books is never a good idea.  To ban a book means you have surrendered to the ideas of the book and you do not have reasoned arguments to refute the ideas expressed.  Similar to sticking your head in the sand and pretending the ideas do not exist.
By having the book on the library’s shelf does not constitute and endorsement of the ideas.  Neither Amazon nor Apple endorse the book, simple by making it available for purchase.
I understand that some parents may not want their children exposed to the book, and that is their right.  But it is one thing to prohibit your child from reading the book, but quite another to prohibiting other children from reading the book.  If you do not want your children to read the book, you have the right to control your child, not the child of another’s.  
For reasons stated and more too lengthy to recite, I think it I’d bad precedent to ban books, in the long run it does no good for the education of the person.
Thank you for your indulgence.

  5. Administration
A. John McCoy Since Time Immemorial Adoption
Derek commented has a difference of opinion with the lawyer. There are 4 items: civics, economics, geography and history that are to be taught within social studies. My understanding when we review the entire curriculum, this needs to be adopted. I maintain that we don't need to adopt it until it's been required by law. If there's no tooth to the law, then why adopt it? I received 56 emails. There were 11 for and 45 against. That is 80% opposed and 20% in favor of it. One in favor didn't leave a name and another was from a Montana resident. We have to wholesale adopt what the OSPI has and I have reviewed it over 20 hours. I don't feel like oppression should be taught. OSPI curriculum is divisive and not unifying. To blame me isn't right. We could be in violation in our oath of office if we don't pass this. There are laws at odds with one another. I wholeheartedly agree the curriculum needs to be taught factually and don’t believe it's patriotic. I'm opposed to it.

Clarification was asked that a wholesale adoption of OSPI curriculum is necessary? Yes, the OSPI curriculum is included, but modifications may be made.

Jamie thanked the teachers.

Dan thanked the teachers. He expressed that our teachers are outstanding at teaching history and know how powerful different perspectives are. I am pleased with the replacement of the book that was controversial. I like the new autobiography, as it is local and rather than focusing on the horror. Thank you to the Confederated Tribes of the Yakama Nation.

There is a donation center at St. Paul’s to donate items to the White Swan-Harrah area fire.
  That the board of directors approve the adoption of the John McCoy Since Time Immemorial adoption, as presented.

Alicia Jacob presented data points.
  7. Associate Superintendent for District Operations Report
A. 2024-25 Budget Update
The objective was to bring expenditures more in line with revenues and we elected to do our budget reduction plan over the next three years to minimize the impact of cuts. We hope to have the budget balanced by the end of next week (July 5). On July 8, we expect to send it to review by the ESD, July 10 should be available for public review. July 25 we should have it ready for approval by the board. August 31 we will need to submit it to OSPI.
  B. Enrollment Update
We are ending with 3,604 for the June enrollment count, which is 8.73 lower for the year-end average, which is good. Our projection for 2024-25, we are projecting 29 fewer FTE than this school year. We are in a good spot.
  C. Financial Status Update for May 2024
We are right on track. We're lagging a little bit on both revenues and expenditures, which will catch up in coming months with grants and reimbursements. We are still waiting on two buses we ordered over a year ago and should be receiving them soon.
  8. Superintendent Report
A. Superintendent Update
Kevin congratulated the 2024 graduates and they represented Selah well. Ending the school year is exciting and the non-graduates attending and coming back on a Monday, there was a lot of excitement for them. It was positive for everyone at the end of the school year, with after-school trainings and events.
  B. Annual Athletics Report
Brandon Gillespie's report for athletics was included. Please reach out if you have questions.
  C. DRAFT Long-Range Facilities Plan
The result of the committee's work was included. Their 7 projects were highlighted by priority. The study and survey state allocation was changes and there is a greater opportunity for their compensation later, since we aren't in a hurry, we're holding off. With all of the committee work, you will see that we don't have any ability to go out for additional support from our community. We have areas of need and improvement; we don't have it in the cards. We have to pay off one of our bonds in 2036 to proceed with any additional debt. Smaller projects can occur with our current capital projects fund, but that will be determined at a later time.

Items to think about are our athletic fields, roofs and HVAC units.
