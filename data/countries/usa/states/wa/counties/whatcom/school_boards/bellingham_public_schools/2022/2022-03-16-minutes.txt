OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
March 16, 2022 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Bashaw called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. She acknowledged that this meeting,
while attended from various locations, is being held on the ancestral homelands of the
Coast Salish people. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw (President), Douglas Benjamin,
Camille Diaz Hackler, Jenn Mason, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day
(recorder). Absent: Director Katie Rose.
Audience:
Because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19, public participation is
limited to written submissions only, and all written comments received will be shared
with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all messages received.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
Matt Whitten, current principal of Shuksan Middle School, has been hired as the
Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, beginning in July 2022.
Tonight’s consent agenda contains a request to join other school districts in a lawsuit
against manufacturers of vaping products that have been marketed to kids.
Staff have been working to hold the next regular school board meeting in person. The
meeting likely would take place at a district location that has better ventilation than the
District Office. More information will be shared over the coming weeks.
The state legislature finished its budget work last week, and our lawmakers are deciding
how much funding the state will give districts. Some of the funding that is expected
relates to enrollment stabilization, outdoor education, mascot changes and the
prototypical funding model for school nurses and counselors. School budgets across the
state now rely on ESSER funds as a stopgap during the pandemic, which will go away
next year. The state has designated a 5.5% cost of living increase for school staff, and
because the state only gives districts increases for the state’s prototypical staffing model,
districts use local levies for funding the cost of living increases for all employees.
Budgets are now being reviewed to see what needs to be reprioritized. Dr. Baker
responded to questions from board members.
The district is holding a BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) Job Fair this
Saturday.

Kim Lund, the executive director of the Bellingham Public Schools Foundation, is
stepping down from her leadership position at the end of this month, and Sam Gearhart is
now transitioning into the position.
All four high schools recently participated in an eighth grade family night for students
who will be transitioning to high school next year.
Masks for students and staff were made optional in schools this week, and the energy has
been great. The district’s message is that all students and their families are now able to
make their own choices regarding masks. The final school-based COVID-19 vaccine
clinic is scheduled for March 26 at Alderwood Elementary.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Mason enjoyed the Sunnyland school visit earlier this month. It was great to see
the school in its current stage of construction. One of her takeaways from the visit
was how disruptive construction is while school is in session. The swing space model
contained in the recent bond will be helpful when the next round of schools is rebuilt.
She was impressed by the student who addressed the board about the school mascot.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler mentioned that she is again available for morning meetings and is
looking forward to the remaining school visits. She noted that Parkview neighbors
can attest to the disruptions in the neighborhood during school construction, but noted
that those living in the Parkview neighborhood are happy about how accessible the
new Parkview playground is. She also shared that her grandchildren love the new
Parkview building.
• While attending a dance competition, Mr. Benjamin sat next to someone who lives
across the street from Sunnyland and who is excited about the new building. Ms.
Bashaw and Mr. Benjamin attended an exit interview for the district’s auditor, and
Mr. Benjamin e noted that it is reassuring that the auditors, who dig deeply into the
day-to-day financial workings of the district, found nothing out of order. He
appreciated the comments from Dr. Baker about last few days of school with no
masks.
• Ms. Bashaw was not able to attend the Sunnyland visit but is happy to hear all of the
positive comments. She agrees with Mr. Benjamin about the thorough examination by
the auditors producing no audit findings. She reviewed the upcoming board meetings
and events that are on the calendar.

Covid response
Virtual methods
Parent academy for Spanish speaking families
Continued and expanded EDI efforts
Robust BHS mascot change process
Both print and electronic media continues to expand and improve, notably in
professional quality and gathering of metrics

CDH:
• The board is impressed with the amount of care and thought put into all communications. We
are particularly impressed with the launch of the Parent Academy for Spanish speaking
parents.
JM:
• This was a time that so much critical information needed to be communicated to our
stakeholders, with regards to COVID. While there were many perspectives, from both internal
and external voices, BSD communication remained level, well-informed and respectful.
• Responding to a significant in request in public records requests, which can often be a ton of
work!
• Consistent communication about the ongoing shifts to school meals.
• La Academia de Padres is a great example of meeting our community where they’re at and
developing effective community engagement programs.
• Continued, effective communication around EDI, even when there was challenging feedback.
• Graduations were a huge success and a much-needed joyful celebration.
• The mascot change taskforce did great work in developing a process to really evaluate the
impacts of the old/new logo and make a decision that took in a variety of perspectives. Happy
to see their work highlighted and communicated out.
• The family handbook is always such a beautiful and well-developed publication.
• The Playgrounds flier is a great example of making wonky concepts easy for people to
understand; always appreciate that about the communications from BSD.
• The Community Engagement Team really is one of the gems of this District. This report
really shows the importance of their work. We are a much better district because of this group
of people and what they do for our families.

4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Once again, I appreciate all of the evidence supplied in the report to show that our
superintendent is in compliance with EL-3. I still remember Dr. Baker pointing out the
importance of investing in Communications. You are either telling the story or playing catch
up and having to correct misinformation. I have seen firsthand when other organizations have
not done this.
DB:
• Appreciate the links throughout the report for a “deeper dive.”
CDH:

JM:
• Thanks for the “live links” that we could click on, as well as all the visuals.

• Hiring practices changed due to COVID
• The use of substitutes varied greatly (having to shift staff daily)
• Had to shift Employee Recognition to remote
• Block party with over twenty community partners and 1,500 families in attendance
• 1,600 volunteers

remarkable.

substitute teachers. We commend the superintendent for all of the hard work done to not only
recruit and train new employees, but in also thinking outside of the box to make sure schools
were able to remain open this year.

The board supports all of the work the superintendent has done for staff development. In
particular, the body of work to support staff and student well being is very impressive.
Overall, very impressed with the ability to continue adequate hiring and staffing, even with
the extreme impacts of COVID. This required creativity and quick adaptation as needs
shifted.
The virtual employee recognition and awards were a great way to continue highlighting our
staff’s work during this time. The Promise Awards video was a particularly fun watch.
Appreciate the diversity represented in the #humansofBPS campaign. They’re always very
interesting and represent the dedication of our staff.
Creando Connections was such an innovative and inspiring volunteer project.
Appreciate the intensity of EDI work that happens at all levels and across positions.
The work to mentor newer educators is so important to the current and future success of our
district. Glad to see so much work going into mentorship and ongoing support.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• MAP test data BPS students outperformed the state at every grade level except grade 11 math.
• I find it interesting that only Connecticut outperformed BPS and that they spend $7000 more
per student.
• The number of students at level 1 is a smaller number than the previous 3 years.
• Grade 7 reading/math showed the largest decrease while grade 6 reading/math showed
increases.
• Fewer K-5 students in the Lexia Literacy Progress are working below grade level than started
out the year.
• A large majority of our 3-5 students are on track in math according to DreamBox.
• Happy to see that from Fall 2020 to Fall 2021 that the majority of our students maintained in
both reading and math instead of sliding backwards during COVID.
DB:
• We appreciate the innovation in expanding beyond the tradition data sources given the
pandemic, particularly with suspension of SBA. This included things like the MAP,
DreamBox and other novel sources.
• The attention and effort to close achievement gaps is noted, as well as progress in some areas.
CDH:
• This has certainly been unprecedented times. Despite this, the board can see by this report that
the superintendent and his team have thought about what can be done to overcome any
obstacles. We appreciate all of the extra hard work and look forward to more improvements in
the next couple of years.

•

Outperforming the State at nearly all grade levels on the truncated SBA.
Students scoring above nearly all state averages on the MAP on both reading and math.
Positive projections for the SBA, which is impressive given the challenges created by the
pandemic.
While the goal is no achievement gaps at all, that the gaps did not grow is a testament to the
district’s work in working to connect with and serve all families during the pandemic.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KB:
• There is still a big gap between low income/non-low income, Latinx/Hispanic/white, IEP/no
IEP and multilingual learners/not MLL in both reading and math.
DB:
• The report identifies gaps that need continued efforts, such as students with an IEP.
CDH:
• None.
JM:
• As is noted in the report, working to continue closing achievement gaps and particularly
addressing the gaps for students with IEPs, remains a priority.
4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Appreciate the data and graphs included in the report.
DB:
• The data set is clear and readable.
CDH:
• The report was really well done.
JM:
• Thank you for the creativity in putting this data together as the typical test results were
unavailable.
