B. Budget Status Report
Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent, shared budget status reports for all funds as of the end
of May 2024, along with charts and data showing monthly attendance, general fund balance,
and general fund cash balance. The district had a larger than normal decrease in enrollment in
June in both Running Start and non-Running Start categories. As shared previously, a budget
extension for the current year will be necessary to address the higher Running Start costs. The
district will transfer some of the capital projects levy funding to the debt service fund in
anticipation of paying off the bonds next December. The money will be fully invested to ensure
it grows in value to allow for full repayment of the LGO.
Directors Scott and Rohrer inquired about the cause of the enrollment decrease. Mr. Lewis
explained the district has not seen an increase in private school enrollment or home schooled
students. Families are/have moved out of the district and new families are not moving in.
Demographers suggest this is due to interest rates, housing costs, etc., as well as changes in
military movements.
Director Tinsley inquired regarding school district enrollment in other districts. As a realtor, she
is selling more homes in areas like Yelm where housing is less expensive. Mr. Lewis shared that
is true, and where there is middle-priced housing, enrollment is increasing. In more expensive
housing areas, enrollments are decreasing.
Director McDonald asked what the necessary lead time would be for the district if enrollment
does begin to increase again. Mr. Lewis explained the necessary timing the district could
estimate, and shared the medium estimate prepared by a demographer projected enough
growth to need additional facilities could potentially not be until the 2030-31 school year.
Director Rohrer asked about the current maximum student capacity of our school district. Mr.
Lewis shared the projected enrollment for next year is 2947, and 1220 is the maximum student
capacity for elementary schools and 1800 is the maximum for secondary schools.
C. Budget & 4-Year Budget Forecast
Mr. Lewis shared the 2024-25 Draft SHSD Budget and 4-year outlook. He shared overall budget
information; enrollment assumptions; general fund budget summary; and information regarding
Materials, Supplies and Operating Costs He also shared information regarding the debt budget,
ASB budget, and capital budget. Mr. Lewis concluded his presentation with the F-195F 4-Year
Forecast.
A Public Hearing regarding the 2024-25 budget is scheduled during the August 21 Regular Board
Meeting. Community members will have the opportunity to make public comments regarding
the budget during the Public Hearing.
Overall projected budget for next year is 54.2 million dollars, with anticipated revenue of 54.4
million dollars, with the difference being applied to the fund balance. Mr. Lewis shared
enrollment is the big determining driver for the budget. Mr. Lewis explained how roughly 10% of
the General Education MSOC funds are used to fund special education, MLL, and HiCap
programs due to the severe under funding of these programs by the state.
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

The 2024-25 Draft SHSD Budget and F-195F can be viewed here.
Director Rohrer asked for a 2024-25 chart compared to the 2023-24 chart to look at totals in
order to have a comparison to see differences. Chair Scott shared it makes the most sense to
view forecast to forecast. Mr. Lewis shared this data is already in the information shared, but it
is not on the same page. He will provide that information combined into one chart to Dr. Weight
by the end of the week. Director Rohrer thanked Mr. Lewis for his great work to get the district
back on track.
Director Tinsley asked what should they have been looking at 2 years ago that would have
indicated a problem to them? Mr. Lewis shared one of the largest things is that the expenditures
shown were not growing while the district was increasing the number of staff. He shared the
tools he and Dr. Weight are now using on a monthly basis dig into each of the accounts to a
much greater degree. Mr. Lewis and Dr. Weight are providing many more reports to the board
than is normal, to provide transparency and ensure the work is accurate.
IV. CONSENT AGENDA
Director Lewis made a motion to approve the Consent Agenda, Director Tinsley seconded the
motion, and the motion passed (5/0). The Consent Agenda consisted of Approval of April and
May 2024 Accounts Payable and April 2024 Payroll; Approval of May 15, 2024 Regular Board
Meeting Minutes; Approval of Personnel Reports; Approval of MLL Annual Report for 2023-24;
Approval of Highly Capable Program Annual Report; Approval of Resolution 926-06-12-24
Cancellation of Outstanding Warrants; Approval of MOU between SHSD and ACTS; and Approval
of Sodexo Contract Amendment for 2024-25 School Year.
Director Rohrer asked a question about the May 15, 2024, meeting minutes. Chair Scott shared
meeting minutes are not a transcript of the meeting, but are a summary. The board recording is
available if anyone wants to hear the complete meeting in full.
V. OLD BUSINESS
A. Second Reading of Policy 5161 Civility in the Workplace
Superintendent Weight shared the first reading of Policy 5161 Civility in the Workplace at the
May 15, 2024, Regular Board Meeting, and the board was asked to review and provide
suggestions. Some language from the policy was recognized as being procedural in nature so
portions of the policy will be moved to a new procedure to accompany Policy 5161.
Director Rohrer made a motion to approve Policy 5161 Civility in the Workplace, Director Tinsley
seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
B. Approval of 2025-2030 Capital Facilities Plan
Mr. Lewis shared the draft update of the 2025 Capital Facilities Plan was reviewed by the board
meeting on May 15, 2024.
The plan was submitted and published by the Department of Ecology on May 2 and the
comments were due by May 31. In addition, the district published notice as required in the
Tacoma News Tribune and invited comments.
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

Page 3 of 8

Packet page 92 of 159

No comments were received by the district during the SEPA review period. No other comments
have been received to date.
The plan this year incorporates new studies on student generation rates and enrollment
projections. This year’s updated plan also includes impact fee calculations that address statutory
changes regarding impact fees.
The Capital Facilities Plan is shared with the Town of Steilacoom, the City of DuPont, Pierce
County and the greater SHSD community. This plan will be adopted by reference as a part of the
local jurisdiction’s Comprehensive Plan for purposes of identifying whether school facilities are
adequate to serve existing and proposed new development.
Director McDonald made a motion to approve the 2025-2030 Capital Facilities Plan, Director
Lewis seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
Director Lewis asked about any potential future plans for building around Old Fort Lake in
DuPont. Mr. Lewis shared the Capital Facilities Plan is a living, breathing document that is
changed every year, and the data is updated every year. The plan will be updated when and if
additional building happens in the district.
VI. NEW BUSINESS
A. First Reading of Policy 2022 Electronic Resources and Internet Safety
Mr. Lewis shared concerning Policies 2022 and 2023 - in 2016 and 2017, the Legislature passed
new laws concerning digital citizenship, internet safety, and media literacy. As part of those
changes, WSSDA was charged with reviewing and revising its model policy and procedures.
Since that time, many new issues and concerns have emerged in the areas of digital citizenship,
media literacy, artificial intelligence, and safety/security. To respond to these changes, policy
2022 has a minor revision but a new policy 2023 has been created specifically to address the
needs presented by this changing landscape.
Specifically, the new policy 2023: Defines Digital Citizenship Defines Media Literacy Outlines
the Elements of Successful Digital Citizenship and Media Literacy in the areas of Student
Instruction Professional Development, Policy and Practice Review, and Communications and
Engagement. The District will issue updated procedures this summer as necessary to provide
more details for implementation in the 2024-25 school year.
Director Rohrer made a motion to approve Policy 2022 Electronic Resources and Internet Safety
and Policy 2023 Digital Citizenship and Media Literacy, Director Tinsley seconded the motion,
and the motion passed (5/0).
Director Rohrer shared it is important it is to include parents in the conversation,
communication, and education.
Director McDonald brought up the wisdom of keeping students off social media for as long as
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

Page 4 of 8

Packet page 93 of 159

possible and asked if the district had a policy around that? Mr. Lewis shared we do not have a
specific policy or practice around that, but the district can engage in that conversation. He
mentioned the great progress the middle school has had in this area, but acknowledged there is
certainly room for improvement.
B. First Reading of Policy 2023 Digital Citizenship and Media Literacy
Director Rohrer made a motion to approve Policy 2022 Electronic Resources and Internet Safety
and Policy 2023 Digital Citizenship and Media Literacy, Director Tinsley seconded the motion,
and the motion passed (5/0).
C. First Reading of Policy 2124 Physical Education and Health Class(Action)
Mr. Lewis shared regarding Policies 2124, 6700, 6701, and 6702:
Policy 6700 has historically included the district policies associated with Student Nutrition and
Food Service, Recess, Physical Education, and Staff and Student Wellness. This policy has
increased in scope significantly over the past several years based on new laws and new state
and federal guidance.
Recently, WSSDA provided new model policies that divides policy 6700 into several separate
policies, each covering distinct areas. Staff reviewed the new WSSDA model policy structure and
agrees that it makes sense to divide up the policies into new policies:
• 2124 Physical Education and Health Class
• 6701 Recess and Physical Activity
• 6702 Wellness
Policy 6700 will be retained with only the Nutrition portion of the existing policy.
While there were minor changes in the policy language, there are no changes that are
substantive or impact existing practice.
Director McDonald made a motion to approve Policy 2124 Physical Education and Health Class,
Policy 6700 Nutrition, Policy 6701 Recess and Physical Activity, and Policy 6702 Wellness;
Director Lewis seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
Director McDonald asked about taking away recess from students as a discipline procedure. Mr.
Lewis shared that is in the discipline policy. Director McDonald noticed it is not crossreferenced, and asked if that would be possible. Mr. Lewis responded the district can include
the additional cross-reference without going to the board for a second reading.
Director McDonald also commented how Cherrydale offers fruit-infused water, and the students
use it and love it. She commended the Food Service team for offering this option.
D. First Reading of Policy 6700 Nutrition
Director McDonald made a motion to approve Policy 2124 Physical Education and Health Class,
Policy 6700 Nutrition, Policy 6701 Recess and Physical Activity, and Policy 6702 Wellness;
Director Lewis seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).

G. Approval of 2024-2025 School Board Meeting Schedule
Dr. Weight shared the draft schedule includes a longer visit to Anderson Island Elementary in
June to allow more quality time with stakeholders on Anderson Island. Anderson Island
Elementary staff are very excited about this option.
Director Rohrer made a motion to approve the 2024-2025 School Board Meeting Schedule,
Director Tinsley seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
H. Family & Student Handbook Review
In Executive Director Susanne Beauchaine's absence, Assistant Superintendent Shawn Lewis
shared a presentation regarding the district student handbook review. Mr. Lewis shared the
purpose of the student handbook, the development process, and the implementation and
communication process. The district will be moving to an online website version of the
handbook for the 2024-25 school year. Mr. Lewis also shared the timeline for these processes.
I. Board Calendar
Dr. Weight shared the only agenda item on the July 17 Regular Board Meeting agenda is the
Consent Agenda with two items, and recommended a Zoom meeting in order to save the district
tech team from setup time, as well as board travel time.
Director Lewis made a motion to move the July 17 Regular Board Meeting to a Zoom format at
6:00 p.m., Director Tinsley seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
J. Board Goal - Professional Learning
The Board established professional learning goals for the 2023-24 school year based on the
most recent Board self-evaluation process. This agenda item is a “standing” item at our Regular
Board Meetings to provide an opportunity for Board members to discuss their goals.
Chair Scott shared information he received from the WSSDA regional meeting he attended in
Carbonado regarding a board self-assessment at the end of each board meeting. One board
member would be in charge of completing an assessment for each meeting. He asked board
members their thoughts.
Director McDonald shared it is an interesting accountability tool.

Director Rohrer shared this would be helpful if they were a problematic board, but said she
could take it or leave it.
Director Lewis shared he likes the idea.
Director Tinsley stated they should try it beginning next year.
Chair Scott shared it would be from the perspective of whichever board member is completing
the survey, and suggested they give it a try. He asked board members to look at the format and
suggest any changes they would like to see.
VII. BOARD COMMUNICATION
•

From Cherrydale Principal Ryan Douglas - As a first-year principal, Laura Johnson was my rock.
That support has continued over the last eight years, and my debt of gratitude toward her
cannot be overstated. She is a consummate professional - kind, caring, detail-oriented, and
compassionate. You will not find a harder worker. Laura always wanted to be a teacher, but life
got in the way and she never earned her credentials. Instead, as I’ve told her before, she skipped
teaching and went right to assistant principal. Thank you, Laura. Professionally and personally,
I’ll forever be grateful.

•

From Saltar's Point Principal Alex Clauson - Every year we have visitors come through our
buildings. Parents, admin, other districts and even students. The other day, a student asked me
how old the building is. I did the math and said, "Wow. It's 25 years old this year." The student
was quiet for a second and said, "it sure doesn't look that old." I hear this all the time and it is
because of the quality of work our head custodian does. Lori Wilson is amazing. I've never seen
her be idle in her job and she is always looking for ways to improve our building. She stocks our
window boxes each spring, scrapes debris out of the cement cracks (which she loves doing),
checks the field to see if it's too muddy and keeps the classrooms and building clean throughout
the day. I walked in to my office the other day and the video camera was on my screen. I could
see Lori was sweeping wood chips off of the sidewalk. This is the dedication to our building and
students that makes her such an amazing individual Lori's work does not go
unrecognized. Every time I hear how great this building looks I immediately give her the credit.
Thank you, Lori, for all you do for our kids!

VIII. ANNOUNCEMENTS
• Director Rohrer said she will miss the SHSD staff moving on.
• DIrector Tinsley congratulated the high school on a great graduation celebration, and shared she
really enjoyed the St. Martin’s University venue.
• Director McDonald shared she loves the staff ownership of district employees of where they are
and working to create a better place. She shared we are saying goodbye to staff who have
created a better place here in the district.
IX. ADJOURNMENT
Director McDonald made a motion to adjourn the meeting at 7:30 p.m., Director Rohrer
seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).

Any neglect of this requirement shall constitute sufficient cause for disciplinary action. Each employee
shall be entitled to appropriate assistance, support, and enforcement from building or program
administrators in connection with discipline problems relating to students. The building or program
administrator and staff will be responsible for the monitoring and follow-through of disciplinary actions.
3.5.5.1 The District will take reasonable efforts to ensure that there is appropriate flow of information
regarding necessary information to support the social, emotional and learning needs of each
student. Employees assigned to work directly with a student with a safety support plan will be
provided appropriate information regarding such plan. Employees shall have access to students’
disciplinary records when educationally appropriate
3.5.5.2 In accordance with WAC 392-400-330 and RCW 28A.600.020, a teacher may, in appropriate
circumstances, exclude a student from the teacher’s classroom for behavioral violations that
disrupt the educational process while the student is under the teacher’s immediate supervision.
In no event without the consent of the teacher may an excluded student return to the class
during the balance of that class or activity period or up to the following two days, or until the
principal or his or her designee and the teacher have conferred. Such exclusion must be
consistent with all legal requirements.
The “conferring” between the principal or designee and staff member should include an
opportunity, if requested by the staff member, for a genuine dialogue at an educationallyappropriate time about the student’s unexpected behavior and the steps already taken, and those
necessary to be taken, to successfully restore positive educational relationships within the
classroom. Restoring relationships may, in appropriate circumstances, require the inclusion of the
student and/or other facilitators in the dialogue. Restorative practices will also include, where
appropriate, responsive measures aimed at reinforcing district and building expectations for
student behavior consistent with the district continuum of discipline responses. In all cases, the
parties have a joint goal to minimize the loss of instructional activity and content due to the
classroom exclusion.
3.5.5.3 The District shall ensure that appropriate behavioral supports and Social Emotional Learning
(SEL) instruction are provided for students who exhibit behaviors that interfere with their
learning or the learning of other students. Instructional support for SEL and restorative practices
may be provided to the student in a supportive learning space that will not impact the classroom
setting.
3.5.6

The principal shall be responsible for ensuring each school has documented plans for responding to
unanticipated and reasonably-anticipated situations in which a student needs to be deescalated and other
students are removed from the classroom or instructional area in order to protect them and facilitate deescalation of the student. Such plans shall be responsive to the possibly evolving needs and patterns of
particular students; accommodating to the physical and emotional needs of staff members involved in
such incidents; and thoughtful about the potential need to communicate with staff and the families of
students witnessing such incidents. All staff members shall respect the legal confidentiality of student
records and information related to the behavior.

3.5.7

Each employee shall be promptly advised on any complaint made to the principal, program, or other
School District administrators regarding the employee’s discipline of students. The employee shall be
given the opportunity to present his or her version of the incident.

specified as a deadly weapon RCW 9A.04.110 or local ordinances may be placed on emergency expulsion,
according to State law and regulations. The parties recognize that schools are gun free zones and agree
that firearm possession will result in emergency expulsion (RCW 9.41.280).

3.5.10 Employees may use reasonable physical force as necessary to maintain order or prevent a student from
harming themselves, other students, school personnel or property (WAC 392-400- 825). A staff member

disruptive student in order to safeguard the health and safety of others.

the teacher’s performance over the course of the year. A preponderance of the evidence will be used to
develop the overall criterion scores. No scores will be given to individual components. Employees will be
encouraged to use the Evidence Menu as a guide. Criterion scores will be added to reach a Summative
score. The OSPI approved Summative scoring band is shown below.

Attachment #10 – Family and Medical Leave
Employee Eligibility
To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must:
1. Have worked for that employer for at least 12 months; and
2. Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to the start of the FMLA leave
Leave Entitlement
A covered employer must grant an eligible employee up to a total of 12 workweeks of unpaid leave
in a 12 month period for one or more of the following reasons:
• for the birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child;
• for the placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly
placed child;
• to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent -- but not a parent "in-law") with a
serious health condition; and
• when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition.
Leave to care for a newborn child or for a newly placed child must conclude within 12 months after
the birth or placement. (See CFR Section 825.201)
Spouses employed by the same employer may be limited to a combined total of 12 workweeks of family leave
for the following reasons:
• birth and care of a child;
• for the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly placed child; and
• to care for an employee's parent who has a serious health condition.
Intermittent/Reduced Schedule Leave - The FMLA permits employees to take leave on an intermittent basis or to
work a reduced schedule under certain circumstances. CFR Section 203)
•
•

Intermittent/reduced schedule leave may be taken when medically necessary to care for a
seriously ill family member, or because of the employee's serious health condition.
Intermittent/reduced schedule leave may be taken to care for a newborn or newly placed
adopted or foster care child only with the employer's approval.

Employees needing intermittent/reduced schedule leave for foreseeable medical treatment must work with
their employers to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the employer's operations, subject to the
approval of the employee's health care provider. In such cases, the employer may transfer the employee
temporarily to an alternative job with equivalent pay and benefits that accommodate recurring periods of
leave better than the employee's regular job.
Substitution of Paid Leave - Employees must use accrued paid leave to cover some or all of the FMLA leave taken.
Serious Health Condition - "Serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental
condition that involves either:
•

any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital,
hospice, or residential medical care facility, and any period of incapacity or subsequent treatment in
connection with such inpatient care; or

55
Packet page 154 of 159
Page 55 of 59

•

Continuing treatment by a health care provider with includes any period of incapacity (i.e., inability
to work, attend school or perform other regular daily activities).

This could include, but is not limited to, pregnancy, prenatal care, chronic health conditions such as
asthma or diabetes, and permanent or long-term conditions such as Alzheimer’s, stroke, or cancer.
Medical Certification - An employer may require that the need for leave for a serious health condition of the
employee or the employee's immediate family member be supported by a certification issued by a health care
provider. The employer must allow the employee at least 15 calendar days to obtain the medical certification.
An employer may, at its own expense, require the employee to obtain a second medical certification from a
health care provider.
Maintenance of Health Benefits
A covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage, including family coverage, for
an employee on FMLA leave on the same terms as if the employee continued to work.
Job Restoration
Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee must be restored to his or her original job, or to an
"equivalent" job, which means virtually identical to the original job in terms of pay, benefits, and other
employment terms and conditions.
Notice
Employee Notice - Eligible employees seeking to use FMLA leave should request leave as soon as possible.
Other Provisions
Teachers may not be able to take intermittent or reduced-scheduled leave for planned medical treatment that
may take them out of the classroom for more than 20 % of the time. In such cases, the employee may be
required to take continuous leave for the entire treatment period depending on the nature of the medical
condition and classroom needs.
Teachers and educational assistants also may not be able to return from leave near the end of the school term.
Depending on the timing and the reason for the leave, the district can require the employee to extend their
leave and return at the beginning of the next term, rather than in the closing days of the current term.
Nothing contained above shall be construed to deny or restrict to either party such rights as they may have
under applicable laws and regulations. FMLA will be governed in accordance with the Federal Family Medical
Leave Act. For coverage, process, and procedures contact human resources.

Attachment #11 – Just Cause/Seven Key Tests
The basic elements of just cause, which different arbitrators have emphasized, have been reduced
by Arbitrator Carrol R. Daugherty to seven tests. These tests, in the form of questions, represent the
most specifically articulated analysis of the just cause standard as well as an extremely practical
approach.
A “no” answer to one or more of the questions may mean that just cause either was not satisfied or
at least was seriously weakened in that some arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory element was
present.
Notice: “Did the employer give to the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible
or probable consequences of the employee’s disciplinary conduct?”
Reasonable Rule or Order: „Was the employer’s rules or managerial order reasonably related to a)
the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the employer’s business and b) the performance that
the employer might properly expect of the employee?”
Investigation: “Did the employer before administering the discipline to an employee, make an effort
to discover whether the employee did in fact violate or disobey a rule or order of management?”
Fair Investigation: “Was the employer’s investigation conducted fairly and objectively?”
Proof: “At the investigation, did the judge’ obtain substantial evidence or proof that the employee
was guilty as charged?”
Equal Treatment: “Has the employer applied its rules, orders, and penalties even-handedly and
without discrimination to all employees?”
Penalty: “Was the degree of discipline administered by the employer in a particular case
reasonably related to the following?
a) the seriousness of the employee’s proven offense, and
b) the record of the employee in his service with the Employer?
