## 2024-05-08 - PULLMAN_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The City of Pullman CIP/TIP Committee held a special meeting on May 8, 2024, to discuss the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) for 2025-2030. During the meeting, the committee selected Devon Felsted as chair and reviewed various departmental proposals. Notably, the "Traffic Signal Video Detection Project" was discussed, with a motion passed to ensure its inclusion in the 2025-2030 TIP. Additionally, a memorandum from Public Works Director Sean R. Wells was presented, highlighting an inadvertent omission of the Video Detection Program from the submitted documents. This ongoing project aims to replace outdated inductive-loop vehicle detection devices with high-definition cameras at city intersections, enhancing repair efficiency and adaptability to traffic conditions. The total estimated cost for the project over several years is $234,978, with a planned schedule for replacements at specific intersections from 2025 to 2031.
