Information: B. Budget Status Report
Mitchell Thompson, Director of Finance and Operations presented the budget status report. He asked the Board to let him know if they wish to have more or less details in the future.
He began with a slide to compare enrollment from last year and this year. Mr. Thompson went on to explain headcount vs FTE (full time equivalency) as well as vocational and Running Start.
Mr. Thompson explained that cash equals cash on hand minus outstanding warrants plus investments.
He voiced his appreciation to the North Central Educational Service District for helping to pull us up. He noted MLSD would not be where they are without the ESD's help.
Moving forward we have to watch our spending. There will be no levy money received in 2025.
Fund balance is so important. We need the money in the bank to pay the bills or we will continue to pay interest.
Mr. Mitchell explained the five accounts that money is allocated for:
General Fund
Accounts restricted for specific things.
1. Capital Projects-specific to buildings.
2. Debt Service Fund--specifically to cover debt which are outstanding warrants. Taxes come in and taxes go out. June is generally just interest. We are sitting about 3 Million in our Debt Service Fund.
3. ASB is specifically student money. Students raise it, they spend it, they are in charge of it. There was money that was sitting in an account that should have been transferred to the treasurer.
4. Transportation Vehicle Fund is only for yellow buses. We want to keep our fleet up to date the best we can.
  Ms. Urias how Vanguard is being utilized for our students. A class from CB Tech will move to Vanguard in the 24-25 school year and will occupy space at Vanguard. Vanguard has 459 students enrolled in Vanguard next year.
  Presentation: C. Early Learners Meet Standards (1c) Presentation
Nick Bontrager presented indicator 1c--Early Learners Meeting Standards, by the end of second grade. IReady is used as a screener for K-5 for the data being used.
Mr. Bontrager showed graphs with comparisons from the past years.
He went on to look at the current indicators for different core subjects.
IReady breaks it down by Domains.
Math by Domain
We have indicators, not goals.
Observations made and potential actions ELA has been improving since 2021.
He shared observations he had made based on the data which is indicated in his presentation found at https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/moseslake/Board.nsf/Private?open&login#
Both Math and ELA have increased since 2021.
Mr. Bontrager, at the request of the Board at a study session, looked into Common Core to see if it had an impact at all. After light research, he found Common Core for WA state was adopted July 20, 2011, but has been around since 2009. He showed scores and noted Common Core doesn't appear to have had a profound impact on math scores.
We appear to be recovering from a COVID dip and are at baseline now, with progress being made.
  Presentation: D. CTE Year End
Ron Mayberry, Career Technical Education Director shared CTE end of year report and the 4 Year Plan.
He shared general data, CTE Grant Information, and Career Tech Student Organizations opportunities for students.
The CTE enrollment across the two high schools had an average 482.9 FTE that were taught by 31 CTE teachers across the two schools and shared statistics from the middle schools as well.
He mentioned the graduation process that students need and the pathways they meet.
He also mentioned the Grants applied for and received as well as dual credit program we have with Big Bend Community College.
CTSO was highlighted and their accomplishments throughout the year were shared.
The four year plan was also shared and is attached to the agenda of BoardDocs.
New in 24-25 is that the Aerospace program will be housed at Vanguard Academy.
Several programs are expanding in many ways. Success 101 is coming to MLHS and we have added Teacher Academy 2 as well. Going forward we will add classes for Digital Learning Students to access.
Mr. Mayberry shared the many accomplishments of CTE high school students both individually and as teams.
The MLSD CTE Four Year Plan was shared and represents a rolled up version of what is already in place and has been expanded and they are working to even better align the programs to make sure we are making wise investments in equipment and replacing equipment. He mentioned they wish to align the CTE programming to local industry whenever possible and stay up to date.
Ms. Jensen asked if Mr. Mayberry had an idea of how many students in 23-24 students were in Ag Science programs and in FFA. She also asked about the CTE STEM programs. One teacher teaches within the STEM program. STEM and comp science need to grow and we are working toward that. Perhaps 60-90 students are involved.
Ms. Jensen noted Mr. Mayberry mentioned the goal to improve involvement by bringing more interest from non traditional enrollment. We would like to put forth effort to make sure more students would be in computer science. We would like to see more ethnic equality. CTE courses are an opportunity, not a requirement.
Ms. Jensen asked if there are any other grants available for CTE? The district office is on the lookout as well as the CTE Dept.
  Action, Procedural: E. Policy 1400 Meeting Conduct, Order of Business and Quorum

  7. Old Business
  8. Information Items
Information, Presentation: A. Superintendent's Report
Carol Lewis presented a Superintendent's Report.
Many questions were submitted and in the spirit of transparency Ms. Lewis put together a presentation. The presentation can be found at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AGQnwqQhqn0MJZGA6_YldlNEAkor9LAar-Oh6IIcPrw/edit?usp=sharing or attached to the agenda on BoardDocs. There are also quite a few supporting documents also included in the BoardDocs agenda.
Ms. Lewis touched on a few items that have been questioned recently:
Bargaining with MLEA has been scheduled for July 29, August 1, 6 and 9.
Staff Extra Duty Pay includes all items coded to extra hours. Extra pay can be so many different things from classroom overage, classroom coverage, stipends for co-curricular activities, overtime, extracurricular contracts, as well as gate and ticket staff. A system for developing more clear accounting codes is being created. Detailed information will be shared during Budget Status presentations at Board meetings.
Cashouts when employees cash out any leave they have and didn't use.
Community Use of Pool. The rumors of the City of Moses Lake wanting to run and fund the MLSD pool are unfounded. Solutions are being explored for facility use that will hopefully work for everyone.
Professional Development cost through June 18, 2024 of this school year specifically spent with Solution Tree was $460,378.28. During the 22-23 school year a higher than normal amount of money was spent on professional due to curriculum adoptions and the professional development surrounding that which includes not only training, but substitute costs as well.
ESSER 3 Funds--Approximately $650,000 was requested by the Assistant Superintendent to be spent on professional development with Solution Tree (including all travel expenses) out of the $8,000,000 ESSER 3 funds we were told remained during the 2023-24 school year. Later an additional $399,000 was requested for the future professional development. Much of the remaining $7.3 million was in the planning stages by the former C.O.O. and fortunately did not come to fruition.
Ms. Lewis noted the Professional Learning Communities are a vital part of MLSD to students and staff. The message being emphasized to all is the sense of belonging and trainings were a huge part of building this theme the last couple of years.
Mr. Kovalenko, Principal of Midway, and Mr. Ramirez, Principal of Endeavor, both shared the remarkable differences these trainings have made in their school communities. It is a known fact that what we wish to ignite in others we must first burn within ourselves. We want to reach all students.
Ms. Lewis shared a great deal of information concerning finances and also how many costs are being addressed to minimize them in the future.
Accounting Codes--New system is being developed and will be shared and updated on the website. The audit committee comprised of Mr. Thompson and two Board members will meet regularly to review the finances of the district.
ASB Funds--Students 7-12 are in charge of their own funds. Record keeping person is done by secretaries in the schools.
Booster Clubs are financially separate from the school, however there is an umbrella that oversees all the booster clubs.
The Board was appreciative of the information Ms. Lewis shared.
