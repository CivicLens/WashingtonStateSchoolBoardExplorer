The Blaine School District No. 503 held a Regular Board Meeting on July 22, 2024, where several key topics were discussed, including updates on educational policies and community engagement efforts. Notably, Dr. Christopher Granger reported on the district's participation in the 4th of July booth, which facilitated community connections and feedback regarding a bond initiative aimed at improving facilities while maintaining tax rates. The board approved multiple policies, including updates to Policy 2190 on Highly Capable Programs and Policy 5005 regarding Employment and Volunteers, both receiving a second reading and adoption. A significant discussion arose around Policy 5251 on Conflicts of Interest, particularly regarding the provision of for-profit tutoring services by Blaine teachers to Blaine students. The board ultimately decided to retain the existing policy language, which was voted on and carried 3-2, amid concerns about potential conflicts of interest and legal ramifications. Additionally, the board discussed the implementation of live streaming for board meetings, with an estimated setup cost of $10,000, to enhance community engagement and public access.
