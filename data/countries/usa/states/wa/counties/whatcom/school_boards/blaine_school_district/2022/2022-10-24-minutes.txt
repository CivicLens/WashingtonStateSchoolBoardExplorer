  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Monthly Reports
Teacher/Principal Jessie Hettinga shared highlights of the program at Point Roberts Primary School, focusing on how the remote school functions in direct alignment with the rest of the district while offering unique learning opportunities to its students. Common language is used in the areas of literacy, math, and SEL, and Ms. Hettinga expressed appreciation for the district's significant investment in providing Pt. Roberts students with the curriculum materials needed for alignment with schools in Blaine. Unique opportunities for learning outside the classroom include nature trails, the beach, and the local library. Director Leu commended Ms. Hettinga on the visible classroom wall content which reflects significant learning, care, and love for students. Director Gibson thanked Ms. Hettinga for her work in implementing the full Fountas & Pinnell curriculum.

Monthly school administrator reports for Blaine schools were attached to the meeting agenda for review by the board. These were not presented during the meeting in Point Roberts. Dr. Granger commented on the reports and highlighted the high school's upcoming production of The Little Mermaid.
  B. Borderite Athletics Report
Athletics Director Chas Kok provided the board with a Borderite Athletics report. He described intentional efforts to promote character development in student athletes, with that being a primary focus over winning competitions. A Student Athlete of the Month is nominated monthly by coaches in the categories of Servant Leadership, Community, Toughness, and Coach's Choice. He described the new parent handbook which outlines expectations for families as well as students. This handbook is being updated regularly and will be provided to parents each season. The GoBorderites webpage is being utilized to constantly highlight student athletes and celebrate their achievements. Coach Kok described how sporting events are being live streamed, supported by a subscription-based service, and extensive discussion followed. President Thomas expressed his appreciation for Coach Kok and described him as a great addition and valuable leader for Blaine.
  C. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment for the month of October and discussion followed. Kindergarten enrollment continues to be significantly low. Enrollment figures close to the budgeted level were reported for Running Start and Open Doors. Despite the overall K-12 increase of 16 FTE, enrollment remains below the budgeted level. Director Gibson asked if the district has gained any clarity about the drop in kindergartners. Director Creydt inquired about the waiting list for Blaine HomeConnection and speculated that it could be a solution for the budget deficit. Director Leu suggested contracting for a professional evaluation of the district's demographics in order to inform future enrollment projections. President Thomas expressed concern that the district would miss out on hiring the best new teachers if that process is delayed until a need is verified in the fall.
  D. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of September. September's cash flow included funds from both 2021-22 and 2022-23. Ms. Porter explained the increase in payroll expense which reflected the new year's salary increases. Last year's ending cash balance was more than adequate to begin the new fiscal year, and the district's strong fund balance is good news for the 2022-23 budget. The General Fund's revenue as percent of budget is similar to prior years. Expenditures as percent of budget is slightly above the pace of the prior two years but similar. Low kindergarten enrollment has been the biggest curve ball and will have an impact on this year's revenue. The district will not experience any benefit from recent legislative action until future years. Director Leu expressed his thankfulness to Ms. Porter for guiding the district's finances through these challenging times.
  E. Staff Survey Report
Dr. Granger introduced Rich Hazzard from 17000 Solutions LLC who presented a report to the board with analysis of the survey results and staff support improvement plans following the survey of all staff on August 30, 2022. Mr. Hazzard provided background information about general trends that impact educational staff experience. He then described the premise and goals for Blaine School District's staff support project which started in early August with consultation with the district's leadership team, then engaged staff in a survey, and finally helped the district use that research data to create a strategy and roadmap for improvement. Mr. Hazzard reviewed the survey which consisted of 27 questions covering four areas of inquiry, specifically Workplace Environment & Culture, Professional Relationships, Job Satisfaction & Motivation, and Personal Health & Wellness.
  The quantitative survey results were reviewed, and themes that emerged from the qualitative responses were described. Dr. Granger summarized the district's plan to put this research into action, focusing on the following six categories: 1) Professional Development; 2) Culture/Relationships/Teams; 3) Job Satisfaction & Motivation; 4) Joy/Fun; 5) Recognition; and 6) Personal Health & Wellness. Mr. Hazzard ended the presentation with positive comments about Blaine's proactive work in this area which may be published and shared with other interested districts.
  There was discussion following the presentation. Director Leu commended the district's administration on efforts to address an important problem and working to make improvements. Director Gibson asked about the uniqueness of the strategies presented, and Mr. Hazzard clarified that the all-staff engagement model is specific to Blaine. The intent to put "research into action" was present throughout this work which communicates that staff concerns have been heard and there has been a response by the administration. Discussion continued regarding the positive and negative themes present in the survey's quantitative and qualitative data. Director Creydt expressed appreciation for the concrete, actionable ideas that came out of this work. She stated that small things can really have a big impact. President Thomas expressed appreciation for the high level of staff participation, and stated that the 120 staff hours spent on the survey represents a significant investment with a significant response in the 18 action items listed on the resulting roadmap. Mr. Hazzard added that the roadmap of action items also provides a tracking tool moving forward. The next steps are to determine who will do what.
  F. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
In this meeting, the board was asked to approve, in Personnel Matters, an increase in certificated substitute pay. The new daily rate of $172.50 will be the second highest in Whatcom County.
Also in this meeting, the board was asked to approve first reading of new Policy 3131 which addresses intradistrict transfers and provides clarity to this process in advance of there being a potential new elementary school.

Other policies on this meeting's agenda include 1400, 1410, and 1420 which reflect updates to the state's Open Public Meetings Act. Policies 1400 and 4210 also address new limitations on the presence of dangerous weapons at school board meetings.
