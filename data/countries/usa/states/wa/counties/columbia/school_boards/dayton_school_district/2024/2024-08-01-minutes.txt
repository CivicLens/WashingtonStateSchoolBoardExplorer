Special Board Meeting
August 1, 2024
        1. Opening Items
A. Call to Order
Board chair McCowen called the special board meeting to order at 5:03 p.m. in the district office conference room and via Zoom. Board members present were Zac Fabian (conference room), Jeff McCowen, Ryan Paulson and Aneesha Dieu (via Zoom). Grant Griffen was absent (excused). Also present were Superintendent Jeremy Wheatley and Business Manager Jana Eaton.
  B. Flag Salute
Board chair McCowen led the flag salute.
  2. Action Items
Superintendent Wheatley reviewed the history curriculum (text book) to be used for 8th grade history. The committee looked at three options and chose U.S. History American Stories Beginnings to 1877 published by National Geographic. The reason for the adoption is our current books are not in great shape due to years of use. The texts will be used as long as they hold up, which is the reason for the replacement curriculum, or if there is not a major change or revision to the text.
  Board member Paulson moved, seconded by director Fabian, to approve the US History Curriculum adoption. Motion carried 4-0.
  3. Adjournment
Board chair McCowen adjourned the meeting at 5:12 p.m. The next board meeting will be a regular meeting on August 21, 2024 at 6:30 p.m. in the high school media center and via Zoom.
    Respectfully submitted,
      Jeremy Wheatley, Secretary to the Board of Directors
