School Board Regular Meeting December 17, 2019
Community Member Andrew Gustafson provided comments about the minutes
from the board's November 2019 meeting and comments about the upcoming
levy ballot measure. Mr. Gustafson said his comments noted in the November
minutes were inaccurate. He requested written responses to his questions. In
regard to the levy, he asked several questions of the board including why they
were rushing into a special election, did they disclose that they broke a promise
to the community, did they know the legal limit of levy collection dollars, how
many administrators make over $100,000 per year, how they justify increasing
the budget and what are the taxpayers getting in return. He cited he had recently
built a new house for which the new tax will add another $1000 onto his tax bill.
He thanked Dr. Quinn for meeting with him and others. He said he has the task
of writing the "con statement" for the levy ballot measure.
Bond Oversight Committee Member Brian Lynch commented about taxes. He
said the committee, at its last meeting, talked about lobbying the legislature to
try to exempt bond projects from being subject to sales tax.

Principal Joel Francik who presented the highlight of the month.
Mr. Francik reported that the Whatcom/Bellingham Firefighters Local 106, in

to each child in the school. The firefighters received detailed sizes for the

during the school day. In all, 347 coats were distributed. Also, the firefighters

School Board Regular Meeting December 17, 2019
Information: 4.03 Discussed Monitoring Report for Results Policy 2.6 (R-2.6) Academic
Achievement in Art
Dr. Quinn and Assistant Superintendent Scott Brittain presented the monitoring
report for Results Policy 2.6 Academic Achievement in Art for discussion by the
school board.
Board members felt that reasonable progress was being made in all six goals. Ms.
Riddle reiterated the importance of making sure we use the equity lens in our
work. She said the "extras" the district provides outside the school day are very
important.
Referring to goal 2, Ms. Cool asked about the audit of the Arts Program.
Mr. Brittain explained the standards were updated in 2017. All teachers align
curriculum to the standards. Standards for the different arts are different as
related to each one of the categorical areas. Assessments are aligned directly to
the state standards. The audit is complete if we compile all of the information
and use the assessments to verify we are meeting the standards across the
district.
Ms. Cool noted that the socioeconomic status data was not delineated. She
questioned if one's status would hold them back from participating in a certain
program. Mr. Brittain said the district is working on that.
Ms. Cool said the district has a strong music program. She asked about the
students who are not able to participate in a musical, but might be able to
participate in a performing art such as poetry, storytelling, public speaking and
others. Mr. Brittain said that over 100 students participate in the musicals which
include many nonperformance parts such as sound, lighting and stage crew.
Ms. Riddle said that students are also free to suggest the implementation of a
club and work to find an advisor for the club.
Dr. Erickson will compile the final document for the response to the monitoring
report and present it for approval by the school board at its January 2020
meeting.
5. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
Information: 5.01 Report on Capital Projects Bond
Dr. Quinn provided an update on the Capital Projects Bond. She continues her
weekly updates on bond activities. At the Executive Steering Committee meeting
yesterday, they worked on getting closer to finalizing a site plan for the high
school. The plans will be shared with the Bond Oversight Committee and the
Design Advisory Committee for review. She said a lot of time is being spent on
the educational specifications for the high school. The ed specs describe
everything that will be in the new school. It is basically the Bible for design.

Ferndale School District No. 502
School Board Regular Meeting December 17, 2019
Information: 5.02 Continued Discussion Regarding a Policy for Community
Sponsorships of Programs and Projects.
Dr. Linda Quinn and Assistant Superintendent Mark Deebach continued
discussion with the board regarding a policy for community sponsorships of
programs and projects. At the board's last meeting, the district reviewed the pros
and cons of sponsorships. Mr. Deebach said he is researching what some other
districts have done in this area. He handed out some sample policies to the
board.
Mr. McLaurin asked about how much naming rights would be advertised in the
school and if there is a dollar amount attached to that right.
Ms. Cool said she spoke with Anya Milton, Ferndale Chamber Director, who
pointed out that it's not only sponsorships to look at, but also partnerships to
form with companies in the community. These companies are the future
employers of our students. Ms. Cool said she does not favor overcommercializing sponsorships. She suggested the district look at what projects
partners can help with and then hone in on the companies that might help the
district fill the gap in that area.
Dr. Erickson agreed that "a partnership" sounded better the "sponsorship." He
said he did some research online related to this topic. He said one thing to keep
in mind is how to work together when you may have multiple competing
businesses for a certain project.
Ms. Riddle said Seattle School District's policy speaks to the sponsorship aligning
to the district's goals and mission. She is in favor of that.
Dr. Quinn and Mr. Deebach will draft a policy and bring it back to the board at a
future meeting.
