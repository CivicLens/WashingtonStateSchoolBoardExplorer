WSSDA Self-Assessment: Time was spent reviewing the board’s goals from last year
regarding communication. Communications will continue to be a goal of the board, and
the district Communications and Community Relations Department will support the
board with this goal, such as publishing the Inside Schools newsletter. The board will
take WSSDA’s self-assessment again in May of 2020.
Board Meeting Assessment Data: After discussion, it was determined that GP-7.1,
Board Self-Assessment, is a helpful tool. In the future, the board member who will be
assessing the meeting will be identified at the beginning of the meeting, and the board
member who is making the assessment will ask for any comments from the other board
members to be added at the end of the meeting. Also, a summary will be provided each
year to be reviewed at the board’s summer retreat.
Climate Change/Conservation Discussion: One of the study sessions for 2019-20 will
be on the topic of climate change and conservation. Following that study session, the
board will discuss next steps regarding a possible policy or resolution.
