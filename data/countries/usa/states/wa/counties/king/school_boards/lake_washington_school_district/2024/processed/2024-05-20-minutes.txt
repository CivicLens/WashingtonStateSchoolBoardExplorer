  2. First Reading, 2024 Construction Levy
Lake Washington School District’s Building Excellence Plan is a multi-phase plan to provide permanent classrooms for students, address aging facilities and reduce reliance on portables. Phase I of the Building Excellence Plan was approved by voters in February 2022. Phase II will focus on aging facilities with a goal of rebuilding/enlarging the four remaining schools that have not received upgrades or rebuilds since the start of the 1998 modernization program. 
The board considered recommendations, received information, and feedback in five study sessions between March 2023 and March 2024. The Facility Advisory Committee provided feedback on recommendations for future facility planning to accommodate our changing enrollment landscape and continue to provide learning environments that promote excellence for students. 
An overview of the Construction Levy recommendation was presented to the board of directors at the regularly scheduled meeting on May 20, 2024. Board action on the measure is scheduled for June 3, 2024. 
Draft Resolution No. 2375, Construction Levy, authorizes a six-year levy to be placed on the November 5, 2024 ballot. 
The county requires notification of at least 60 days prior to the election date in order to certify the measures for inclusion on the ballot. The deadline for the November 5 election is August 6, 2024. 
  3. Second Reading - OE-9 Sustainability Policy, Reasonable Interpretation and Indicators
The Board unanimously approved the OE-9, Sustainability Policy, Reasonable Interpretations and Indicators, as presented.

The policy committee has met five times (8/16/23, 9/27/23, 10/10/23, 2/21/24, 4/22/24) to draft a policy for board consideration. The school board has engaged during this time in multiple linkages with students, staff, and parents to gather interest and input to inform the development of the policy (9/26/23, 9/26/23, 11/21/23, 12/5/23, 12/5/23).

  G. Superintendent Report
1. Superintendent Report
Dr. Holmen shared an update on a meeting he held with a legislator who recently asked great questions about school funding in Washington state. He also met with other local education leaders who discussed the issue of ample and equitable funding in Washington state’s schools. He shared the history of how we got here, including information about the McCleary decision that did not go so far as to “fix” the funding system. He shared details about Pandemic Relief Funds that were provided, but at different levels, to school districts across Washington state. School districts nationwide also face enrollment declines, including a 10% decline in Washington state. These three issues are causing many issues for all school districts across our state.
Washington Association of School Administrators (WASA) has proposed a legislative platform that would essentially stop the bleeding of funding needs in our system. This proposal includes fully funding special education, increasing materials, supplies and operating costs (MSOC costs), and fully funding transportation services.
