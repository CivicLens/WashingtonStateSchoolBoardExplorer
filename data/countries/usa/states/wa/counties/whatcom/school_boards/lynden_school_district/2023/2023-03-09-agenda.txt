2. Good News
Lynden Academy enjoyed a Valentine's Staycation for elementary students in February. Parents and staff ran a fun K-5
educational field trip in the building with art lessons, games and snacks with time to connect with each other.
Fisher Elementary is celebrating National Reading Month with several activities including a character parade, a book cover
contest, a visit from Thing 1 and Thing 2, a book fair, a visit from LHS athletes who will read to the students, and an assembly
on March 31st to end the celebration! They are also holding their Read-a-Thon fundraiser from March 8th - 22nd.
Isom Elementary had a chance to truly experience their Character Strong trait for February- COOPERATION. On February 22nd,
students arrived to find there was no power in the building! The repair by PSE took longer than expected, so teachers and staff
cooperated to get battery-operated lights in the hallways, bathroom, and other dark spaces. They also had some amazing
cooperation from parent volunteers who stayed to help until the power came back on!
Lynden Academy hosted a game night for middle school and high school students. The fifty students who participated ate
snacks, connected with staff members and each other, and played board games.
Lynden High School had a successful opening of their musical Fiddler on the Roof last weekend. The show will run one more
weekend on March 11th and 12th.
Girls and Boys high school basketball teams competed in the state tournament last weekend with the boys team bringing
home the coveted Gold Ball!. Many members of the community made the trip to Yakima to support our teams. Special thanks
to Athletic Director, Mike McKee and Administrative Assistant, Alicia Blankers for the countless hours they put in to make this
a successful trip for our students. Congratulations also go out to our band led by Trevor Galligan and our cheer team led
by Kellee Wallace and Catherine Douglas. Special thanks to our transportation department led by Shane Stanfill , Coach Roper,
Coach Wolffis and their coaching staff, and the many volunteer chaperones who show up and make sure our students are
safe, fed and get to where they need to be..
