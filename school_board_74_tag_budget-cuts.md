## 2024-08-02 - YAKIMA_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Yakima School District #7 board meetings in August 2024 focused on budget concerns and special education support. During the August 5th meeting, Frances Guerrero, YEA President, highlighted the detrimental effects of budget cuts, particularly on custodians and paraprofessionals, which impact teaching and special education needs. The board approved Resolution 07.23.24 for a Program Reduction in Force for the 2024-25 school year, outlining 39 FTE reductions while clarifying that no paraprofessionals would be laid off but reassigned. The board also discussed an interlocal agreement with West Valley School District to lower food costs and approved a contract for Special Education services not to exceed $2,000,000.

In the August 20th Business Board Meeting, the board adopted Resolution 08.23.24, which presented the 2024-25 budget without a deficit, despite community opposition to budget reductions. Superintendent Trevor Greene discussed rising costs for school districts and the need for community engagement through surveys to gather feedback on budgetary decisions. The board's actions reflect ongoing efforts to navigate budget constraints while maintaining support for special education services and ensuring community involvement in decision-making processes.
