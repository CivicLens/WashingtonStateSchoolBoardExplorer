  3. Reports
A. Budget Status and Financial Report
A Budget Status and Financial Report through the month of June was attached to the meeting agenda for review by the board.
  B. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
4th of July Booth: Many connections were made by Dr. Granger with members of the community who stopped by for information about Blaine schools. Vice-President Lazarus asked about feedback from community regarding the bond initiative, and Dr. Granger described the information he was able to provide about improving facilities while maintaining the tax rate. Dr. Granger felt the 4th of July booth was a positive opportunity which he hopes to continue offering in future years.
Reduced Title I Funding: Dr. Granger explained how the possible future nationwide cuts to Title I funding could have a significant impact on programming in Blaine. These financial resources are tied to Free and Reduced Lunch enrollment. The fiscal year for federal funding begins on October 1st which would result in those cuts having a negative mid-year impact on the district's revenue.
  4. Consent Agenda
Prior to the vote, Director Swinburnson asked why some contracts pending board approval were already signed. Dr. Granger explained that the board has historically been willing to approve routine renewal contracts retroactively. He also provided an example of a past contract that was signed ahead of board approval in order for the district to take advantage of significant financial savings. Dr. Granger indicated that the new board should give him direction if a different protocol is desired.

The board voted to approve all items listed on the Consent Agenda. Vice-President Lazarus announced the 5-0 vote.

  5. Action Items
A. Policy 5251 Conflicts of Interest: First Reading
Dr. Granger explained the markup of policy language attached to the meeting agenda and there was extensive discussion on the topic of whether it is a conflict of interest for Blaine teachers to provide for-profit tutoring services to Blaine students. Director Creydt expressed a preference to adopt WSSDA’s model policy language. Vice-President Lazarus expressed concern about putting administrators in an awkward position by asking them to approve requests for this on a case-by-case basis. He also shared an example of how this is not allowed at another institution. President Freeman voiced a preference to keep the existing Blaine-specific language.

Director Creydt made a motion to adopt WSSDA’s model policy language.
Motion by Erika Creydt, second NONE

Director Swinburnson expressed a desire for additional discussion and commented on the need for tutoring due to low academic scores for Blaine students. He explained his desire to change the district’s policy language to accommodate students’ need for extra help, adding that the current language allows students from other districts to access help from Blaine teachers but prevents those teachers from helping Blaine students. Dr. Granger explained that the district had budgeted for elementary-level summer school to address the academic needs of students, but the program could not be provided due to lack of staff interest. Director Swinburnson further commented that taking action on changing the policy now won’t make a difference for students during the current summer break, and he proposed repealing Policy 5251 immediately to open up the opportunity right away and then working on a policy update in the coming months. Vice-President Lazarus expressed concern that repealing the whole policy would impact more than just the tutoring conflict, and Dr. Granger reiterated that the conflict of interest language addresses more than just academic tutoring.

Director Galbraith identified with both sides of the discussion, and he has not settled on a firm opinion. Discussion continued regarding the option to repeal the entire policy, and Dr. Granger expressed concern about potential legal ramifications. Director Creydt responded with concerns about the legal ramifications of not allowing students to access extra help. She reiterated her preference to follow WSSDA’s model policy language and informed the other directors how to access WSSDA’s model policy manual online.

Vice-President Lazarus repeated concerns about not having a conflict of interest policy in place, and Director Galbraith pointed out that doing nothing at this meeting has the same impact on access over summer break as initiating the 2-month policy update process. President Freeman shared concerns about creating confusion and adding extra administrative responsibilities to manage the policy.

Director Freeman made a motion to keep the existing policy language, and Vice-President Lazarus seconded the motion. The board voted to keep the current language in Policy 5251 Conflicts of Interest.
Motion by Cliff Freeman, second by Ben Lazarus.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries 3-2
Yea: Ben Lazarus, Cliff Freeman, Steve Galbraith
Nay: Erika Creydt, Ryan Swinburnson

Discussion continued after the vote. Director Galbraith wanted to address the topic again at a future meeting. Director Swinburnson indicated he would have seconded Director Creydt’s motion after having a chance to discuss his repeal suggestion, and he didn’t appreciate rushing to a vote on the other motion. Discussion continued regarding how to update the policy language in a way that addresses the concerns previously mentioned. Director Swinburnson would not oppose WSSDA’s model policy language, and Director Galbraith suggested putting the matter back on the August meeting agenda for “First Reading” of WSSDA’s language. President Freeman referenced communication received by the board from a Blaine teacher and suggested that the directors consider the acceptability of that teacher’s proposal when deciding on updates to the policy language.
  6. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)
  A. Discussion and General Comments
The board discussed the following topics:
Director Visits to Schools (Procedure 1620P): Director Galbraith indicated satisfaction with how this is addressed in policy. There was no additional discussion.
Fairness in Competition and Student Safety (Title IX Regulation): President Freeman referenced resolutions adopted by school districts in Kennewick and Lynden. He indicated there would be value in taking a stand on this issue, and Director Swinburnson expressed agreement. The board directed Dr. Granger to draft a resolution similar to Lynden’s for board consideration at the August meeting.
Policies regarding individual director outreach to other entities: Dr. Granger explained that there has been confusion with state agencies, including the State Auditor’s Office, OSPI, and NWESD, resulting from communications those agencies received directly from individual board members in Blaine. Outside agencies are accustomed to receiving inquiries through an established chain of command which is typically via the district’s superintendent. President Freeman clarified that inquiries should be routed through the board president to the superintendent. Dr. Granger agreed that this protocol would help to prevent additional confusion in the future.
Live streaming board meetings: It was clarified that prior references to “Zoom” were interpreted as general reference to live streaming over the internet. Dr. Granger shared that he is working on a solution for live streaming of meetings to accommodate the board’s desire for convenient public viewing access, without recording due to the permanent retention value of such recordings. Meetings would continue to be audio recorded in compliance with the new statutory requirement. The cost to set up live streaming capability is expected to be approximately $10,000. He further indicated that the current year’s budget has funds earmarked for this expense because the requirement was anticipated. Director Swinburnson said this would be acceptable to him. Vice-President Lazarus added clarification that public comments would still need to be provided in person. Director Creydt commented on needing to see video to know who is talking. Director Swinburnson believes live streaming will increase public participation. Dr. Granger asked for the board’s expectation about the meeting in Point Roberts, and all concurred that the one annual meeting at that location could be audio recorded only with clear communication about that to the public.
