Meeting Purpose – Explanation of Student Roundtable: Dr. Baker thanked everyone
for taking the time to be here this afternoon.
Student roundtables give the school board an opportunity to strengthen the connection
with our students, and the school board is excited to hear what students and former
students have to say about their experiences.
Questions for Current and Former GRADS Students: Dr. Baker introduced Ms.
French, who facilitated a discussion among the students regarding the Teacher Academy
program. Student comments are below each question asked.
First Year Students:
Why did you sign up for this class? Does this connect to your future goals?
• The class has helped me to look at a future career serving families in the district.
• I thought it would be an interesting class because I may choose a career in
education.
• I wanted to see if I would enjoy a job in teaching and wondered if I would be
good at it.

What do you think is the number one problem that our school faces today?
• Kids adjusting to becoming adults and thinking about getting a job.
• COVID greatly influenced students, causing them to have less academic
motivation and interest. Since COVID, kids sleep more and skip more and have a
lack of school spirit and community engagement.
• Some teachers make class fun, which motivates students.
• I feel like there is a lot of talk about inclusivity and acceptance, but I haven’t seen
any advancement or efforts within the school in this area.
• Spanish morning announcements are a good step for making school more
inclusive for all.
• How can we keep students from skipping class to vape and/or smoke? Could vape
detectors be installed? Perhaps an assembly to talk about drug use.
In your opinion, how do our Teacher Academy programs support The Bellingham
Promise?
• The Teacher Academy promotes inclusivity and love for the whole student.
• It expands options for students and gives them motivation.
• The Teacher Academy gives students a taste for what teachers do every day,
including teachers at other schools within the district.
• Bilingual programs at a young age are important.
• Students can step outside of their individual education and get a bird’s eye view
of the district.
• It helps to see different ways teachers teach students, so you can take pieces from
all over and make it your own.
The students responded to questions from school board members.
Second Year Students:
Tell us about your internship last year. Where was it, what grade level and what
responsibilities did you have?
• I was in Mr. Stoner’s class at Whatcom Middle School. Most of my
responsibilities were helping students in the classroom, making connections with
them and helping them to stay on task. It was awesome being with students.
• I was assigned to Mrs. Evans’ seventh and eighth grade math class at Assumption
Catholic School. I walked around the classroom, assisting students and
occasionally teaching probability to seventh graders.
• I was in a third-grade class at Parkview Elementary School, helping individual
students who were behind in math. I helped them understand strategies.
What is your philosophy of education?
• I see students disillusioned with school due to COVID. If you weren’t paying
attention during COVID, you could quickly fall behind. Feeling included and
smart in a classroom helps tremendously. I want students to feel important, loved
and smart.

My goal is to empower and help students enjoy what they’re learning.
Never stop learning! School is not the only setting where students can learn.
Experiencing things and researching things are great ways to learn. Managing
stress and developing different strategies for different assignments are important
skills for students.

What did you learn in this class last year and why did you sign up for a second
year?
• I learned a lot about pedagogy. I have a broader idea of what teaching is and
really enjoyed working with the kids.
• I want to be a math teacher, and I learned how to involve all students in activities
and how to build an equitable environment for all students.
• Last year we learned a lot about philosophy and behaviorism. Individual and
group projects taught me a lot.
• I have more confidence going into the classroom this year and think I will have a
better impact on the students this year.
What is your favorite thing about Teacher Academy?
• I love reading with kindergarteners!
• My first internship was scary, and I didn’t even know how to introduce myself,
but the students were excited to learn from me.
• It’s cool to see how 40 hours builds professionalism and creates leaders in the
classroom.
• I struggle with public speaking, and this class has helped with that.
• I get to learn how to teach.
• The credits are very nice.
How does this class help promote equity and inclusion in our school? Or what can
this class do better to promote equity and inclusion?
• The Teacher Academy is good at promoting equity and inclusion. It has been
discussed at length in class. We have a very diverse class.
• We have one of the most diverse classes at Bellingham High School. Ms. French
mixes in a lot of Spanish when she teaches.
• I have always wanted to be a teacher and was surprised to learn how many others
want to be in education. It makes me feel less alone about pursuing teaching.
• I wish the staff at Bellingham High School better reflected the diversity of the
student body.
Graduated Students:
When did you take Teacher Academy, what have you been doing since graduation
and how did this class affect you?
• I graduated in 2020 and took the class as a junior and a senior. I’m now attending
Western Washington University (WWU) with the goal of becoming a teacher. I
have been a substitute paraeducator for Nooksack Valley Schools.

I graduated in 2019 and always knew I wanted to become a teacher. I graduated in
2022 from WWU with a bachelor’s degree in Spanish. I’m currently pursuing a
master’s in teaching at WWU, working as a substitute paraeducator and have an
emergency teaching certificate. This class helped me to begin on the path to being
a teacher.
I graduated in 2023 and am in the Automotive Collision Repair Technology
program at Bellingham Technical College (BTC). I was in the Teacher Academy
program during my junior and senior year of high school, and while I never
investigated becoming a teacher, the class helped me. My internships were in a
physical education class at Whatcom Middle School and a first-grade class at
Sunnyland Elementary School. I have younger siblings, and what I learned during
my internships has been helpful to me in my family life and will be helpful for
when I become a parent. I gained a lot of patience.

What are your best memories of the Teacher Academy Class?
• Working together with other students to make bulletin boards.
• The cohort experience while in Teacher Academy felt community based. We had
a lot of collective agreements for holding each other accountable.
• Going to other high schools and collaborating was fun.
• I really enjoyed attending a field trip with a first-grade class.
• Being with 7-year-olds every morning was awesome.
What do you wish could be changed or different about our high school education?
What can we do better to prepare you for your future?
• Preparing for career readiness is valuable, as it helps students know if they want
to pursue a career in that field.
• An allergy caused me to miss a lot of class time, which was out of my control and
difficult. The COVID pandemic and remote learning was somewhat of a blessing
to me. It was disappointing when I lost my 504 Plan due to faulty allergy testing.
Dr. Baker asked if any of the school board members had questions or comments:
•

•

Ms. Diaz Hackler asked Ms. French why she wanted to teach this class. Ms.
French responded that she had taught a similar class in California, and she was
excited to teach this program when it began six years ago at Bellingham and
Squalicum high schools.
Ms. Mason thanked the current and former students. She commented that she
loved hearing that we’re all always learners and educators.

Dr. Baker thanked everyone for being here this afternoon. Student voice is important and
helps the school board and district determine how to make things better. We’re all proud
of those of you who have earned your diploma, as well as those who are in the process of
earning it.
Ms. Diaz Hackler also thanked everyone for attending and adjourned the meeting at 3:15
p.m.
