  3. Public Comment
A. Written Public Comments
Written comments, received via email, were provided to each director for review individually prior to the meeting.
  4. Reports
A. Enrollment Update
Due to the emergency closure of school facilities, and changes in reporting, enrollment reports were no longer available for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.
  B. Budget Status and Financial Report
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided a report of revenue and expenses for the month of May. She described how the district's revenue and expenses have differed this year due to the current pandemic-related facility closure. Although the district has not received food service payments from families, meal service has been provided daily on bus routes. There has also been no revenue from facility use by community groups. Ms. Porter does believe that the district will end the current fiscal year with a surplus which will provide a good starting point for next year. Director Thomas asked if surplus funds carry over to next year, and Ms. Porter explained that most funds do carry over, with the exception of funds that are dedicated to specific expenses which are lost if not used.
  C. 2020-21 Budget Planning Update
Amber Porter provided the board with an update on the 2020-21 Budget Planning process which still includes a lot of question marks. Although the state's budget for next year is set, and the district has not yet been informed of any changes to revenue formulas, she anticipates adjustments will be forthcoming. The legislature may be called to a special session to address budgetary shortfalls. Impacts to revenue could include reduced enrollment, delayed property tax payments, as well as the potential for arrears in tax payments as has been experienced in past recessions. Smaller revenue streams like facility use fees and food service payments are also likely to be reduced. There is uncertainty regarding expenses as well, including food and transportation costs. The state is aware of school districts' need to revise the formulas for both enrollment and transportation funding due to pandemic-related restrictions. The goal in budget development is to align revenue and expenditure levels for the year. An unanticipated, mid-year reduction in revenue could be detrimental because expenditures cannot be adjusted easily in response to the change. There is a potential for increased cost related to providing a flexible continuous learning program and responding to fluctuating requirements from the Health Department. However, the funds that are anticipated to carry over from the current school year may provide a source of stabilization.
  Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger commented on new athletic restrictions which were received from WIAA earlier in the day and will need to be reviewed. The district is also seeking survey input from families to inform decisions about filling vacancies or reallocating existing staffing resources. Special education and IEP programs are being evaluated independently.
  Ms. Porter described expectations for the district's other funds. Reductions in both activities and fundraising will be reflected in the ASB Fund. Larger capital projects work is winding down, and smaller jobs are currently underway. The Capital Projects Fund will continue to make interest payments as well as repayment of non-voted bonds. The Capital Projects Fund is also subject to the above-mentioned potential impacts related to property tax collection. The Transportation Fund is dependent upon continuation of revenue from the state. Expenses for the Debt Service Fund are predictable.
  A draft budget will be available by the July 10 deadline. The ESD will review the full F-195 along with the district's formal 4-year projection. An announcement will be published in the newspaper regarding availability of the draft budget and the public hearing at the board's July 27 meeting. The board will take action on adoption of the budget at the August 24 meeting, and Ms. Porter explained that the board approves the total dollar amount for each fund, but not the individual programming within those funds. Director McKinney asked what level of budget detail will be available for review and discussion followed.
  In summary, Ms. Porter expressed thankfulness for the district's current financial strength and ability to be flexible.
  D. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger began by expressing appreciation for Amber Porter's work throughout the past months in providing operational and financial support to the district's efforts in navigating the pandemic crisis. Dr. Granger also commented on the strength and resilience of the Blaine community and the work of multiple stakeholders that made the last part of 2019-20 a success.

Rolls of Field Turf have been delivered and will be laid down starting next week. This work is still slated for completion by the end of July. The track will also be re-painted so that the finish line will be in front of new grandstand.
  District administrators are working in preparation for the 2020-2021 school year to meet the needs of students. Needs will be assessed as they arise on a case by case basis for each school and department, utilizing internal capacity before filling positions. This is especially important with the uncertainty around next school year. At this time, it is known that two additional daytime custodians will be needed to address cleaning needs throughout the day. Addition of a new accountant position in the District Office will be delayed until later.

Dr. Granger described the state's mandate to open schools in the fall while meeting requirements to limit disease transmission. Facial masks will be required for all staff and students, unless an exemption applies, and schools are authorized to exclude any staff or students who refuse to comply. The 6-foot social distancing requirement will limit the number of students that can be in a classroom. There was discussion regarding the logistics of maintaining 6-feet of distance, and Dr. Granger explained the Health Department's definition of contact is 6-feet or less for 10 minutes or more. Dr. Granger explained that schools throughout the county have varying classroom sizes which means some schools may be able to have more students in each classroom. The district is currently working on the development of a hybrid plan as well as a robust online option. Planning will include focus groups of families and staff as well as survey input. The hybrid plan being considered at this time would involve alternating weeks of in-person instruction Monday-Thursday with online programming on all Fridays. Out of 10 days, students would spend 4 days in the school building and 6 days online at home. Most families who participated in the district's current survey have indicated a desire to remain in Blaine School District. There will continue to be a significant need for flexibility as changes come up or needs arise throughout the next year. Although the state has not yet provided a template for guidance, the board must approve the district's plan no less than two weeks prior to the start of school. If a plan is not available by July 27, then a special meeting will be called in August.
  There is potential for a special legislative session in the fall.
