  Reports: 4.1 Athletics Report, Dennis Bower
Mr. Bower gave a big thank you to Mrs. Padgett and her family as well as our maintenance crew, and Mr. Hoffman's students for refurbishing all the dugouts. Baseball is back this season with a new head coach Weylin Womack and asst coach Spencer Hamilton. Both have been recruiting to put together a great team.
With the scoreboards and dugouts, the season will have a fresh start.
  Brenda Padgett, Superintendent 
The first safety committee meeting happened this month. The focus is on safety as whole for the District. Looking at the big and small pictures of what needs to be updated or fixed or added. AED's were on the agenda. It was discussed who else to have on the committee.
As a District we are working on a plan of do more with less. Digging into budget numbers and meetings with admin & their secretaries to save more money and planning for next year's budget.
  5. RECOGNITIONS/PRESENTATIONS
  Discussion, Procedural: 5.1 Presentation- Kevin Hoffman
Mr. Hoffman's Aquaculture class was 1 of 2 schools that presented at the NW Fish Culture Conference. There were agencies from all over including New Mexico, California, and Utah to name a few.
Taden Miller gave us his take aways from the trip. It gave him a new perspective on what it would be like to get into the industry. A lot less manual labor than he thought. He expressed that it is a great opportunity to have Aquaculture as a class in our School.
  6. Student Rep Reports
  Reports: 6.1 Student Rep Report - David Locklin
The resurgence in involvement of the students is the most he has seen in all his years in school. Wrestling had a larger and more skilled team. There is active growth in multiple programs. It is impactful to see the growth and change in Baseball.
He believes this resurgence has been because of new management, as in Mr. Pilloud and Mrs. Padgett. And having no more lockdowns.
  7. FINANCIAL REPORTS
  Reports: 7.1 Financial Report - Kathleen Ahmann, Business Manager
We ended the month with a positive ending fund balance of $142,070.04 with the treasurer's  office. Our enrollment for February was 823.26 which gave us 8.26 FTE over our budgeted FTE. Enrollment increase will increase our revenues which will reflect in our apportionment and increase our ending fund balance.
  8. BOARD REPORTS/COMMENTS
The Board thanked the Padgett family, maintenance, and Mr. Hoffman's class's for refurbishing the dugouts. The community has asked the Board about a memorial for Mr. Kinsman and it will be done by our National Honor Society in the fall possibly. 
Legislation is in session until Friday. ESB 5462 did pass in committee today. There will be some funding bills that would be great for the district.
