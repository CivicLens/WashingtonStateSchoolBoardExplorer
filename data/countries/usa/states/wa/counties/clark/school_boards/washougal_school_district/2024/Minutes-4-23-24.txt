4. Informational Presentations
A. Discuss Superintendent Vacancy & Next Steps
Board Director Angela Hancock thanked Mary Templeton for her six years of service and shared that she has taken a
position with Lake Stevens School District. She stated that being this late in the school year, there is not time to do an
extensive search which takes several months to gather community input, collect and screen applicants and then to
interview. We may have an internal employee who can fill in in the interim giving the board the capacity to run a
thoughtful process next fall with opportunities for the community to weigh in on the qualities and attributes we are
seeking. Superintendent Templeton shared heart-felt gratitude for the opportunity to be Washougal's superintendent.
She said we have been through a lot and continue to work together during these challenging times. She thanked the
staff present.

5. Proposals for Action & Comments
A. Citizen Comments Specific to Action Items Below
None.
B. Approval to Discuss Contract Terms with Employee
Jim Cooper moved to approve the board president to discuss contract terms with an employee to be the interim
superintendent, and Sadie McKenzie seconded. The motion carried unanimously.
C. Resolution 2023-24-03: Modified Education Program
Superintendent Templeton shared the process that has been ongoing for over a year and the difficult decisions that
have had to be made due to the budget shortfall. She said there is a lot of pressure and responsibility to be able to
pay the bills and she thanked the Washougal community, the district office staff and the district office administrators
as well as building administrators who have agreed to pay freezes and cuts. She also thanked the community, parents
and students who have stood up and expressed their support and concerns and the district listened. Mary addressed
the possibility of a second round of cuts and said that remains to be seen. Several factors will determine that: the
legislature, increase in utility costs, lower enrollment, and two open contracts.
Sadie Mckenzie moved to approve Resolution 2023-24-03, and Ida Royer seconded. The motion passed unanimously.
6. Comments
A. Comments - Board of Directors
Jim Cooper thanked everyone for attending and said other districts are also experiencing shortfalls and his goal is to
keep the state from taking over our finances.
Sadie McKenzie also thanked everyone for coming. She said the Stride is coming and volunteers are still needed.
Ida Royer thanked everyone for still getting up and going to work for our kids.
Angela Hancock expressed the stress she feels over the loss of positions and we are all a community so it is felt
deeply. She shared her appreciation for all the hard work all staff does for our students and for Representative Waters'
visit to see what is happening in our schools. She also congratulated the finance team for a clean audit for the sixth
year in a row and reminded everyone that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is coming up as well as Kindergarten
Open Houses on May 15th.
B. Superintendentâ€™s Update
Mary deferred to Assistant Superintendent Aaron Hansen who said prom was Saturday night and close to 350 students
participated and it was a wonderful event. He thanked all the staff who took the time to decorate and the CTE
Department who provided amazing snacks.
Director of Teaching and Learning Tracey MacLachlan thanked the board and Representative Waters for attending the
WHS site visit. It was a wonderful opportunity to see the students in action. She said she is looking forward to the
last site visit to CRGE in May.
C. Citizen Comments - General
Jay Bennett, WAE president, spoke of the upcoming cuts and said the district has chosen to cut certificated staff at
double the rate of administration. He said in the second round of cuts, the district is again looking to cut teachers and
their cost of living raises and not one administrator. He challenged the board to ask questions and push back.
Connie Vernon said they are here tonight to make sure you are hearing from all the stakeholders and if you are being
told there is only one choice, she hopes you will reach out to other stakeholders to see there are other options
because the WAE is not feeling heard. Reducing classified and certified staff to bare minimums and then cutting their
cost of living increases is not the answer.
Rebecca Woodings shared that she has lived in this community all her life, graduated from WHS and has taught here
many years, through good times and bad. With the lower enrollment and lack of funding, the need for cuts is clear but
when the community was asked, they said they wanted teachers and classified staff cut less and to cut from
administration but the district is doing the opposite and now want to also cut their cost of living raise.
J
osie Barrett, 3rd grade teacher, spoke on behalf of other staff who are not comfortable speaking and said they want to
know why the superintendent was given a raise. There are no cuts at the district office, which is furthest from the
classroom. If there are fewer students, why does there need to be the same number of district office staff and why do
they need to be year round when the students aren't.

Alison McGranahan, a nineteen year teacher in WSD, expressed her stress in the changes of social and emotional
challenges in her students and staff is working hard to address these challenges, but it is taking away from the actual
teaching. She is concerned that the cuts are directly affecting the very staff who support these students. She
encouraged the school board to ask the questions and see if there are other ways to solve the budget crisis.
7. Future Agenda Items
Angela Hancock requested a special meeting on April 30th to discuss an interim superintendent.
8. Board Evaluation
The evaluation form is available online for board members to complete.
9. Adjourn
Sadie McKenzie moved to adjourn at 7:10 p.m., and Ida Royer seconded. The motion carried unanimously.
