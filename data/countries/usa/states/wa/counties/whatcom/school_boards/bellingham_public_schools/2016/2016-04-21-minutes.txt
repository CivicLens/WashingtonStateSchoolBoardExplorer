Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler, Quenby Peterson,

Audience – No audience presented
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
 Start and End Times – Responses to the decision regarding changes to start and end
times beginning 2017-18 have been minimal. A community informational meeting at
Whatcom Middle School, held on April 13, was attended by two elementary parents
and two journalism students. Dr. Gass was there to discuss the medical aspect. The
parents who attended said they appreciated our time and because of the meeting, they
said they had a better understanding of the rationale. The topic was also discussed at a
recent Parent Advisory Committee (PAC) meeting, and reaction was muted. It
appears the community is in a good place in terms of this decision.
 High School 4x8 Schedules – The superintendent’s office has received mostly
positive responses to the high school schedule update. Jeannie Hayden, assistant
principal at Sunnyland Elementary School, will transition to a new facilitator role this
summer and will support the four high schools as they move to a common schedule.
 Transportation Levy Planning Advisory Group – This group met for the first time on
April 20. It is comprised of students, parents, principals, transportation staff, and
community members. Their charge is to review data on our aging fleet, consider the
need for additional buses, and recommend levy priorities and a levy amount. The
group is expected to submit a recommendation to the superintendent by early June.
 New Options High School – An informational meeting for Sunnyland neighbors was
held on April 18. Of the 20 or so attendees, a few cited concerns but the remainder
seemed to be there to simply hear more about the project. The district continues to
work closely with the city. A public hearing will take place on May 18 at City Hall to
consider the district’s application for a conditional use permit.
 Personnel Announcements: The following administrative appointments have been
made effective with the 2016-17 school year:
o Katie Ruthford: Assistant Principal, Squalicum High School
o Marty Atkins: Assistant Principal, Sehome High School
