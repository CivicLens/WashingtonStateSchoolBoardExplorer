2nd Reading Revised Policy 2190 - Highly Capable Programs:

Policy revised to clarify that the law does not mandate the screening of all students. Instead, school
districts are now required to universally screen students only at two elementary grade levels, rather than
screening all K-12 students annually. And added the requirement for the use of multiple objective criteria
and multiple pathways in the identification and placement decisions.
Procedure revised to comply with program placement procedures:
Referral: The district is to conduct universal screenings at two elementary grade levels to identify
students who may qualify for potential placement in the Highly Capable Program (HCP).
Screening: Universal screening must take place once in or before second grade, and again before
leaving elementary school, either in fifth or sixth grade.

Assessment: The district is now required to obtain written parental permission before conducting
additional assessments to determine eligibility for participation in the Highly Capable Program (HCP).
Furthermore, districts must use multiple objective criteria to identify students determined to b in need
of services.
Exit Process: The exit process now mandates that parents/guardians be involved in the exit meeting.
