----- Written Comment(s) ----1.<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Joseph Moriarty:<!--td {border:
1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->I'm hoping that the School Board will support the
contracting of a third party, non-bias auditor to identify how the district can improve its stewardship of our limited resources.
Conducting a forensic audit will also enhance community trust and satisfy the call for transparency.
