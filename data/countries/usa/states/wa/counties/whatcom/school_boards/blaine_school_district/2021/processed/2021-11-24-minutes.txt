  2. Action Items
A. Resolution 2122-06 Certification of 2022 Excess Property Taxes
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided a recommendation that the board adopt Resolution 2122-06 to certify an increase in the Replacement Maintenance & Operations levy collection for calendar year 2022 to a level equal to the District's maximum legal levy authority which is $6,082,990. This revises and replaces the amount of $5,909,503 which was originally projected in the 2021-22 Budget. It is also less than the amount of $6,400,000 which voters authorized for collection in 2022. The deadline to certify this adjustment is November 30, 2021.

Ms. Porter explained how the "excess" levy is collected from property owners as a fixed amount divided equally based upon property value. As property values rise, the "excess" levy's amount per thousand goes down. Although voters approved a higher collection amount, the state legislature has capped the amount the district can collect. Ms. Porter further explained how the 2021-22 Budget revenue was calculated and why that number has changed based upon a recent OSPI update. Although the increased revenue is not needed for current programming costs, the district is continuing to save in anticipation of future budget shortfalls. Director Thomas summarized what he learned from researching this issue. Director McKinney expressed concern that voters will lose trust in the district and will remember this tax increase when considering approval of future levies. She described how the overall amount paid by voters will still increase even though the cost per thousand goes down. Ms. Porter shared the district's concern about future funding loss, particularly when stimulus revenue is no longer available. Expectations for increased staffing costs were discussed. Director McKinney stated that the potential negative impact to the district's image in the community outweighs the benefit of saving for future potential budget shortfalls. President Gibson expressed a preference for incremental tax increases over large increases in the future. Director Nunamaker clarified that the increase would still be under the amount approved by voters. Director Thomas commented on teachers' use of personal funds for needs in the classroom and discussion continued.
  There was further discussion about the pros and cons of this matter. Dr. Granger and Ms. Porter informed the board that the district has historically budgeted its revenue to maximize the levy cap. Not doing so now would be a deviation from past practice and would require further review of the practice in future budget planning. The board considered the need for more time to consider this matter, and Ms. Porter reminded them of the county's November 30 deadline. Director McKinney indicated that opinions are not likely to change over the holiday weekend and all agreed to take action at this meeting.
  The board voted to adopt Resolution 2122-06 Certification of 2022 Excess Property Taxes.
