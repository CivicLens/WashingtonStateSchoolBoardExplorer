regarding policy governance. The WWU students are current teachers participating
in an administrative program.
CONSENT ITEMS: Ms. Peterson said an immediate family member is working with
two firms (Dawson Construction and Dykeman Architecture) that the district has retained
for the Sehome High School construction project. To avoid a conflict of interest per
RCW 42.23.030, she said it is therefore necessary for her to recuse herself from voting on
Item 2.13 (approval of Sehome High School Construction Change Order). She then made
a motion to vote on Item 2.13 separately. the other board members concurred.

Prior to voting on the consent agenda, Mr. Benjamin said he wanted to acknowledge the
recent generous support of the Sustainable Whatcom Fund of Whatcom Community
Foundation, which included a $1,000,000 grant to support the new Bellingham School
District central kitchen.
Additionally, Mr. Benjamin said the board should formally express appreciation to the
members of the finance and operations team whose professionalism and dedication was
recognized by the state auditor during the recent presentation of the Stewardship Award
