bond proceedings are going quite well. He opened the conversation with an
update on the secure vestibule projects in our buildings. He said most of the
construction is completely finished. They are completing final touch ups on those
projects.
Mr. Deebach said the high school project is still wrapping up the design
development. He said over the last three weeks the big project has been for all
the consultants to review the plans in detail and bring up any questions or

concerns that anyone has on their mind. Now Cornerstone, GCCM and
Dykeman are going through the thousand questions/items that have come out of
the review and writing responses.
Mr. Deebach said the budget is tight between the design estimate and the actual
design documents with where they are at right now which is a really good sign.
Mr. Deebach said the latest development today is that there is a bid opening for
the ground movement. We received four bids. The bids numbers came in exactly
where the budget numbers said they should be.
Mr. Deebach answered questions from the board. He said we anticipate breaking
ground next summer and we are on schedule.
Mr. McLaurin reminded viewers that they can find more information about the
bond and the work of the Bond Oversight Committee on the district website. In
addition, Dr. Quinn publishes weekly bond updates every Friday, and you can
sign up to have them sent directly to your email.
5.02 Update on the Levy Campaign
Superintendent Dr. Linda Quinn gave an update on the Levy Campaign. She
said we have been busy getting the last pieces of the information campaign done
this week. She said that Jay Julius and Children of the Setting Sun Productions
are making short informational videos and interviewing people within the
community.
Dr. Quinn said we are putting out one mailer, which is at the print shop. We plan
to mail that in 10-12 days. She said we have been putting a few informational
post on the website, which have been shared on Facebook.

meetings. Lee Anne will be starting tomorrow evening. She said we will have

Mr. McLaurin reminded audience members that the November 3 election is 5
weeks from today and ballots are scheduled to be mailed out 2 weeks from
today. He encourages everyone to vote.
5.03 Report on and Discussion of the First Quarter of the 2020-2021 School Year
Superintendent Dr. Linda Quinn shared a PowerPoint presentation, which can be
found on BoardDocs. The PowerPoint shared metrics from the Health
Department, gave an update on the first 19 days of school, reported on
enrollment, which is down from last year, and gave an update on when we will
be able to start bringing students back in for in-person learning.
Dr. Quinn answered questions from the board and asked for feedback regarding
returning to in-person learning. The board agreed it is best to move forward
slowly with bringing students back to in-person learning for the health and
safety of our staff and students.
Mr. McLaurin said we will be discussing this further and would like Dr. Quinn
to keep the board updated on the plans for bringing students back to in-person
learning.
Ms. Cool asked Cuong and Avneet what their thoughts were on distance
learning. Cuong said that online school is okay but he has more schoolwork now
than in-person learning. Avneet said that everyone would like to be back to inperson school as soon as possible. She also agreed with the board that when we
bring students back to in-person learning, we should wait more than one week in
between bringing back each grade level.
5.04 Discussion Regarding the Use of the Financial Advisor for Bond Sales
Mr. McLaurin asked Mr. Deebach to begin the conversation by answering the
following question: what did the financial advisor do and how helpful was his
support?

Ferndale School District No. 502
School Board Regular Meeting Minutes September 29, 2020
Assistant Superintendent for Business & Support Services Mark Deebach
reported that the financial advisor attended all the pre-planning meetings,
reviewed all documents from bond council and from our financial folks,
attended the day of pricing and worked with D.A. Davidson on the day of
pricing. He was right alongside us throughout the whole process of the sale.
Mr. McLaurin asked in terms of process and outcome, did he impact the sale
price or bring anything to the table that got us a better deal.
Mr. Deebach said no he didn’t do anything that resulted in a better outcome but
where the value was is that he confirmed what we were doing is right. He
confirmed that the pricing that D.A. Davidson provided us was the best that it
could be. He confirmed that we were getting the best deal we possibly could for
our taxpayers.
There was a brief discussion amongst the board.
Ms. Cool said the biggest value is having the validation that what we are doing is
right and for our community to see that.
The next bond sale will be next year. There will be further discussion with the
Bond Oversight Committee regarding the use of the financial advisor.
6. MATTERS RESERVED FOR BOARD ACTION
6.01 Adopt Resolution 22-2020 District Reopening–Suspension of Policy
Mr. McLaurin said this is a policy strongly recommended to us by WSSDA. He
reminded the audience that the Board passed a similar policy at the beginning of
the pandemic and that this one essentially extends the sunset date.
Lee Anne Riddle moved to adopt resolution 22-2020 District Reopening–
Suspension of Policy as attached hereto and made a part of the minutes.

7. SHARING [GC-7.E.]
7.01 Student Board Members
Cuong asked when the schools go back to in-person and distance learning; will
the teachers be back in classrooms fully? Cuong said he spoke with some friends
and family that were confused on how that was going to work.
Dr. Quinn explained that when we get to the hybrid model at the elementary
level, they will have their teachers in class full time for 2 days and then they will
do schoolwork online from home 3 days.
Avneet said nothing much has been happening as far as events. She said senior
talk has started and senior parent nights have been happening. She asked when
in-person learning happens, will students be getting their temperature checked.
Executive Director of Human Resources, Mr. Fairbairn explained that we will be
doing health attestations for each student. Each student will have to answer the
questions each day before going to school. That data is downloaded into
Skyward and accessible by the office staff at each school.
