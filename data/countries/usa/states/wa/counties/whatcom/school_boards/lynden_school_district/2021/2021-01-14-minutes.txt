2. Good News
• Fisher Elementary staff raised over $450 to donate to Lynden families being served through
Family Community Services.
• A Bernice Vossbeck teacher, is proud of how resilient her students have been upon returning to
the classroom. She has a classroom full of discussion, laughter and learning and happy children
who are growing academically and socially. It’s a joy to come to school for her and her students
and appreciates the administration for all the behind the scenes discussions and planning that
has happened to be able to teach in-person.
• A Bernice Vossbeck teacher would like to recognize the “VanDodd” team of Melissa VanDalen
and Joelle Dodd. Melissa and Joelle have been incredible supports and drivers of running our
intervention groups for reading and math as well as training our para-educators to run
intervention groups. Their work is making a tremendous difference in closing gaps and filling
holes in our students’ learning.
• A Bernice Vossbeck kindergarten teacher, shared the good news that her class is using their 1 to 1
