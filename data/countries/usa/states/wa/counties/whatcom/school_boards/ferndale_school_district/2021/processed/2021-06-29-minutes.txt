  ADOPTION OF AGENDA

  McLaurin moved to approve the agenda with the sole change of postponing Gonzales’ swearing-in.
The motion carried unanimously.
  MATTERS RESERVED FOR BOARD ACTION
Recognize Recipient of the WASA Community Service Award
President McLaurin introduced Chairman Lawrence Solomon and Dr. Justin Iwasaki of the Lummi Nation, who received the 2020-21 WASA Community Service Award for providing COVID-19 vaccines for Ferndale School District students and staff.
  Both McLaurin and Dr. Linda Quinn thanked the Lummi Nation for their generosity in providing vaccines to students and staff, months before they would have become eligible otherwise. This allowed in-person school to resume earlier and alleviated stress for staff, Dr. Quinn said.
Solomon and Iwasaki accepted the awards and thanked the school board in a brief speech.
  4. PUBLIC COMMENT [GC-3.3]
  There was no public comment submitted prior to the meeting.
  5. FOCUS ON STUDENTS
  5.01 Swear in Student School Board Member
This portion of the meeting was cancelled.
  5.02 Recognize Outstanding Senior Awards
Mr. McLaurin noted that it is a longstanding tradition for outstanding Ferndale High School graduates to be honored in-person at the May school board meeting. However, due to COVID-19, that tradition could not continue this year, he said.

Instead, board members took turns reading aloud the names of the 24 seniors who received Outstanding Senior Awards.
  5.03 Review the Monitoring Report for Results Policy R-6 Career Readiness
The Monitoring Report for Results Policy R-6 Career Readiness was given to the board at the May 25 school board meeting. The report was opened for discussion tonight.
  Board members agreed that preparing students for post-schooling careers was important for all grades and career interests, beyond solely offering traditional career and technical education, or CTE, classes at the high school level. Board members also made comments about offering even more career pathway options, and encouraging students to take these courses even if they weren’t interested in a career in those fields.
  Dr. Quinn pointed out that Cornerstone General Contractors – the construction team building the new Ferndale High School – plan to invite students onto the construction site for hands-on applications of math and science.
  The Board will vote on the policy report at its July 27 regular school board meeting.
  6. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
  6.01 Report on Capital Projects Bond
Mr. Mark Deebach told the Board that Cornerstone General Contractors has hired a local student from the Transitions program to help at the high school construction site.
  Beyond that, he listed many other recent signs of progress at the construction site for the Board. These included: adding a second drill rig at the site to dig through soil and clay, installing more Geopier structures to prop up the future high school’s foundation, and construction crews finding a buried fuel tank underneath the construction site and hiring a company to remove it and remediate the soil.
  Also, the City of Ferndale has agreed to start regular meetings with the high school construction team to smooth the construction process, Mr. Deebach said. The two groups’ first scheduled meeting will be June 30.
  Mr. Deebach said the district is preparing to sell the third series of bonds from the 2019 measure, and the school board will vote on that sale at the July 20 Special Board Meeting.
  6.02 Receive the Monitoring Report for Operational Expectations Policy 9 (OE-9) Learning Environment
Dr. Quinn presented the Monitoring Report for OE-9 Learning Environment. She noted that this is the second time the Board has reviewed this policy, meaning they’ve reviewed nearly every policy at least once.
  The report will be up for discussion at the July 27 Regular Board Meeting.
  Mr. McLaurin thanked Dr. Quinn and the administrative team for taking the time to prepare these monitoring reports.
  7. SHARING
  7.01 Student Board Members
Mr. Nguyen briefly spoke about his ThoughtExchange project, saying he was almost finished. He noted that about 230 Ferndale High School Students participated in his survey, and said he was surprised by the varying responses when students were asked what changes they’d like to see in their school.
  7.02 Elected Board Members
Ms. Riddle quickly described her two recent experiences with the Washington State School Director’s Association, or WSSDA. In particular, she said she was impressed with WSSDA’s webinar on equity and political divide, and she hoped that the school board would have a similar discussion soon.
