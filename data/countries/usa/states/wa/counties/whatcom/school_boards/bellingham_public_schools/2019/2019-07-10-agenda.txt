2.3 Resolution 7-19, Bond Issuance and
Sale

Meeting :

Jul 10, 2019 - Regular Board Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached Resolution 7-19 authorizing
the sale of bonds later this year. As noted below, this is a
"delegation resolution." As superintendent, I have reviewed
and fully support board adoption of this resolution.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
The attached resolution 7-19 authorizes the issuance and sale of unlimited tax general obligation bonds of the district in the aggregate
principal amount of not to exceed $50,000,000 to provide funds for the renovation, upgrade and new construction of school facilities of the
district, as authorized by Resolution No.25-17 of the boardand approved by the qualified electors of the district at a special election held on
February13, 2018, providing for annual tax levies to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds; and it delegatesto the superintendent of
the district the authority to determine the final structure and details of the bonds.
A'delegation resolution' grants temporaryauthority to the superintendent to approve the final structure, interest rates, maturity dates and
principal maturitiesassociated with the bonds and the authority to accept a bid for the sale of bonds. The advantage of a delegation
resolution is that it allows the district to quickly enter the bond market when conditions are favorable, adjust the structure of the bonds and
approve a bid,irrespective of the timing of a board meeting, within the bounds of the parameters established in the resolution. Without a
delegation resolution, the district's only option is to enter the bond market on the date of a regular or special board meeting which may or
may not be a date that is most advantageous to the district. You will notice several blanks throughout the document related to the form of
bonds and exhibits. These are provisions that will be determined as we get closer to the sale date. We will provide the board with a report
describing the final terms after the bonds are sold. We anticipate conducting the bond sale in the last week of August 2019.

2.4 Authorize Negotiations Architectural Services for
Sunnyland Elementary School Rebuild Project

Meeting :

Jul 10, 2019 - Regular Board Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted a request to begin contract negotiations
with Dykeman Group Architects for services related to the
replacement of Sunnyland Elementary School. As
superintendent, I have reviewed and approve this request.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
As part of the bond approved by voters on February 13, 2018, the existing Sunnyland Elementary School will be replaced with a
new facility.
RCW 39.80.040 governs the process for selecting architects. One option is to select a firm from an annual general request for
statements of qualifications from firms interested in providing such services.
After reviewing the statements of qualifications from firms who responded to our annual request, I believe Dykeman Group
Architects is best qualified to provide services for the Sunnyland Elementary School rebuild. Dykeman has provided outstanding
architectural services on a number of previous projects including Birchwood Elementary School, Lowell Elementary School,
Whatcom Middle School, Sehome High Schooland the Central Kitchen.They are currently working on the Alderwood Elementary
School project.
I am seeking your approval to begin contract negotiations with Dykeman Group Architects for services related to the Sunnyland
Elementary School rebuild project.

2.5 Approve Sale of West Maplewood Ave. Property
Parcel 380214406358

Meeting :

Jul 10, 2019 - Regular Board Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff is submitting a recommendation regarding the sale of
district property located on West Maplewood Avenue in
Bellingham. I have reviewed the request and am in support
of the recommendation.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:

We have two offers on the West Maplewood parcel. The first is a $141,000 cash offer from Sunny
Properties 1 LLC with a 70-day feasibility period contingency. The second is a $160,000 offer from
Kulshan Community Land Trust (KCLT), contingent on financing, and a 75-day feasibility period
contingency.
The feasibility period contingencies are ostensibly the same for both offers. Even though the KCLT offer
is contingent on them obtaining financing, it is the highest offer and therefore, I recommend you approve
the sale of this property to Kulshan Community Land Trust.
By approving this sale, the Board also authorizes the Superintendent to effectuate the closing of the sale
of the property and the transfer by deed of title to the property.

2.6 Approve Sale of 3314 E Sunset Drive (aka 1169 Mt.
Baker Highway) Property Parcel 380316378331

Meeting :

Jul 10, 2019 - Regular Board Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff is submitting a recommendation regarding the sale of
district property located on East Sunset Drive in
Bellingham. I have reviewed the request and am in support
of the recommendation.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
We received four offers on the Sunset Drive parcel. The first is a $395,000 cash offer with a no feasibility
period contingency from Matthew D. McCoy. The second is a $485,000 cash offer with a 60-day
feasibility period contingency from Sukhdeep Kaur. The third is a $485,000 cash offer with a 45-day
feasibility period contingency from Rodney Schenk. The fourth is a $470,000 cash offer with no feasibility
period contingency from Kang and Rendong Huang.
All offers are cash offers with no financing contingency.
The major distinguishing factor between the three highest offers is that the offer from Kang and Rendong
Huang has a 0-day feasibility period contingency meaning due diligence activities have been completed
and the sale can be closed as soon as possible. The other two offers include a feasibility period
contingency which could make them void.
While the Huang offer is $15,000 less than the Kuar and Schenk offers, it does not have any feasibility
period contingency and therefore I recommend you approve the sale of this property to Kang and
Rendong Huang.

By approving this sale, the Board also authorizes the Superintendent to effectuate the closing of the sale
of the property and the transfer by deed of title to the property.
