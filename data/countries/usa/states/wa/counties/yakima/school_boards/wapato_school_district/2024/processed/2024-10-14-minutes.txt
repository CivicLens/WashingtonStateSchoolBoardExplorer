Superintendent's Report: Kelly Garza, Superintendent, reported:
Two Wapato HS students have been selected to serve on the OSPI Migrant Student Advisory Council. They are Juniors Karen and Hailey Trejo. Most of their participation will be via virtual meetings and in the Spring they will visit OSPI and meet with Superintendent Rykdell.
Last week was the 1st Dinner Parent Engagement night. The event provided Language and Literacy Information and hosted more than 300 people. The night featured breakout sessions managed by Administrative Interns of interactive parent and student engagement regarding data and assessment. Mr. Garza was pleased with the great attendance and thanked all administrators that play a role in the planning, organizing and making the event a success such as Shawn Thurman and Mike Balmelli.
He had the opportunity to stop by the WELCOME Preschool Fall Experience Day last week on Thursday. He said the event was huge success and Ken Olden will provide more details during his report. Mr. Garza thanked all who volunteered.
He attended the Filipino Hall community event on Saturday. The event celebrated the national recognition of the Filipino Hall as a Historic Site. Ben Newell and Maria Batarao joined Mr. Garza along with many other community members. The program featured traditional Filipino food and dances, specifically performances by Wapato Students. Mr. Garza shared a publication distributed at the event with historical data and information about the site.
Construction Update - Kevin Hill, Executive Director,  was not present and Superintendent Garza reported on his behalf.
The replacement of the WHS well is projected to cost $980,000. The District has submitted for a grant to help cover the cost of the necessary project. The Department of Commerce has fallen behind schedule and is expected to announce recipients on October 20th. However, the District is prepared to move forward with the project with or without the grant. The Board engaged in discussion with Sylvia Bazan regarding cost and funding for the project. She said the well is a priority and must get completed regardless of grant and provided financial solutions if grant is not awarded. The District is hopeful and awaiting the announcement of grant recipients to make financial decisions.
The District has received a draft of Ed Specs for the proposed square footage of the new PACE HS building is 23,278 sq. ft. He noted, Wapato Online Academy will continue to be housed at PACE. He talked about what is included and the possible different classroom sizes and other rooms such as the gym, more student bathrooms, redesign of the locker room and more bleacher seating. He reported Javier Rodriguez, Kevin Hill, and our HVAC Team will meet this week with ALCS Architect and Absher Construction to review mechanical and electrical systems for PACE. Mr. Garza reported the next PACE Design Team meeting is on Wednesday at the District office at 4:30pm. The Board engaged in discussion regarding wanting to see the final specifications and or view/walk the site to help envision the new school and size.
Mr. Garza informed the District is still working on the final contract recommendation with the Architect and Construction. The tentative agreement is currently pending review by District legal counsel to assure the needs of the district are met.
