he Board is grateful to receive public comment and appreciates the thoughtful input of its community. Because of the limitations of the
Boards calendar, Public Comment is generally limited to 20 minutes per meeting. If you would like to address the Board on an issue, please
limit your remarks to not more than 2 minutes. To maximize the number of comments we can hear, please use only the time you need to
make your statement. You may provide written documentation to the Board Secretary to be included as part of the official record. The Board
will listen to all comments carefully but will generally not respond to comments spontaneously or without further deliberation.
The meeting chair may terminate an individual's statement when the allotted time has passed. Although this can be disappointing, please
consider that this is to enable the maximum number of comments to be heard and that there are numerous additional ways to share
feedback with the Board and the district.
The meeting chair may also interrupt a speaker to require the same standard of civility that the Board imposes on itself. Examples of uncivil
comments include comments that:
Are libelous or slanderous;
Are an unwarranted invasion of privacy;
Are obscene or indecent pursuant to the Federal Communications Act or any rule or regulation of the Federal Communications Commission;
Violate school district policy or procedure related to harassment, intimidation, bullying, or discrimination;
Incite an unlawful act on school premises or violate a lawful school regulation; or
Create a material and substantial disruption of the orderly operation of the Board meeting.
The Board as a whole has the final decision in determining the appropriateness of all such rulings and can maintain order by removing those
who are disruptive. The Board recognizes, however, the distinction between uncivil discourse, which it will not tolerate, and comments about
the Board, district, and/or staff that are negative yet still civil in nature and will exercise its authority to maintain order in a content-neutral
manner.
The Board has a dedicated email address (Board@bsd405.org) and voicemail (425-456-4270) for receiving communication in the senders'
language of choice that is distributed/transcribed to all Board directors and logged with staff.
