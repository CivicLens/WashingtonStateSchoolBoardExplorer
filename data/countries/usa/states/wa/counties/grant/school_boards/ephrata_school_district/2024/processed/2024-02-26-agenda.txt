d. Approve Bid for New Storage Building
Presenter: Adam Roduner
We recently requested and received bids for a 40 X 100 ft. storage facility to be built on the school district property that is directly to the east and
across Frey Rd. to the EHS soccer fields.
After reviewing the bids that were received, we recommend to the board that Exco LLC's bid be accepted. Their bid stood out as a comprehensive
and competitive bid. Their bid scored highest amongst the bids received and showed a clear understanding of the storage facilities requirements.
Exco LLC's bid also showed a commitment to delivering exceptional value with the total cost of the storage facility being $223,450 + tax and also
provided a reasonable construction timeline of beginning in March and, pending potential weather and/or material delays, being completed by the
end of May.
Funding for this facility was included in the Capital Levy that was approved by voters in November of 2022.
