2. STUDY SESSION
Review of District's 2000s Policies
e Policy 2170- Presented by Melissa Rohr
Policy was last revised in 1989.
Updated from Vocational Education to CTE.
OSPI use to require a 5-year plan now it’s a 4-year plan.
Policy ensures that programs reflect what is going on in our current labor market and that it
is rigorous education.
Questions/Comments:

e Dr. Crawford- Is there anything in the policy that is different than what we are
currently doing? Melissa- No.
e President Rotter- What is the plan referenced in paragraph 3? Melissa- The plan is
what I submit every August/September.
e President Rotter - Is anything in here unique to us not just WSSDA
recommendations? Melissa- No.
e President Rotter- Do you feel that there is still anything lacking? Melissa- no, this is
pretty specific.
e

Policy 2413- Presented by Melissa Rohr
This policy use to only be about the equivalency credits for CTE, now it’s about all credits
available. This is almost completely new and none of the original policy stands.
Policy now includes experiential educational opportunities. Students would have to create a
proposal to get experiential credits.
Current law states that all statewide equivalency courses have to be recognized.
Mastery and competency-based credits- if students feel that they have the skills and
knowledge, the policy it lays out how they would go about not taking the course.
e Elective credit for paid work experience- up to 2 credits for students 16 or older,
any work they do they can earn credits. Students would need to submit who the

employer is and narrative. The work experience has to meet financial education
experience.
e

Questions/Comments:

e Director Dubos- Can you give an example of how they can meet financial
education experience? Melissa- Counting money, budgeting, how to read a
paycheck.
e President Rotter - Is this Policy just what WSSDA recommends? Melissa
Rohr- Our policy includes what credits we will offer at Bremerton School
District.

e President Rotter-Page 3 last bullet needs to come down.
e President Rotter-Page 2 the paragraph that states “The district team shall
include...” is missing “Teaching and learning team” at the end.
e President Rotter-Section 3- isn’t there another policy on the books around
this? Is it cross referenced in here? Do they align? Iva Scott- Yes there is,
and they align. We can make sure it is referenced.
e President Rotter- Do we anticipate a mass influx of utilization causing more
work for the district and giving the students enough credits to graduate
early? Melissa Rohr- No, we are trying to free up time in their schedules so
they can do things like AVID and internships.
e President Rotter- Page 2- 3 is new language- was this not happening before?
Melissa Rohr-we are changing the courses so that it meets the content area
they are going for.
e Director Hurley- How much is the exam for competency? Melissa Rohr- If
locally created, its free. We believe our students shouldn't have to pay but
there may be a test we aren't aware of that could incur a cost.
e Computer Science will be mandated next session as a graduation requirement, so we need
to prepare for what that looks like in the high school (staffing needs etc).
e Policy 2195- Presented by Cynthia Cantwelle The district is retiring Policy 2423 and replacing it with Policy 2195.
e This policy says that once a student is competent in a course, they will automatically be
enrolled in next rigorous course.
e Questions/Comments:
e President Rotter- Do we have the capacity to do this from a course scheduling
perspective? Example- if honors English is the same time as Orchestra, then the
student has to choose. We should be careful of binding language if we cannot make
this happen.
e Counselors should be reviewing the schedules and having a conversation with
students if they are not selecting the most rigorous course. Will this cause a capacity
issue? That is a lot of case management for counselors.
e Metric- number of students taking advanced courses.
e Policy 2163- Presented by Cynthia Cantwelle This policy was revised to add in parent involvement and our essential standards language.
WSSDA does not have a new version yet. It is predicted that there is an update coming so just
a few revisions were made until we get the revision from WSSDA.
e

Policy 2104- Presented by Kelsey McCreary for Julie Fairalle The changes that were made to this policy are mostly additions to call out Title 1 and
looking at funding and programs from an equity lens. The policy calls out the need for highly
capable services and that Title 1 services must be in addition to regular programming.

Questions/Comments:

language?

Kelsey McCreary-

I believe so.

board needs to be capitalized. Change ensures to promotes.

Policy 2108- Presented by Kelsey McCreary for Julie Fairall- e The Policy was formally “Remediation Programs”.
e Supports can now be more inclusive, and students can be served in multiple programs (such
as IEP and LAP) and it includes details to use LAP funding.
e Director Hurley- should it be PK-12 since we have district funded PK programs. Do we use
LAP funds in PK?
e Dr. Crawford- What other policies are related to community partnerships. They should be
cross referenced.

e

Policy 2107- Presented by Kelsey McCreary e This policy is in regard to a comprehensive early literacy plan.
e BSD didn't have a policy around early literacy, so this is a new policy.
e The model policy aligns with current practices.
e Policy states that we need to monitor and update families on early literacy progress.
e Reading interventions must be selected from an approved menu of research-based practice
and that we must share those interventions with parents so they can support them at home as
well.
e Questions/Comments
e President Rotter- Is our report card in that format? Can we actually show the progress
on the report card. Kelsey McCreary- It can be included in the narrative section but is
every teacher using it that way?

e

Policy 2421- Presented by Kelsey McCreary for Julie Fairalle This policy needed to update to be reflective of our values and beliefs that all of our students
should receive instruction at their grade level and receive interventions.
e We need a clear process and procedure for the retention of any student to be developed by
T&L
e

Questions/Comments:

e 2nd paragraph-remove except in these.
e Last paragraph needs revisions to make sense.
e Director Hurley- Will the procedure lay out individualization of interventions and
not just pushing kids through?
e Director Dubos- There is an accountability piece for the school board to ensure this
doesn't happen.
