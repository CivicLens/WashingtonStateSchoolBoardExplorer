Public Content
The scope of contract 23-06, Sidewalks 2023, provided for the following:
Schedule A sidewalk maintenance addressing the northern section of Pioneer Hill
(between Main Street and Derby Street), consisting of the removal and replacement of
select existing sidewalk panels (298 square yards) and occasional concrete curb and
gutter (76 linear feet), along with grinding of raised sidewalk panel edges (348 linear feet).
In addition, $1,680 of concrete workassociated with the emergency downtown traffic
signal repair at Kamiaken/Main was processed under Schedule A, Bid Item 14,
Miscellaneous Time and Material.
Schedule B sidewalk maintenance outside the northern section of Pioneer Hill, in
miscellaneous locations scattered throughout Pullman. Schedule B work pertained

activities (for example, replacement of sidewalk disturbed during water service or other
utility repairs).
The Contractor for this project was Knox Concrete, LLC. All work under the contract was
accepted as physically complete effective September 29, 2023. As of January 24, 2024, all
necessary closing paperwork has been received from the Contractor to allow for formal
acceptance of contract completion by City Council.The final contract amount is $103,685.00,

which is a 2.9% decrease from the original bid amount of $106,830.00. The difference stems
primarily from savings realized between actual versus estimated quantities for the Schedule B
work.A copy of the Final Estimate of Work Completed is attached for reference. The project was
funded from the Street Fund, Water and Sewer Maintenance Budgets of the Utility Fund, and the
Stormwater Fund.

By motion, accept contract 23-07, Bishop Blvd
Resurfacing 2023, as complete.

The scope of contract 23-07, Bishop Blvd Resurfacing 2023, consisted of a 2-inch grind and hot
mix asphalt overlay on Bishop Blvd from Fairmount Drive to just west of State Route 270.
Resurfacing targeted the main travel lanes, with select treatment only of the existing two-way leftturn lane. Work included approximately 2,200 tons of hot mix asphalt paving, 17,200 square
yards of pavement grinding, 4,300 linear feet of crackfilling, and miscellaneous striping, utility
cover adjustments, and concrete sidewalk and curb ramp construction.
The Contractor for this project was Motley-Motley, Inc. All work under the contract was accepted
as physically complete effective August 31, 2023. As of January 19, 2024, all necessary closing
paperwork has been received from the Contractor to now allow for formal acceptance of contract
completion by City Council.The final contract amount is $760,771.79, which is a 4.9% decrease
from the original bid amount of $799,801.00. This cost savings was due to the minimal need for
roadway foundation repair work, which was an unknown variable until the grinding operation was
completed and the resulting surface could be evaluated for deficiencies in the field. Reasonable
estimates were made as placeholders in the contract, but actual needs ended up much lower for
related bid items (10, 12, 15, and 23).
A copy of the Final Estimate of Work Completed is attached for reference. The project was
funded from the Street Fund, with approximately 82% of eligible project costs covered by a
Transportation Improvement Board Grant (totaling to $619,867 with inclusion of reimbursements
for design and construction engineering costs).

Public Content
The scope of contract 22-03, Marys Park Parking Lot, consisted of installing a new hot mix
asphalt (HMA) parking lot and related features at Marys Park. Work involved approximately 890
cubic yards of excavation (including haul), 310 tons of HMA paving, and 1,600 tons of crushed
surfacing top course placement and compaction. Striping and signage was required in the
contract to develop 28 parking stalls, 4 of which are ADA van accessible. In addition, installation

construction of concrete curb, biofiltration swale, inclusion of temporary erosion and sediment
control measures, and landscape restoration.

the Final Estimate of Work Completed is attached for reference. The project was funded from

Public Content
The scope of contract 23-11B, Kamiaken Waterline Replacement, included various construction
activities associated with installation of new 8-inch waterline necessary as a result of the April 9,
2023 water main break located within the South Fork of the Palouse River (SFPR) near the
Kamiaken Street bridge. This contract was executed on June 23, 2023, between the City of
Pullman and Apollo, Inc., as authorized by the April 10, 2023, emergency declaration by then
Pullman Mayor Glenn A. Johnson.

As detailed in the executed contract (attached for reference), the City intended to also contract
directly with a separate contractor specializing in horizontal directional drilling (HDD). That
contractor would complete the actual HDD/boring and installation of new HDPE water main
beneath the SFPR, with Apollo, Inc. responsible for all other supporting work (traffic control;
erosion and sedimentation control measures; clearing and grubbing; excavation, haul, and
disposal; PVC waterline installation via open trench methods; storm sewer repair; landscape and
roadway restoration; crushed surfacing procurement and placement; and removal of existing
broken cast iron water main within the river).
The contract provided for work by Apollo, Inc. to be performed on a time and material basis per
agreed-upon unit prices and in accordance with our City of Pullman Standard Construction
Specifications regarding Force Account work. Funding for this project came from the Water
Budget of the Utility Fund.

Public Content
Contract 23-11B, Kamiaken Waterline Replacement, included various construction activities
associated with installation of new 8-inch waterline necessary as a result of the April 9, 2023
water main break located within the South Fork of the Palouse River (SFPR) near the Kamiaken
Street bridge. This contract was executed on June 23, 2023, between the City of Pullman and
Apollo, Inc., as authorized by the April 10, 2023, emergency declaration by then Pullman Mayor
Glenn A. Johnson.
At the time of contract execution with Apollo, Inc., the City intended to also contract directly with
a separate contractor (Alltech Directional Boring, Inc.) specializing in horizontal directional
drilling (HDD). That contractor would complete the actual HDD/boring and installation of new
HDPE water main beneath the SFPR, with Apollo, Inc. responsible for all other supporting work
(traffic control; erosion and sedimentation control measures; clearing and grubbing; excavation,
haul, and disposal; PVC waterline installation via open trench methods; storm sewer repair;
landscape and roadway restoration; crushed surfacing procurement and placement; and
removal of existing broken cast iron water main within the river).
By early July, it was apparent that Alltech Directional Boring, Inc. would be unable to satisfy
insurance and paperwork requirements needed for contract execution in the short time-frame
available. City staff responded by working directly with Apollo, Inc., who was willing to secure a
different HDD contractor (as a subcontractor to them as the prime contractor) as needed to
complete that particular aspect of work. This change order modifies the original contract with
Apollo, Inc. to include all work previously contemplated to be completed by Alltech Directional
Boring, Inc. In addition, the original contract time for completion of the project was modified
accordingly. See the attached Change Order No. 1 for reference and a full description of all
contract changes. Funding for this project was from the Water Budget of the Utility Fund.

Recommended Action :

Staff recommends a motion to approve the resolution
extending the sunset date of the moratorium on
enforcement of electric scooters and bicycles until
December 31, 2024.

Public Content
At the August 8, 2023, City Council meeting, Resolution R-38-23 was approved,
which placed a moratorium on the enforcement of Pullman City Code sections related
to motorized scooters and bicycles. Resolution R-38-23 is attached for reference. The
YouTube video of that meeting can be found at the 34:10 mark located here:(10)
2023-08-08 Pullman City Council Meeting - YouTube.
Staff is recommending that the moratorium on the enforcement of electric scooters
and bicycles be extended to December 31, 2024. The original sunset date is set as
May 10, 2024. An extension of the moratorium will allow for greater mobility
throughout the City during Project Downtown construction of Main Street and will also
allow for the possibility of a commercial contract for citywide use of electric scooters
and bicycles. Extending the moratorium - while also approving the Spin contract (next
agenda item) - allows city staff to study this changed dynamic.
All other items of Resolution R-38-23 will remain unchanged.
