PUBLIC COMMENT
Harriet Bouwman wanted to share her family’s (and others they know) perspective on remote learning for
inclement weather days. Harriet said remote learning is difficult due to their family’s internet connection at home.
They have a hot spot but the connection is still poor. Also, often when we have school cancellations due to weather
there are power outages making it difficult for students to virtually attend school.
