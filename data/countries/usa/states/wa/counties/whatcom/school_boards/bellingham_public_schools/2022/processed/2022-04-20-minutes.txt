Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
There has been some interest over the past week regarding plans by a student group to
host a “drag/talent” show after school at Whatcom Middle School. The district received a
few inquiries from within the community, as well as a small number of responses from
people who live outside of our community.
The work required to prepare and present a proposed 2022-23 district budget continues. It
is hoped that a draft budget will be brought to the board in June.

District staff would like to expand Promise K (transitional kindergarten) to a full year for
2022-23. Assistant Superintendent of Teaching and Learning Dr. Kristi Dominguez
talked about how fortunate the Bellingham community is to have high quality childcare.
The state does not fund preschool the same way that it funds K-21, yet the district is
legally required to provide a least restrictive environment to our students. District staff
have been working closely with the Opportunity Council to create a robust, wraparound
program for students who typically have been in developmental preschool, the GRADS
program and programs in the middle. Dr. Dominguez and Trina Hall, executive director
of teaching and learning, have been working on braiding funding from different sources
to make the Promise K expansion possible. Dr. Dominguez responded to questions from
board members.
Dr. Baker shared a slideshow for the 2022 Promise Award recipients, yesterday’s visit
from Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten and highlights from the March 19
BIPOC Job Fair.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Mason loved the Promise Award coverage. She also enjoyed the board visit to
Happy Valley Elementary School last week. It was brave of the students and teachers
to let the board members go into the classroom and be asked about the projects
they’re working on. It was probably the most interactive school visit since students
have been back in person. She received her daughter’s report card recently and was
very impressed with how much robust information it contained about her daughter’s
progress.
• Mr. Benjamin appreciated the Happy Valley school visit and the March 30 student
roundtable at Alderwood. He attended the National School Board Association
(NSBA) conference in San Diego. Most of the sessions he attended focused on mental
health and student voice, which he found inspirational. The highlight was a reception
that was on board the USS Midway. He noted that Kennedy vs. Bremerton School
District, a first amendment case, will be going to the Supreme Court soon. Mr.
Benjamin was recently appointed to WSSDA’s Equity Committee and would be
happy to share more information if requested. He expressed support for the GSA
(Gender Sexuality Alliance) and drag show at Whatcom Middle School and
appreciates how Dr. Baker has handled the situation.

Ms. Rose thanked Executive Director of Technology Kurt Gazow for his technical
assistance with Zoom this evening, as well as to the technology department for help
when her son lost a stylus. She loved the Happy Valley visit and thought the audio
recordings of students were impressive. She has a student at Whatcom Middle School
this year, and one of the things she has heard from her middle schooler is appreciation
for letting the students lead the way, with the district and the superintendent behind
them. She attended a “Yeti book picking” party last night, where her fifth-grade
student was able to help select books to go into the school library for future students.
Ms. Diaz Hackler spoke about an extremely intelligent and social third-grade student
that she met at the Alderwood student roundtable. She also found the kindergarten
students to be amazing at the Happy Valley visit.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• 89% of our students graduated compared to 2010 with only 78.8% of our students graduating.
• The 7-year graduation rate reached 93%.
• 76% of BPS graduates from the class of 2020 are engaged either in employment, higher
education or training programs compared to 50% of those that did not graduate.
• Students involved in CTE had a 90% graduation rate. The difference between low income and
non-low-income students who are in the Asian and Hispanic/Latinx group vary greatly at 98%
above their low income peers.
DB:
• There is evidence that overall graduation rates continue to improve, the impact of the
pandemic notwithstanding. Greater progress has been made with Latinx, free and reduced
lunch and IEP students.
• The data shows evidence of solid growth in students participating in dual credit and CTE
activities over the past few years.
• It is encouraging to see the rate of students with an IEP engage in post-secondary
opportunities, particularly compared to others across the State.
JM:
• Continued decreasing dropout rate for students with IEPs.
• Despite being a small cohort, 100% of Black/African American students graduated from the
class of 2020.

Improvement in 7-year graduation rates for most groups.
Above State average for dual credit enrollment.
4-year college enrollment rate increasing.
Students with IEPs who have graduated have high levels of post-grad engagement.
Demonstrated positive impact of CTE classes.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KB:
• Continued growth in our graduation rates. BPS still has lower graduation rates than Bellevue,
Shoreline and Olympia (comparable districts). Continue to work with our partners to increase
FAFSA/WASFA completion rates.
DB:
• As noted in the report, we still have more to accomplish in compensating for the impacts of
race, language and socio-economic factors on graduation.
JM:
• Continued improvement to close gaps in graduation rates, particularly for students with low
incomes, while also recognizing the significant work that has happened in this area, with
success.
4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Appreciation to all of the work that goes into these Ends reports. The use of graphs and charts
really help to tell the story.
DB:
• The report has a remarkable depth of data, clearly a great deal of work has gone into the
analysis.
• Appreciated seeing the individual student comments, this gives a nuance statistical data
cannot.
JM:
• Appreciate the quotes from graduates who have been part of CTE programs.
• COVID has had such an impact, in ways we don’t completely understand yet; appreciate
pointing out where looks to be a trend vs. acute shift.
5. Possible changes to the policy.
KB:
• None.
DB:
• “All students will succeed and grow regardless of ethnicity, socio-economic status, English
language proficiency or disabilities.” In light of more recent EDI efforts and the broadening
of inclusion, should this language be expanded to include other identified groups such as
LGBTQ+ for example?
• Is there a grammatical problem with 4? Or a missing word?
JM:
• None.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
It has been pointed out in previous EL-3 monitoring reports that the current superintendent’s
performance in this area is not only outstanding but has been a model for other districts to
emulate. This, remarkably, continued with the overwhelming challenges brought on by the
pandemic, made particularly challenging in a continually shifting information environment.
Notable highlights this period:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Covid response
Virtual methods
Parent academy for Spanish speaking families
Continued and expanded EDI efforts
Robust BHS mascot change process
Both print and electronic media continues to expand and improve, notably in professional
quality and gathering of metrics

The board is impressed with the amount of care and thought put into all communications. We are
particularly impressed with the launch of the Parent Academy for Spanish speaking parents.
This was a time when so much critical information needed to be communicated to our
stakeholders with regards to COVID. While there were many perspectives, from both internal and
external voices, Bellingham Public Schools communications remained level, well-informed and
respectful.

Responding to a significant increase in public records requests, which can often be a ton of work!
The family handbook is always such a beautiful and well-developed publication.
The playgrounds flier is a great example of making wonky concepts easy for people to
understand; always appreciate that about the communications from Bellingham Public Schools.
The Community Engagement Team really is one of the gems of this district. This report really
shows the importance of their work. We are a much better district because of this group of people
and what they do for our families.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
No areas for additional improvement.
4. Comments on the report itself.
Once again, the board appreciates all the evidence supplied in the report to show that our
superintendent is in compliance with EL-3. Dr. Baker once pointed out the importance of
investing in Communications – you are either telling the story or playing catch-up and having to
correct misinformation. I have seen firsthand when other organizations have not done this.
Thank you for the “live links”, as well as all the visuals.
It is hoped that more people in our community see pieces of this report; there is so much done
behind the scenes that folks don’t see!
5. Possible changes to the policy.
No changes to the policy.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The ability to pivot to remote hiring and creating new efficiencies during the pandemic is
remarkable.
Remarkable job demonstrating comprehensive staff development across all levels of staff,
particularly during the strain and demand of the pandemic.
The board supports all the work the superintendent has done for staff development. In particular,
the body of work to support staff and student well-being is very impressive.
The virtual employee recognition and awards were a great way to continue highlighting our
staff’s work during this time. The Promise Awards video was a particularly fun watch.
Appreciate the diversity represented in the #humansofBPS campaign. They’re always very
interesting and represent the dedication of our staff.
Creando Connections was such an innovative and inspiring volunteer project. Appreciate the
intensity of EDI work that happens at all levels and across positions.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
On the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) test data, Bellingham Public Schools (BPS)
students outperformed the state at every grade level except grade 11 math. We find it interesting
that only Connecticut outperformed BPS and that they spend $7,000.00 more per student.
This has certainly been unprecedented. Despite this, the board can see by this report that the
superintendent and his team have thought about what can be done to overcome any obstacles. We
appreciate all of the extra hard work and look forward to more improvements in the next couple
of years.
While the goal is no achievement gaps at all, that the gaps did not grow is a testament to the
district’s work in working connect with and serve all families during the pandemic.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
The report identifies gaps that need continued efforts, such as students with an IEP.
4. Comments on the report itself.
The report was really well done.
