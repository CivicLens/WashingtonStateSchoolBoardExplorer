  3. WORK SESSION TOPICS
A. TOPIC 1 - K-12 Counselor Report
Caitlin Patterson & Sasha Squires presented an overview of the district's K-12 counseling program and the services being offered to students. This past year Caitlin has worked Monday-Thursday on campus and from home on Fridays.  Ms. Patterson sees approximately 6-7 students per day but is also available in crisis situations. On Fridays she has zoom meetings with missed kids, parent calls, planning, notes and researching topics to meet the specific needs of students. She is also available for crisis situations. Sasha is on campus Monday through Thursday with on campus hours for school counseling and private practice work with our students and families. Ms. Squires is on call Fridays for crisis situations. At this time she has a caseload of 18 students. The district has a comprehensive team that includes a student assistant professional who provides substance abuse prevention and intervention services (Kristi Korslund); an Academic Advisor who works with secondary scheduling, graduation requirements, advising students for post high school plans and providing guidance for navigating the post-secondary world (Sarah Reser); GEAR UP which is a program to increase academic performance and preparation for post-secondary education (Heather Clarys); And a school psychologist for analyzing complex student and school problems and selecting and implementing appropriate evidence based interventions to improve outcomes at home and school (Katelyn Wambold). Caitlin and Sasha would like to see a full-time and part-time counselor model for the 2024-2025 school year in order to implement the curriculum and programs they have been working on this year. In addition they want to make sure our students are supported by implementing a Tier 1 curriculum. It is imperative we have the counseling staff to meet the needs of students individually and in crisis which takes at least 1.5 school counselors. Superintendent Stewart recommended approving the framework now and then in the future the curriculum would be reviewed and adopted so there is time for a full curriculum review. This framework aligns with the Character Strong program we are already doing in the district and the classrooms. Director Dieu would like to postpone the approval of the framework until the next meeting so the board can fully review the handout presented during the meeting. Director Dieu would also like to see more people in the district students can identify with in the event there are issues on the playground, hallways or cafeteria so students can seek immediate help by a trusted individual. Discussion was held to try to problem solve how to best serve our students with the different models presented tonight which could include the school nurse or the prevention intervention counselor.
    B. TOPIC 2 - Policy Governance Rick Maloney
Rich Maloney is a consultant in Policy Governance and Coherent Governance and has worked with school districts for over 20 years beginning a few years after his district adopted the policy governance model in 2003. As a board member for 25 years at University Place School District Rick was elected 10 times to serve as the president of his school board. Mr. Maloney gave an overview of the difference between governance and management and the board's responsibilities vs. that of the superintendent and school administration. Mr. Maloney pointed out the main points of policy governance as 1. The Board Serves Owners 2. The Board Governs via Policy 3. The Board Assigns Responsibility; 4. The Board Delegates Authority; 5. The Board Delivers Accountability.
Mr. Maloney used Dayton's Strategic Plan and Dayton's Board Operating Principles to demonstrate how policy governance can be used. Mr. Maloney referred to policy governance as a juggler keeping 3 glass balls in the air at one time; Control Means, define ends and Monitor Progress. The Board’s Governance Responsibilities Board Readiness: Establishing a productive mindset and a disciplined, strategic approach to its work, then periodically reorienting itself and renewing its focus and energy, the board ensures its governing capacity is primed for maximum effectiveness. This ‘first responsibility’ of the board is the appropriate object of periodic board retreats. The other three responsibilities are appropriate subjects to be discussed in a retreat, but renewing board readiness is the object. Discussion was held on the topic and some of the benefits of the program. Incoming Superintendent Wheatley believes this would be a good process and is looking forward to moving forward.
  4. ACTION ITEMS
