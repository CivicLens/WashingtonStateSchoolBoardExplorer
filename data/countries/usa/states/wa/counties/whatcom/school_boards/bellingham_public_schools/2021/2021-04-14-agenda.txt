The purpose of the emergency waiver program is to provide an equitable mechanism that prevents
students from being unduly impacted by unforeseen disruptions to coursework and assessments
resulting from an emergency as defined in RCW.38.52.010, or as declared by an authorized federal
official. The State Board of Education has adopted emergency rules that respond to the gubernatorial
declaration of emergency of February 29, 2020, and apply to the classes of 2020 and 2021 in the 20202021 school year. The emergency rules allow the district to seek waivers for both subject area credits
and pathway graduation requirements for eligible students, on an individual student basis after the district
completes all emergency waiver program requirements.
