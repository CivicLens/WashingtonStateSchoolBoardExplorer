The Blaine School District held a special board meeting on January 13, 2020, to discuss and approve the first reading of several new policies. Policy 3211, "Gender-Inclusive Schools," was introduced in response to Senate Bill 5689 which required the district to adopt such a policy by January 31, 2020. During discussion, two sentences regarding communication with parents were slated for removal from the updated procedural language. Concerns about locker room privacy and how similar gender issues are handled in lower grades were also raised. The board unanimously approved the first reading of Policy 3211.  Policies 3143 "District Notification of Juvenile Offenders," 3144 "Release of Information Concerning Student Sexual and Kidnapping Offenders" and 3145 "Sex Offender Access to District Property" were also introduced for their first reading. These policies, developed in collaboration with law enforcement, aim to establish a common protocol for addressing sexual offenders' access to school property. Discussions centered around the public availability of related information and the limited access granted to adult offenders who have children attending Blaine Schools. The board unanimously approved the first reading of all three policies.
