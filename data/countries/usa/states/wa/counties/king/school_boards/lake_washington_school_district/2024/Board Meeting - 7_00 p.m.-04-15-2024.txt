9. Continued approval for WANIC Long-Range Plan Resolution No. 2367

Meeting :

Apr 15, 2024 - Board Meeting - 7:00 p.m.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Public Content

Adopt Resolution No. 2367 approving the Skills Center LongRange Plan, certifying that expected and/or actual uses of
process will be identified in advance and/or reported with
claims for reimbursement to OSPI, and authorizing the
designated district employees to sign all necessary
documents relating to the Skills Center Capital Grant
Projects.

Situation:
Skills Centers in the State of Washington receive capital improvement funding through the State
Legislature. In 2022, WANIC submitted for Capital Improvement funds. It is known that it takes an
estimated 10-15 years for Skills Centers to receive requested funding. Every two years, Skills Centers
must resubmit the request to maintain placement in the order of submission.
Resolution No. 2367 approves the Long-Range capital plan for WANIC. This approval serves as an
outlook to future opportunities and does not guarantee any one project or program. When funding is
allocated to WANIC for capital improvements, those dollars would be spent in alignment with the longrange plan and in collaboration with the WANIC Consortium goals at that time.

Matching Funds Resolution No. 2365

Apr 15, 2024 - Board Meeting - 7:00 p.m.

Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

Adopt Resolution No. 2365 redirecting 2022
Construction Levy proceeds and matching funds as
presented.

Public Content
SITUATION:
In October of 2021, the board passed Resolution No. 2321 authorizing a special election on February 8, 2022 in order to propose
a $295 million six-year capital construction levy. The levy proceeds were to be used to complete the first phase of projects in the
districts Building Excellence Plan. The projects included additions to three middle schools; new elementary capacity on the
Redmond elementary campus, new high school capacity in the Lake Washington/ Redmond/Eastlake areas, acquiring property,
and other capital projects. The six- year levy election passed, and the district is currently collecting the proceeds in calendar
years 2023 through 2028.

In April of 2023, the board passed Resolution No. 2345 authorizing the repurposing of 2022 levy funds from Redmond
Elementary campus to rebuild/enlarge Rockwell Elementary and the 2019 and 2022 capital construction levy proceeds and
SCAP funds to be redirected so that they also may be used for capital construction projects to serve the districts aging facilities
and capacity needs. These include rebuild and enlarge projects for aging schools; facility additions; and other capacity projects
including portables, upgrades to classrooms, future bond and levy planning, internal building modifications and property
acquisition.
In October 2023, the board passed Resolution No. 2361 authorizing repurposed of 2022 levy funds to add a gymnasium facility
to the 600-student capacity High School Project in Sammamish (Site 59).
In late Fall district staff and City of Sammamish staff discussed evolving permitting requirements which would impact the
schedule resulting in a delay of construction by one year. Unanticipated right-of-way improvements were required resulting in
additional $14-$15 million in costs. In addition, the 5-month focus group work and community engagement provided no preferred
options for educational programing to meet desired capacity relief for recommendations that would relieve capacity at both
Redmond and Eastlake High School.
Therefore, the recommendation is to hold on Site 59 development and repurpose levy funds to provide classroom and core
space additions at Eastlake and Redmond High Schools. District staff shared information regarding the recommendation at the
February 5 and March 16 study sessions; and provided a presentation at the March 25 board meeting.
The rationale for the recommendation is as follows:
Addresses individual capacity needs at both Eastlake and Redmond High School by providing each school with up to 300student permanent capacity additions to serve the current and projected student population at Eastlake and Redmond
High Schools
Provides funds for core space additions where feasible (overall capacity may be decreased due to core space
modifications)
Reduces the reliance on portables
Addresses capacity at the same or lower cost as the original Site 59 construction budget
Invests levy funds in permanent infrastructure that can be used in the short and long-terms.
Completes projects by Fall 2026 in the same timeline as the revised Site 59 construction plan
While prior resolutions allowed funds to be used on any capital project, given the elimination of one project and replacing it with
another, this is being brought for board action. Resolution 2365, redirecting construction levy funds, is attached.
The resolution authorizes the 2022 capital construction levy proceeds and SCAP funds to be redirected so that they can be used
for up to a 12-classroom addition and core space modifications at Eastlake High School (Site 86) and Redmond High School
(Site 85).
The resolution also directs the superintendent to do the following:
Prepare a study on the feasibility, engagement/community considerations, financing, and implementation plan for the
evaluation of a 5th Comprehensive High School by March 2025
Prepare a study on the alternatives to addressing high school enrollment such as (1) do nothing, (2) additional choice
school options and (3) district wide reboundary using current facilities by March 2025.
Previous resolutions continue to allow use for any capital construction projects to serve the districts aging facilities and capacity
needs. These include rebuild and enlarge projects for aging schools; facility additions; and other capacity projects including
portables, upgrades to classrooms, future bond and levy planning, internal building modifications and property acquisition.
RECOMMENDATION
The Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. 2365 redirecting 2022 Construction Levy proceeds and matching funds as
presented.

Public Hearing on LGO Bonds

Meeting :

Apr 15, 2024 - Board Meeting - 7:00 p.m.

Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

Adopt Resolution No.2366 authorizing the issuance and
sale of Limited General Obligation Bonds of the district in
the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed
$50,000,000 as presented.

Public Content
SITUATION:
Resolution No. 2366 authorizes the sale of up to $50,000,000 of Limited General Obligation (LGO) Bonds. In February 2022, the
voters approved a six-year $295,000,000 construction levy for the purpose of funding critical construction needs across the
district. Projects currently include classroom additions at Finn Hill, Kirkland and Redmond Middle Schools; rebuilding and
enlarging Rockwell Elementary; high school capacity on both the west and east side of the district; and property. The middle
school addition projects are being built over three-year time frame, while the levy proceeds will come in over a six-year time
frame. Therefore it is necessary to sell non-voted bonds to fund the short term cash needs of the district and use the levy
proceeds to pay back the bonds during the six-year window.
RCW 28A.520.080 requires the board to hold a public hearing on the LGO bond proposal. The 2022 six-year construction levy is
expected to be used to pay the principal of the bonds, and state school construction assistance program (SCAP) capital funds
will be used to pay interest on the bonds.
The resolution delegates to the Superintendent or Associate Superintendent, Business and Support Services the authority to
direct the bond underwriter to market the bonds within certain parameters set forth in the resolution. Parameters include bond
amount, final maturity by December 1, 2028, and an aggregate true interest costs not to exceed 5.0% This advance
authorization also provides flexibility in timing the bond sale as the sale can be schedule based on market conditions through
December 31, 2024 as long as the interest rate parameters in the resolution are met.
After review of this action and resolution, the districts bond counsel finds them to be in legal compliance. The terms of this
transaction will be reviewed by the districts independent financial advisor, Northwest Municipal Advisors, prior to the sale being
commenced to ensure the best interest of the district is represented.
RECOMMENDATION:

The Board of Directors adopts Resolution No.2366 authorizing the issuance and sale of Limited General Obligation Bonds of the
district in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $50,000,000 as presented.

OPERATIONAL EXPECTATIONS POLICY, OE-3, TREATMENT OF COMMUNITY
STAKEHOLDERS
April 15, 2024
The Boards Governance Policies call for the monitoring of each policy based on the annual
calendar in GC-6, Annual Work Plan. A revision to Operational Expectations Policy, OE-3,
Treatment of Community Stakeholders, is now being presented for a first reading.
Situation
The Lake Washington School Board met on December 4, 2023, during a study session and
again on January 22, 2024, during a study session to review operational expectation polices OE3, Treatment of Community Stakeholders, and OE-9, Communication and Engagement with the
Community. The Board considered the benefit of having these two policies consolidated and
discussed its values related to community engagement and experience. The Board was
presented with frameworks related to best practices for community engagement and examples
of how different public agencies across the country have incorporated those frameworks into
policy.

Recommendation
The Board of Directors will take formal action at the May 6, 2024, meeting to adopt the attached
policy as the new OE-3, now entitled Community Engagement and Experience. Furthermore, the
Board will take formal action to retire OE-9 as OE-3 and OE-9 have now been consolidated into
the updated OE-3 policy.
