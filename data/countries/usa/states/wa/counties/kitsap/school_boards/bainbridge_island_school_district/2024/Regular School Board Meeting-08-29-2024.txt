d. Four-Year Forecast
Commentary:
Revenues:
Revenues for 2024-2025 are budgeted at $67,745,411.
This is an increase of 9.6% compared to actual revenue in 2022-2023, and an increase of 7.4% compared to the
previous years budget.
The revenue budget includes $2,000,000 in budget capacity.
The full levy amount has been budgeted to avoid the need for an additional resolution in the fall for rollback
amounts.
The final revenue budget reflects slight increases in CTE enrollment and kindergarten enrollment from the draft
budget.

Expenditures:
2024-2025 Expenditures are budgeted at $69,891,137. This is a 10.3% increase over 22-23 actuals and a 7.9% increase
compared to the previous years budget.
Utilities were budgeted at a 5% increase. Insurance premiums increased by 15%.
The rise in expenditures continues to outpace the rise in revenues, leading to another projected deficit.
The budget for regular instruction shows a 7.5% increase from 23-24 indicating a consistent focus on maintaining
or enhancing instructional programs.
The budget for Special Education shows a budgeted increase of about 6.1% over the 2023-2024 budget,
reflecting a sustained emphasis on special education services.
Support Services show a decrease of 3.3% from the 2023-2024 budget due to shifting priorities and cost-saving
measures.
Fund Balance:
As of August 31, 2025, the ending fund balance in the General Fund is projected to be 3% of the 24-25 expenditures. The gap to
the Board policy mandated 5% reserve is approximately 1.3 million dollars. This is indicative of increasing financial strain in light
of legislative changes and inaction.
While the district is focusing on maintaining and improving instructional services, there are significant financial challenges ahead,
particularly with the shrinking fund balance and ongoing deficits. Careful financial management will be necessary to ensure longterm sustainability. The goal is to begin a 1-3 year plan for right-sizing the budget while continuing to support the outstanding
instructional work being done in BISD.

Re: Safety Net Submission and Funding
_________________________________________

On August 29, 2024, I will be presenting to the school board on the Safety Net program. Safety Net is a state and federal
reimbursement funding source designed to support districts that incur special education costs exceeding the amounts covered
by standard state and federal funding. This August, our district received $1,760,904 in Safety Net funding. Each year, Bainbridge
Island spends significantly more than the allocated funds to ensure we provide a free and appropriate public education to our
students. This presentation will offer an overview of the Safety Net program, explain how we calculate these funds, and compare
our current funding with the last four years of allocations.

Re: Monthly Report on Technology Levy, Planning and Projects

Technology Levy Budget Summary
This is a summary of the 2023/2024 technology levy budget. This summary provides information on the total encumbrances
(outstanding and paid) applied to the 2023/2024 fiscal school year. The 2023/2024 technology levy budget is supported by
collections from 2021 BISD technology levies.
SY 2023/2024Technology Levy Budget Capacity
Encumbered To Date (Commitment to Pay when Invoiced)
Variance (Est. Remaining Encumbered Budget Capacity)

$ 2,866,770.00
$ 2,763,855.87
$ 102,914.13

$ 2,866,770.00
$ 2,720,717.64
$ 146,052.36

Im pleased to report that our final expenditures for the Tech Levy are within our anticipated range. The total remaining
encumbered capacity shown above is $102,914.13, however this number does not include our final August payroll for Tech
related staff. With our August Tech payroll factored in, we estimate the 2023-2024 Tech Levy total expenditure to be
approximately $2,909,770, which is $43,000 over the original budget capacity of $2,866,770. The reason for this over
expenditure is due to $500,000 in unplanned payroll expenses incurred this year, as documented in several of my earlier monthly
reports.
Currently, all Technology staff are very busy preparing for the start of school. Im also pleased to report that Phase 1 of the
Network Switch replacement project is complete and that the District has been approved by the FCC for a reimbursement of
approximately $204,000 once Phase 2 is complete and all documentation submitted.
