7. Reports
a. Superintendent
b. Teaching and Learning
Assistant Superintendent of Teaching & Learning, Julie van Wijk, gave an introduction to
the board about the purpose of School Improvement Plans.
Ellie Meenk, Lea Kope, and Vanessa Gunderson presented Lynden Academy’s School
Improvement Plan (SIP). Their goals were aligned with the district-wide focus on
exceptional learning experiences for students through work with the UDL. At the building
level, they have chosen to focus this year on math. They presented specific data goals
related to improvement in student math scores. They shared information on their WIN
(What I Need) intervention program and the strategies being used to provide extra
support for students who need it. They also shared student math test scores from the
district-wide Renaissance testing.
Mandy Jessee, Holly Priestman, and Amy Miller presented Fisher Elementary School’s
School Improvement Plan (SIP). They also are working on goals aligned with the district
regarding the UDL framework in correlation with professional development, language
acquisition of multilingual learners, and they shared data used to inform this goal. Their
building level focus area is aligned with the district’s strategic priority of exceptional
learning experiences for all students. Through multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS),
they have set goals in both English language arts and math. They shared how they are
working to achieve those goals through interventions.
Rex Fraser, Tawnee Parcher, and Melissa VanDalen presented Bernice Vossbeck
Elementary’s School Improvement Plan (SIP). Their building focus area is related to
professional collaboration to provide exceptional learning experiences for all students.
They also shared goals related to MTSS, high growth quadrants, and their use of SGP
(student growth percentile) data to track progress towards math and reading goals.
They also spoke about CBM (curriculum-based measurements) through STAR testing.
They shared information about their work with ML students in WIN interventions. There
has been an improvement felt by instructors this year with access to student data and
using it to provide students with exactly what they need. Paras have been much more
involved this year with training and PLC time to develop their intervention skills. The
Vossbeck team is meeting the academic needs of students through WIN groups, data
days, PLC- collaborative teams, and new learning for staff. They also presented
information on how they meet the behavior and social emotional needs of their students
through Safe & Civil Schools.

Assistant Superintendent of Teaching & Learning, Dr. Julie van Wijk then presented
information on the district’s curriculum adoption process and maintenance plan. She
gave information on the recently adopted elementary CKLA curriculum for literacy.
Lynden High School science curriculum will be the next curriculum addressed. They are
currently piloting new curriculum with implementation planned for next year. Math
curriculum is also being discussed and will need to be addressed in the next few years.
Every curriculum that we consider is in alignment with the Washington State learning
standards.
Dr. van Wijk then shared the LHS science adoption timeline which includes a 30-day
community review, consensus by the science team, approval of the curriculum by the
Instructional Materials Committee (IMC), and approval by the school board.
Director Owsley expressed an interest in reviewing the science curriculum in more depth
than what would be provided to the board during a regular board meeting.
Director Hickman asked about how much feedback from the community is taken into
consideration following the 30-day community review. It was explained that the
feedback would be communicated to the IMC and taken into consideration during
