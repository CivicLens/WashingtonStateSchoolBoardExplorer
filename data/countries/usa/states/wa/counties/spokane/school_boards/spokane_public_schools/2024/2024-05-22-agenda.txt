Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation:
Approval of purchase order to Lenovo United States, Inc., Morrisville, NC for the purchase of JAR charging carts in the amount
of $365,928.
Background:
JAR Elevate charging carts support the districts middle school classroom device model. These carts will support student learning
by integrating technology into the curriculum. As students progress, they will develop digital literacy skills and take personal
responsibility for their devices. By 8th grade, students will confidently use devices for schoolwork and demonstrate independent
care. These carts will save money by reducing the number of devices that are damaged when used off-site by students. Multiple
carts were tested and the JAR carts were deemed to be the most durable, repairable and provide the best level of support.
This will be a general fund expenditure. Pricing is considered fair and reasonable and accesses Omnia Partners cooperative
contract no. 01-146.
