    5. REPORTS BY ADMINISTARTORS
Brenda Padgett, Superintendent reported on 
Initial OSPI diagnostic assessments indicate students are generally meeting expected benchmarks. Further analysis will guide targeted interventions where needed.
The school year has launched smoothly. Traffic around the school is manageable, thanks to close coordination between building administrators, SSO, and transportation teams. Ongoing discussions will continue to enhance safety and flow.
As anticipated, the Sped co-op has experienced challenges, but significant progress is being made. Kerri is putting in exceptional effort, and although frustrations remain—especially with old narratives circulating—there is visible progress following a productive 4-hour Sped meeting.
SEL is a focus area in elementary (K-5). Heather Jacoby is teaching students essential tools to help them self-regulate and modify behavior, using strategies from the "What Would Kelso Do?" program. Early results are promising.
Fred Wetzel, SSO, has been vital in backing up administrative efforts, especially during searches. He is also adding value by ensuring every new staff member is briefed on safety procedures. Fred will continue emphasizing that security is here to keep the students safe, not to police them.
  6. Student Representative Report
The school year is off to a strong start with 95 freshmen joining Onalaska High School
We’ve welcomed new staff members who are contributing positively to the school environment.
Multiple assemblies have been held to encourage a positive attitude and school spirit across the student body.
On October 2, we’ll have a Club Fair, similar to job fairs, to introduce students to the various clubs and activities available. This is an effort to get more students involved.
Volleyball: The team has won 3 of their last 5 games.
Soccer: The soccer team has secured 2 wins.
Football: The football team has won 2 games. Excitement is building for the Homecoming game against Toledo.
Cross Country: The season has started with strong participation and competition.
Tailgate Fridays have been introduced as a reward system for students who avoid using their phones in class and demonstrate good behavior. This incentive has been well received by the student body.
I’ve noticed Fred 5-0 interacting positively with the students, building relationships and contributing to a safer and friendlier school atmosphere.
  The high school band had an exciting experience attending Husky Band Day at the University of Washington, which was a great opportunity for our students to engage with a college-level band.
7. FINANCIAL REPORTS
Discussion, Reports: 7.1 Financial Report - Kathleen Ahmann, Business Manager
As of the end of August, the district has a positive general fund balance of $927,993.72. However, this figure is still subject to change as we are in the process of closing out the 2023-2024 school year. Some grants still need to be claimed, and others are pending funding.
The district’s enrollment for the beginning of the year exceeded expectations. While we conservatively budgeted for an 805 FTE, the September count came in higher at 829.56 FTE, which will positively impact financial planning moving forward.
