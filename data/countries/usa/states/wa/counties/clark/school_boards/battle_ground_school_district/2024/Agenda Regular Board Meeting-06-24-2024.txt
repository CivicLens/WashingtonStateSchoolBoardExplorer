The Board of Directors approve paid meal prices for
the 2024-25 school year.

Public Content
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) requires all school districts to calculate their weighted average paid lunch price using
the Paid Lunch Equity (PLE) Tool. This tool ensures that paid lunches are not subsidized by federal funds provided under the NSLP
(National School Lunch Program).
The 2024-24 PLE tool calculation recommends increasing paid lunch prices by $0.85; however, the USDA requires the district to increase
meal prices by $0.10.

Paid meal prices only apply to students who do not qualify for free or reduced meals and for schools who do not meet other qualifications for
free meals to all students under a state or federal program.
Alternative Learning Experience programs (River HomeLink, CAM, Summit View HS) follow middle school pricing.
Chief Financial Officer Michelle Scott will be available to answer questions from the Board if they arise.

Cindy Arnold, Director of CTE
Background:

No previous textbook has been used as curriculum for this course. The course has been aligned with the
Clark College dual credit program, and an assortment of supplemental curricular materials have been
used. These materials have allowed students to become certified with the STARS (State Training and
Registry System) program of early childhood education. With the development of Transitional
Kindergarten in BGPS, a more comprehensive, textbook based, curriculum is needed. Students will
continue to become STARS-certified upon completion of this course.

This proposal comes with the endorsement from the Instructional Materials Committee (IMC) that the
adoption process for this proposal has met all requirements of Board Policy 2020 and Procedure 2020P
for CTE curricula.

Presenter:

Background:

While the changes to Policy 3241 are non-substantive, many additions provide the reader an
understanding of the legislative "why" behind House Bill 1207 and give greater clarity around engaging
staff in best practices to support students in modifying their behavior in a positive way. The most
significant change in the bill was to remove the term "emergency expulsion" and replace it with
"emergency removal," a statutory mandate. The policy also outlines best practices in monitoring
discipline data for subgroups of students while providing annual training and monitoring consistent
implementation across a school building.

Based on SB 5257 there is a need to separate policy 6700 Nutrition, Health and Physical Fitness into three policies. 6700 Nutrition, 6701
Recess and Physical Activity, and 6702 Wellness. There are no substantivechanges to the content of 6700 Nutrition, Health and Physical
Fitness other than removing those sections that will be moved to other policies. The changes are largely to policy 6701 Recess and Physical
Activity to include the requirement of 30 minutes of daily recess at the elementary level. Policy 6702 will be titled Wellness and include
former sections of Policy 6700.
