is being held on the ancestral homelands of the Coast Salish people.
Roll Call:
Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw (President), Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler,
Jenn Mason, Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
No public testimony was offered.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• It’s been a busy few weeks with students now back in school. Enrollment is still being
determined, with student numbers looking higher at the elementary level and lower at
the Bellingham Family Partnership Program than was initially projected.
• We are currently in a good place budget-wise, but similar to other school districts
across the nation, we are wondering how significantly we will be impacted by the loss
of federal COVID-19 funding. We hope that the state legislature will recognize how
the loss of the federal funding will affect local school districts.
• Over 2,000 people attended the second annual Back-to-School Block Party at
Bellingham High School on Aug. 20, with many agencies providing services to
students and families. Principals, deans and staff from each school were in
attendance.
• The all-staff event at Civic Field on Aug. 29 was well attended, with district buses
transporting staff from across the district. Student performances were a highlight of
the morning.
• It has been an exciting start to the school year and a dramatic shift from the last
couple of years of COVID restrictions, from masks to remote learning. The 2022-23
school year is off to a great start with Promise K as a full year program for the first
time. It’s offered currently in 13 of our 14 elementary schools. It is an inclusive
kindergarten setting with all preschool students being together.
• Construction is underway at the new district office site. It will be one of the first
buildings in the area to be built using cross laminated timber, which is a more
sustainable product than steel. A project web camera is installed at the site and
construction progress can be monitored on the district website.

The main portion of the new Sunnyland Elementary building is nearly complete. The
playground should open in approximately a week, with the first elementary turf field
opening in October. A Community Open House is scheduled from 4 to 5:30 p.m. on
Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022. The community will be able to tour the inside of the school,
see the newly installed inclusive playground and enjoy a free snack from a local food
truck, courtesy of Dawson Construction.
The district is offering a new construction management class at Squalicum High
School, and there are 50 students from our high schools enrolled in our cosmetology
program at the Bellis Fair Mall.
Dr. Baker responded to questions from board members.

School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Mr. Benjamin thought the August school board retreat was great. He noted that the
application for the WSSDA Board of Distinction award has been submitted, and he
thanked Executive Director of Communications and Community Relations Jackie
Brawley and Deputy Superintendent Mike Copland for their work in preparing the
application. The district’s all staff event was wonderful! WSSDA representatives met
with the Executive Director of the National School Boards Association (NSBA) on
Sept. 1, and they learned that approximately 25 states have withdrawn from the
NSBA. He does not anticipate that Washington State will withdraw. He reminded
board members that WSSDA is tracking the required equity training series
completion by individual board members. On Sept. 6 he spoke to the Bellingham Bay
Rotary Club, a great group that among its community efforts has raised $.5 million
for new docks at Bloedel Donovan Park. Today Mr. Benjamin filed his intent to run
for District Area 1 Director. He congratulated the district on the astounding Promise
K numbers, noting that it is powerful work.
• Ms. Mason agreed that the all-staff event was lovely and knows how much work it
took for it to appear effortless. She appreciated Dr. Baker speaking to the work and
the mission of the district. The school board retreat was great and seeing the new
Sunnyland was awesome. What an incredible community we have that passes bonds
to build great new schools. As a parent, it has felt like a normal school year, and she
is excited about the inclusive experience her daughter is experiencing.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler thanked everyone for the behind-the-scenes work at the all-staff
event. She is impressed with the new Sunnyland Elementary, particularly the brick
patio, the mural and pieces of the old school as a part of the new building.
• Ms. Rose loves seeing the data points on the partnerships the district has within the
community. She thinks the new Parent Square app is amazing from a parent’s
standpoint. The new Sunnyland Elementary has made the neighborhood better and
she believes that new schools are conducive to student learning. She noted that it is a
testimony to the culture of a school when her two middle school sons were
disappointed to have missed a day of school due to having a cold.
• Ms. Bashaw found the Back-to-School Block Party impressive and inclusive. Having
principals and teachers there means a lot to families. The all-staff event was
impressive. She was contacted by the parent of a 3-year-old child with a speech delay
who was pleasantly surprised after filling out an online inquiry form last evening to
have heard back from the district before noon today.
