A. Public Comment
Director Simpson called for Public Comments.
Joe Camacho, Teacher - FHS - Foster High School is proud to receive the King County Re+ School Voucher to support our transition to

compostable utensils. By making this switch, we estimate a reduction of 233,280 plastic utensils annually, contributing to waste
reduction and environmental stewardship. Our total supply request was for approximately $7,700, based on pricing from the Cedar
Grove-approved vendor used by other local districts. This opportunity was made possible through our partnership with Sam Wilder at
the city of Tukwila who has also supported our student led composting program at FHS and other compositing initiatives at the
elementary schools. The compostable utensils were delivered last week on 10/17 and are being used in the lunchroom as of 10/21. By
switching to compostable utensils we have reduced the amount of plastic in our lunchroom that students have to sort- almost everything
in the lunchroom is compostable now. Students are only separating the milk cartons, which are recyclable, and the plastic wrap and
plastic clamshells/cups used for salads, fruit, and parfaits. Earlier this year the FHS garden program received funding from the Port of
Seattle through the South King County Community Impact Fund for a total of $60,000 - $20,000 each year over the next 3 years.- this
grant will fund the first few phases of the garden expansion including the outdoor classroom, additional growing spaces, perimeter
fencing, and much more. Tilth Alliance, a local non-profit, agreed to serve as a fiscal sponsor for the grant and has been assisting with
the planning and implementation of the project. Unfortunately, the project is currently at a standstill as the approval of the next phase of
the garden expansion is being passed from director to director at the district level. While we have been awarded the grant, if we do not
utilize the funds each year we will lose access to the remaining funds. I’m looking forward to working with district leadership and our
partners at Tilth Alliance to create a garden where our students can learn and grow.
Robin Allsopp - Secretary - Tukwila Elementary - Congratulated Aiden Hallock as the new Jr. Student Representative to the
Board of Directors.

protocols to ensure our students' safety.

Director Kruller is bringing this back to the district to see what ways can we get students excited bout the Historica Society.

Weather Damage Mitigation
Director Larson inquired on the air quality at Cascade View, in particular, the internal air quality. We know that the school is
located near the Sea-Tac Airport. He shared that, to his knowledge, we've never done any studies about indoor air quality at
Cascade View, or the number of students who have asthma, etc. He shared that there have been discussions regarding Cascade
View being updated/replaced, but that will be in approximately seven (7) years if a bond is approved. Is there a way to improve
the ventilation at a reasonable amount of cost? Director Cardenas shared that sensors need to be installed around the school to
ensure that we are getting correct readings on indoor air quality.
Director Larson inquired about lead in the water. at Foster High School. Director Cardenas shared that they received information
from the Department of Health. They are starting to test in school districts, however, they will start with school districts that
they have not had in testing first. We are currently on their list for testing, but we are near the end of the list for testing. She
shared that she has researched TSD testing on our own, but there are costs related to doing that. Director Larson suggested
that we conduct strategic testing in buildings that we think might have higher lead levels. He shared that testing at FHS was
postponed because of the remodel. Director Cardenas shared that 80% of the plumbing was replaced during the remodel,
fountains were replaced, etc. The two (2) fountains in the gym and the one (1) fountain in the music hall were not replaced.
Director Larson commented that those three fountains should be tested.
CFO Fleming shared that testing costs would come out of the General Fund budget which is really "tight" right now. Director
Simpson asked if the testing could be conducted by TSD. Director Cardenas shared that we have to use an outside company
and/or contractor to test for lead as all the reports must be certified. Director Cardenas shared that the cost could be over
$20,000. She shared that she has already contacted PBS Environmental to discuss lead testing. The $20,000 estimate from PBS
Environmental included testing at all schools, for all drinkable water. This would not include water from the bathroom sinks.
Director Larson commented that signs should be placed in the bathrooms and other areas that direct students to use the drinking
fountains.
Director Kruller made a motion to get a scaled-down estimate to test lead in water in specific student areas that the students are
using for their drinking areas, including samples in some areas where pipes were not replaced, as well as in areas where pipes
were replaced and will include the drinking fountains in the gym and the music room.
Director Larson seconded the motion.
All voted in favor of the motion.
The motion carried.
E. Technology Plan
Director Larson commented on the robotics program. We have robotic programs at the elementary level, and we need to figure
out a way to get this program back into the middle school. We need to find a way to have access to both sports and STEM
programs. Director Larson shared that he would like to see some specific items in the plan to address getting the robotics
program back in the middle school. Executive Director Draganov shared that the district is not opposed to supporting a robotics
program. We have offered a stipend for any educators who are interested in leading the robotics program before or after school.
One task through the tech team is putting out information throughout the weekly bulletin which will start getting people excited
about it. We have had strong participation in one of the elementary schools in the past. We do have everything needed,
including compensation, to get this program running again.
Additional discussion on:
Cyber security
Tracking of items on hold due to budgetary concerns
Creative Learning Labs
Professional Development
AI Protocols - Presentation by Theren Hayes requested.
F. School Safety Plan
Director Larson commented on the plan's statement that "Schools should discourage students from using cell phones." He
shared that cell phones could be very helpful. Chief Whitbeck agreed and shared that cell phones would be helpful depending on
the situation, i.e., lockdown versus lockout versus shelter in place and what is the difference. We could add definitions of each
situation.
Director Larson shared that this document needs to be simplified for parents and families.
Director Simpson asked if the SRO is included in the plans? Chief Whitbeck shared that the SRO is included in the safety plans.

Director Kruller shared that the plans are not very well organized. She shared that there is a national program called CERT which
stands for Community/Citizens Emergency Response Teams. She shared that the City of Tukwila collaborated with the police and
fire department on their safety plan. She asked if we have been in contact with those departments on the district's safety plans.
Chief Whitbeck shared that once we get feedback from the Board, schools, staff, etc. then we will work with the police and fire
department.

B. Approval of School Improvement Plans
Director Larson made a motion to approve the School Improvement Plans.

Director Larson shared that this is a draft, and he will not approve a draft. There should be a discussion on the SIPs. He shared
that it would be nice to have the SIP plans come to Board in a more adjustable format and include the goals, which are
distributed throughout. Additionally, include information on last year's goals, i.e. what were they, were they achieved or not,
why or why not, etc. Then move to next year's goals. Superintendent Pedroza shared that school administrators looked at last
year's data when revising those plans. They spent time in school leader's meetings looking at and discussing all data and
revisions. The state requires the template that is used for the plans. A new template will require additional time. Additionally,
the state requires that SIP's are approved by January 31st. Chief Whitbeck shared that the OSPI Coach attended all of the
meetings regarding the SIPs and data. All of the notes and minutes from those meetings would lye with them. Director Larson
commented that he does not want a new template, he wants the goals listed. Chief Whitbeck shared that the plans presented
today have been approved by the OSPI coach.

board meeting.
