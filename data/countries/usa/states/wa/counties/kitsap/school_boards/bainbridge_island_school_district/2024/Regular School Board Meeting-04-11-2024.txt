Re: Middle School Sports Coaches

_______________________________________________________________
Intro:
The Bainbridge Island school district currently doesnt offer Football, Wrestling, Baseball, Softball, and Girls Soccer at the middle
school level. Below is the WIAA rule prohibiting our high school coaches from working with middle-level students during these
middle school seasons. Our request to the school board is stated below, which would allow our High school coaches access to
middle-level students without violating WIAA rules.

WIAA Rule 17.5.9:
C. Public School District defined: The school district for public schools is defined by public
school boundaries.

1. If a school district has specific boundaries for its high school(s) and middle school(s), a high school
coach may coach students in the high school and the middle school(s) that feed directly to the high
school only during their designated season (when the high school and middle-level programs
overlap or if that coach has a written agreement with the school district to coach at both the high
school and middle level) or during the summer.
2. During the out-of-season time period, the coach could coach high school students attending a different high school or a
middle school that does not feed directly to the high school in which that coach was hired to coach.

3. If a school district has an open enrollment policy, then a high school coach may coach students in the high school in
which the coach is contracted to coach during the designated high school season, middle-level students within that
school district during the time period the high school and middle-level season overlap or if that coach contracted to coach
at both the high school and middle level, or during the summer.

Request to School Board:
The Athletics Department of the Bainbridge School district is requesting confirmation from the School Board that if the following
Middle School Sports were offered, they would be offered in the months detailed below which would allow High School coaches
to also coach the middle school teams This confirmation will also serve as the agreement required by the WIAA rule stated
above in subsection 1 which applies to our districts enrollment procedures.
Sports and Seasons per the local Middle school league Schedule:
Football - 10 weeks in March/April/May
Wrestling - 9 weeks in January/February/March
Baseball - 7 weeks in September/October
Softball - 7 weeks in September/October
Girls Soccer - 7 weeks in October/November/December

*Activities will be optional for coaches and students.
*Activities will be advertised widely and accessible to all students
*Activities will be separate from High school students.
*No additional costs to the district

Re: Spring 2024 School Board School Updates

Earlier this fall, the decision was made to not have each school publicly present their School Improvement Plan in light
of so much emotion and confusion related to possible school closure and consolidation facing our community. Now
that we are no longer considering school closure or consolidation, and instead are back on track with the great work
happening in schools, each of our seven BISD schoolswill attend a board meeting this spring to highlight the amazing
experiences of their students and steadfast dedication and tremendous talent of their staff.

Re:Policy 3415 Accommodating Students with Diabetes -First Reading
_________________________________________________________
Bainbridge Island School District has not yet adopted a policy specifically for the care of students with diabetes, although there
are clear practices for Individual Health Care Plans currently in place within our buildings that are monitored by the school
nurses. WSSDA (Washington State School Directors' Association) has a model policy, Policy 3415: Accommodating Students
With Diabetes, that is deemed essential and was last revised by WSSDA in December 2011. This policy was written in order to
be consistent with RCW 28A.210.330 (please see the board packet for this RCW), which provides guidance to school districts on
caring for students with diabetes, including the creation of Individual Health Care Plans, designation of a professional to consult
and coordinate with parents and the students health care provider, and training and supervision of school district personnel. This
policy has been reviewed with the registered nurse ESAs for input and is consistent with current BISD practices for caring for
students with diabetes.
I recommend approval of Policy 3415 Accommodating Students with Diabetes - First Reading.

Re: Policy 3420 Anaphylaxis - First Reading
_________________________________________________
I am bringing forward a revision to Policy 3420: Anaphylaxis Prevention and Response. WSSDA put out a model policy and
procedure in 2018, which largely included changes to the procedure that were in line with Policy 3419: Self-Administration of
Asthma and Anaphylaxis Medication which was approved earlier this year. Wording in this policy is changed slightly to clarify that
students can have an allergic reaction without a history of anaphylaxis and that the district will take precautions to reduce the risk
of exposure to allergens for students that do have a history of anaphylaxis. The WSSDA model policy submitted with the board
packet includes optional wording for districts that are stocking undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors, but at this time our
district is not stocking undesignated epinephrine in our health rooms.
I recommend approval of Policy 3420 Anaphylaxis Prevention and Response First Reading

Re: Policy 2401 Financial Education Mastery-Based Learning and Credit - Second Reading

Policy 2401 is a new policy to the Bainbridge Island School District. The policy clarifies that the district will promote financial
education to offer mastery-based credit for students who demonstrate theyve met the Washington State K12 Learning Standard
for financial education. Important to note, WAC 180-51-050 requires local school boards to adopt an authorizing policy before
districts can award mastery-based credit.
According to the policy, the district will encourage students to learn financial education effectively at a high level of proficiency.
The district also recognizes the importance of allowing students to learn at their own pace, and the educational benefits that can
be gained by giving students the opportunity to demonstrate competency of skills, proficiency of standards, and mastery of
concepts. This is an Encouraged policy.
I recommend the board approve the Second reading of Board Policy 2401 Financial Education Mastery-Based Learning and
Credit.

changes and answered board questions. Edits are noted on the 2nd reading 2413 policy update.
