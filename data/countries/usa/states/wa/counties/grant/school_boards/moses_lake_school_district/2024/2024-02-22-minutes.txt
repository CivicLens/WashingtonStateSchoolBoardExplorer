Mr. Ramirez's show of emotion caused Mr. Feldbush to want to keep fighting for public schools, even with the things coming down from the state level.
He expressed his appreciation to the Board for taking a stand.
  Information: B. Public Comments on Non-Agenda Items
  9. New Business
Presentation: A. School Resource Officers Presentation
Jeff Sursely gave a recent history of the SRO program and its progression. The SRO program is a triad of teachers/educators, counselors/mentors and law enforcement officers. The goal of the program is to provide safe learning environments and valuable resources to school staff members.  It is also to foster positive relationships with students and develop strategies to resolve problems that affect our youth, with the goal of protecting all children so they can reach their fullest potential.
Mr. Sursely went on to say the goal is to protect all people in the schools, not just students, but also staff.
Mr. Sursely noted that in 2021 several laws changed that had a significant impact on the SRO program and the schools. House Bill 1140 took away the ability for officers to interview and question juvenile suspects, which hindered the ability to investigate misdemeanor and felony level crimes in the schools. House Bill 1214 prohibits SROs from being involved in school or student discipline, which removes them from the mentorship role.
SROs have increased collaboration with the schools and administration.
Throughout his presentation, Mr. Sursely elaborated on how the goals are being met and what additions have been made to the program to enhance safety.
He mentioned that the SROs are involved in threat assessments. SROs are working to bring students back into the schools with the right tools and into the right environment to help them to be successful.  When necessary, they advocate for them not to be brought back in.
Mr. Fuhr asked the Cabinet how the SRO's are funded. It was noted the School Resource Officer Program is funded approximately 80% with levy dollars.
  Information: B. Budget Status Report
Stefanie Lowry, Finance Director, presented the November and December budget status reports. Ms. Lowry noted revenues are better than expenditures in both months.
Ms. Lowry drew the Board's attention to the ending fund balance. She explained the fund balance has been creeping up from 8.75% of total budgeted expenditures to 10.27%. Board Policy 6022 sets the goal of the fund balance to be at 12.5%. We are always working to be at that level. There was a push over a decade ago for districts to begin writing a policy for minimum fund balance. When we first set that policy it was at 8.33% which is the equivalent to one month of expenditures. A few years ago the Board raised that goal to 12.5%.
She stated payroll is up a bit and explained how supplemental contracts work, as well as contractual leave buybacks and the late ratification of the PSE contract effect payroll.
Ms. Lowry also shared the district is trending much better this year while she explained the chart comparison from last year to this year.
She went on to explain a few of the line items on the reports she shared.
  Presentation: C. Strategic Plan Indicator 4A Students meet social-emotional and behavioral expectations
Nick Bontrager shared the Indicator 4A--Students meet social-emotional and behavioral expectations.
The survey from which the data is gathered is from Center for Educational Effectiveness Survey.  This survey will be used again next year and that will be the end of our three year contract. This is a yearly survey for students, staff and families.
Mr. Bontrager answered Board member's questions. The test is given once a year to students beginning in fourth grade. It is a computer test and students who receive accommodations for assessments will also receive the same accommodation for this survey. Students are also given the option to take it in a language other than English, if necessary.
Mr. Bontrager noted we are implementing the data received into School Improvement Plans.
  Action, Information: D. Policy 3207 Prohibition of Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying
Triscia Hochstatter noted even though this MLSD policy was updated last May, it is being updated again after a recent WSSDA update.
Mr. Hill asked if we had policies in place to cover the staff in situations that Policy 3207 addressed prior to the update.  Ms. Hochstatter assured Mr. Hill that staff was covered in other policies.  Ms. Jensen asked what those policies are. Ms. Hochstatter will retrieve that information and get back to her.

Action: E. Replacement Educational Programs and Operations Levy Resolution 2024-02
Mr. Sabin noted that unfortunately the levy was not approved by the community members. Tomorrow, February 23, 2024 is not only the date to certify the election, but it is also the deadline to file to put the levy on the ballot in April. We don't want to delay putting this back on the ballot because budgeting for the district is done in the spring. Knowing with certainty the revenue the district has available is crucial for building the budget.
If levy dollars are lost, serious decisions will need to be made. In the 2024 school year, the levy was roughly 10% of our budget, which is about 15 million dollars.
Mr. Sabin stated if levy dollars are not available, it will impact our SRO staffing as well as goals tied to our strategic plan. Without that money we would have to make a number of difficult decisions concerning programming, staffing and the requirements built into negotiated agreements with staff and contracts. We need to know this information with certainty as early as possible, which is why the turn around to put it on the ballot is so quick.
The resolution is identical to the one approved a few months ago, except for the date. We put a lot of thought into the resolution and we are asking for what we need, not necessarily what we want. This is strictly maintaining programs and staffing that we currently have. The rate is at $2.00 because the regionalization money has dropped drastically since 2018. Our insurance has increased in the Moses Lake School District by $350,000. We are experiencing significant increases in our expenses.
Communities in Schools and Boys and Girls Clubs are both supported by levy funds as well as many other school programs. The community has made a significant investment into the buildings of the district and we maintain our buildings partly with levy dollars. If we don't consistently maintain our investment, our buildings will not be in great shape. To reiterate, the rate is staying at $2.00 due to loss of revenue and increased costs.
Mr. Hill asked if there is anything in place to find out why our community didn't pass the levy in February. Mr. Sabin noted a survey will be sent out to gather this information and allow us to tailor new communication to address those areas. As a school district we can only communicate facts. The citizens committee can do different things in communication.
Ms. Breitenstein asked if the levy would be on its own ballot. It is unclear at this time what else will be on the April ballot.
Ms. Breitenstein also mentioned that being visual with signage makes a big difference. Social media is also beneficial.
Mr. Sabin noted that all aspects are being reviewed.
The Board voted unanimously via roll call vote to approve Resolution 2024-02.
  Moved to accept Resolution 2024-02.
  Motion by Kevin Fuhr, second by Paul Hill.
Final Resolution: Motion Passes
Yea: Kevin Fuhr, Paul Hill, Kirryn Jensen, Amy Breitenstein, Carla Urias

Action: F. Resolution 2024-03 Local Control
Mr. Sabin presented Resolution 2024-03. The main focus of Resolution 2024-03 is local control. Specifically, it addresses Senate Bill 5462 and House Bill 2331. These bills impact our ability as Moses Lake School District to make local decisions to approve or disapprove certain materials, whether it be certain curriculum or material in our libraries.This resolution is addressing these two bills, but in general, it is advocating for local control. Local control has been encroached on in our state by legislation that has been passed restricting the school district's ability to make decisions and determinations that best match the values of our community. A number of schools in our region, eastern Washington, have recently adopted a local control resolution or are in the process of adopting it. These districts want to send a strong message that we value and want local control.
The Board discussed if anything else should be added to this resolution and it was decided nothing else would be added at this time.
This resolution was passed via a unanimous roll call vote.
  Motion to adopt Resolution 2024-03 Local Control.
  Motion by Paul Hill, second by Kevin Fuhr.
Final Resolution: Motion Passes
Yea: Kevin Fuhr, Paul Hill, Kirryn Jensen, Amy Breitenstein, Carla Urias

  Information: B. Board Comments
Ms. Breitenstein thanked the ASB Representatives for their reports. She went on to thank our School Resource Officers for their hard work.
Ms. Urias thanked the community for their comments. Ms. Urias also noted she feels we are uniting and heading in the right direction.
Mr. Fuhr reiterated how crucial the SROs are in our schools. It is important that they be employed to cover our schools, and for this to happen it is vital that levy dollars continue.
Mr. Hill gave a brief report of what the lawmakers in Olympia are considering.
Ms. Jensen thanked all for coming to the meeting and for those who gave input during public comment.
