The Bremerton School District Board of Directors held a regular meeting on September 19, 2024, where several key topics were discussed, including the first reading of Policy 3241 concerning Student Discipline. This policy aligns with OSPI's emergency rules, which introduce terms like "discretionary discipline" and "nondiscretionary discipline" to provide more flexibility in managing student behavior. The board also addressed the 2024-27 Bremerton Education Association Cooperative Working Agreement, which includes provisions for professional development and stipends for dual language and special education teachers. 

Additionally, the meeting included discussions on community engagement, particularly concerning field rental price increases and their potential impact on local clubs. Concerns about mental health were raised, with a focus on the importance of support systems for students. The board also received updates on summer learning programs that engaged 352 students and highlighted the district's commitment to special education through professional development for new teachers.
