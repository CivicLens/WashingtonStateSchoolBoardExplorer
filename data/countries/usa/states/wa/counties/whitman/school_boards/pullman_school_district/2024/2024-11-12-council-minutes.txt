M. Public Hearing
Finance Director Jeff Elbracht explained that per RCW 35.34, the City of Pullman must
adopt the 2025-2026 Biennial Budget in a timely manner. As such, the Pullman City
Council approved the Final 2025-2026 Budget Calendar on June 11, 2024.
Additionally, in accordance with RCW 84.55.120, a public hearing is to be held regarding
revenues before setting the yearly property tax levy. This public hearing occurred on
September 24, 2024.
Furthermore, RCW 35.34.110 requires the legislative body to hold a public hearing on the
budget so that any taxpayer may be heard for or against any part of the Mayor's Proposed
Budget. As such, this agenda item serves as the public hearing for the 2025-2026
Biennial Budget for the City Council to accept public comments before adopting the final
budget ordinance scheduled for Tuesday, November 19, 2024.
The City Clerk made proper legal notice for this item, advertised it on the City's website,
and publicized it on social media accounts.
Public Hearing: 1. Public Hearing for Mayor's Proposed 2025-2026 Biennial Budget
Mayor Benjamin opened the Public Hearing at 7:38 p.m.
Tathagata Pal, Vice President of Legislative Affairs for the Graduate and Professional
Student Association of Washington State University, thanked the city for providing
students with transportation services and asked for continued transit service with an
extension on available routes.
Mayor Benjamin asked if anyone else would like to comment on the 2025-2026 budget.
There were no other comments.
Mayor Benjamin closed the Public Hearing at 7:40 p.m.
N. Regular Agenda
Finance Director Jeff Elbracht explained that Chapter 251, Laws of 1995, codified as
RCW 84.55.120, requires a public hearing on revenue sources for the coming yearâ€™s
budget, including possible increases in property tax revenues.
This public hearing occurred on September 24, 2024. No public comment was offered,
and the Finance Department received no additional comments in the interim.
The Implicit Price Deflator (IPD) discussion occurred during that hearing. As per RCW
84.55.0101, when the IPD is above 1%, cities can only adopt to levy the 1% above the
highest lawful level since 1985 limit factor.
Although the City of Pullman has adopted a biennial budget process, property tax levies
are still set annually and recorded with the Whitman County Assessor on or before
November 30th of each calendar year, as per RCW 84.52.070.
Due to cost increases for the City of Pullman government operations to provide services
and programs to the community, staff is recommending:
1) Capturing additional new revenue resulting from all new construction,
improvements to property, changes in assessed value, and any annexations;
2) Increasing the prior year's levy amount by the statutory maximum rate of 1%
above the highest lawful levy since 1985
For the regular levy, this amount would be:

2024 Highest Lawful Levy Since 1985: 7,744,236.78 x 1.01 = $7,821,679.15
2024 New Construction Projected Levy Amount = $123,382.58
Total to be collected for 2025 = $7,945,061.73
Preliminary Budget for 2025 Property Tax Levy = $7,867,336
The repayment schedule for principal and interest sets the excess levy of $1,043,342 to
repay the 2018 bond items.
Action: 1.
ORDINANCE NO. 24-12 - AN ORDINANCE FIXING THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX
LEVY FOR THE YEAR 2024 FOR COLLECTION IN 2025 TO RAISE REVENUE
TO MEET ESTIMATED EXPENDITURES AND ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL
LEVY TO MEET GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND DEBT SERVICE
OBLIGATIONS.
Motion by Eric Fejeran, second by Ann Parks.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Pat Wright, Megan Guido, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira, Trymaine
Gaither
Finance Director Jeff Elbracht explained that the same law applies to Ordinance No. 2413 as previously explained in Ordinance No. 24-12. A public hearing on this occurred on
September 24, 2024. No public comment was offered, and the Finance Department
received no additional comments.
For the regular levy, this amount would be:
2024 highest lawful levy of $1,068,000.08 x 1.01% = $1,078,680.08
2024 New Construction Projected Levy Amount = $16,683.20
Total to be collected for 2025 = $1,095,363.28
Preliminary Budget for 2025 Property Tax Levy = $1,321,665
Action: 2.
ORDINANCE NO. 24-13 - AN ORDINANCE FIXING THE AMOUNT OF THE
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TAX LEVY FOR THE YEAR 2024 FOR
COLLECTION IN 2025 TO RAISE REVENUE TO MEET ESTIMATED
EXPENDITURES.
