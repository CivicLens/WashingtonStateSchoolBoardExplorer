  2. Good News
A. Teacher Appreciation Week
The Board of Directors acknowledged Teacher Appreciation Week which will be observed May 4-8, with National Teacher Day on May 5. Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger described his appreciation for the district's dedicated teaching staff who have risen to the occasion to facilitate the delivery of a remote learning program during the current pandemic emergency closure. At an online Staff Q&A session on April 22, Dr. Granger will announce the Lynden Masons Educator of the Year recipient for the 2019-20 school year. Director Lotze added commendation for the perseverance of teachers during this challenging time.
  3. Reports
A. Enrollment Update
Due to the emergency closure of school facilities, and changes in reporting, enrollment reports will no longer be available for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. Dr. Granger described the method to be used for creating an enrollment projection for April, May, and June based upon historical trends from past years. That enrollment projection will be used in calculating apportionment funding. Discussion followed, and Dr. Granger indicated that no negative impact on funding is anticipated.
  B. Budget Status and Financial Report
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided a financial report which the directors reviewed prior to the meeting. Due to the governor's stay-home order, Ms. Porter was not present to make a formal presentation. Dr. Granger pointed out that the district has recently experienced a higher-than-normal postage expense due to the mailing of learning packets. The district has also purchased flash drives and other tools in support of distance learning. There was discussion regarding the anticipation of significant budget shortfalls at the state level in coming years which will need to be addressed by the legislature in their 2021 budget session.
  C. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger reviewed recent updates to the district's High School Graduation Requirements procedure (2410P). He expressed appreciation to the staff members who assisted in the complex task of applying WSSDA's recommendations to the district's procedural language. The procedure does not require formal approval but was provided for the board's review and information.

Updates to the 2019-20 school calendar were reviewed with the last day of school extended to June 19. Dr. Granger indicated that formal board approval of the updates may not be required but is being requested to align with past practice.

Formal distance learning started on April 13, and continuous learning opportunities are ongoing. Some students are receiving paper packets due to accessibility challenges or personal preference, and the first packets are being turned in now. Teachers are now able to utilize Google Meet to hold virtual meetings with students. Guidelines for this practice have been provided, and participants in those virtual meetings must gain access through their district Google account.

Because school facilities will now remain closed for the rest of 2019-20, efforts are underway to return students' personal items which were left behind in desks and lockers. Staff are working to prepare for this, but the district will not announce a plan for pick-up until status of the governor's stay-at-home is determined.

Summer cleaning work is set to start on May 4, and the additional time in May and June will be utilized to perform maintenance and upgrade projects (e.g. painting, etc.) that there would not typically be time for during the summer months. Classified staff will be able to provide assistance in this work as part of their contract hours. Dr. Granger stressed the importance of bringing the facilities into pristine appearance in order to give a glowing welcome to staff and students when they are finally able to return to the buildings.

The district will be applying to the State Board of Education for the ability to waive graduation requirements for seniors who, as of March 13, were on track (or on a plan that would put them on track) to graduate on time. Blaine High School counselors have a list of all deficiencies, and they are tracking the needs of students.

Ground work is underway on the Field Turf project with the base layer of sand being applied now. Thanks to good weather and the lack of interruptions, this project is moving forward on schedule and expected to conclude by the end of July.

Dr. Granger and Ms. Porter have completed architect interviews for a 5-year contract to do project work as needed, which was authorized by the board at the January meeting. Zervas Architects has been selected, with King Architecture as backup.
  Staffing adjustments for the 2020-21 school year were described, including the transition of TOSA positions to administrative support in assistant principal roles at the building level. There was also discussion regarding additional CTE courses to be offered at Blaine High School. Business and sports medicine courses will be added next year, with no increased cost to the district. However, law enforcement and welding courses require facility preparations that cannot be completed at this time due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Implementation of those courses will be delayed until 2021-22. The middle school and high school are also slated for transition to a 7-period day in the 2021-22 school year. Discussions have been underway with Whatcom Community College to also offer a nursing program as early as 2021-22 which will operate similarly to the welding program at Meridian. Director McKinney asked if Blaine students would continue to be sent to Meridian for welding next year, and discussion followed regarding preparations that need to be in place prior to implementing a welding program at Blaine High School. Director McKinney added that welding and nursing will reach kids from a different group than business classes. Director Nunamaker asked about expected participation for athletic training, and discussion followed regarding the high level of interest in that course. President Gibson asked for clarification regarding the transition to a 7-period school day, and the discussion included examples of how schedules might be arranged. Director McKinney asked about the CTE business course to be offered next year, and Dr. Granger provided a description.

A School Board Retreat was still tentatively scheduled for May 16 depending on whether or not Governor Inslee's stay-at-home order is lifted.

Of the many bills vetoed by Governor Inslee last week, some included funding for elementary school counselors and para-educator training.

Adoption of these WSSDA recommended policies was considered in order to address the needs of the Class of 2020 in response to the State Board of Education's "Emergency Rules for Waiver of Certain Graduation Requirements in Response to Novel Coronavirus". WAC 180-51-050 requires local school boards to adopt an authorizing policy before districts can award competency-based credit to students. Dr. Granger confirmed that the district can remove these policies after the pandemic if there is no longer a desire to provide credit for competency/proficiency in these subject areas. The board, in a single motion, approved "First Reading" of the following new policies, related to credit for competency/proficiency in these required subject areas:
2402 Credit for Competency/Proficiency in English Language Arts
2403 Credit for Competency/Proficiency in Math
2404 Credit for Competency/Proficiency in Science

  6. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)
A. General Comments
Director McKinney asked for a summary of what the district has gained from experiences related to the current pandemic emergency. Dr. Granger commented on the opportunity to reach students in a unique circumstance in a manner very different than traditional classroom instruction. Teachers and students are building stronger proficiency in the use of online tools. The district's transition to Google for Education in December of 2019 has proved to be very fortuitous now that the Google platform has become the primary medium for delivering educational service. Discussion continued regarding options that may continue to be utilized in the future as alternative learning methods. Students are also gaining a new appreciation for the experience of learning in a classroom setting and for the support they typically receive in person on campus. The need for increased broadband in our rural areas was addressed. Dr. Granger expects to see new ways of thinking as well as a new wave of educational opportunity resulting from this experience.

Director Nunamaker asked if student participation online is comparable to prior classroom attendance, and discussion followed. Many students are receiving hard copy packets instead of online learning, whether by choice or by necessity due to lack of internet access.

President Gibson requested an update, at a future meeting, on Senate Bill 5395 regarding sex education and the impact to Blaine School District. Dr. Granger reminded the board that the district's current Flash curriculum is approved for use under the new mandate. He will provide additional information on this matter at the May meeting.
  B. Future Meeting(s) and Agenda Suggestions
A Board Retreat was being planned for Saturday, May 16, 2020. If that activity will take place, a public notice will be provided no later than the previous week.

The next regular board meeting will be on a Tuesday due to the Memorial Day holiday. A School Improvement Plan (SIP) update work session for board members and building administrators was scheduled to take place at 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, May 26, 2020. If remote participation continues to be required, Dr. Granger proposed a change in the work session's start time to 6:00 p.m. and he will provide a summative end-of-year review for PreK-12 programming. The regular board meeting will follow at 7:00 p.m. on that date. Suggested agenda items were reviewed. 
  7. Executive Session
A. Executive Session
At 8:11 p.m., President Gibson announced that the Board would move into executive session for the purpose of considering the employment of personnel.

Dr. Granger moved from the boardroom to his office for executive session discussion away from the telephone.
  8. Reconvene & Adjourn
