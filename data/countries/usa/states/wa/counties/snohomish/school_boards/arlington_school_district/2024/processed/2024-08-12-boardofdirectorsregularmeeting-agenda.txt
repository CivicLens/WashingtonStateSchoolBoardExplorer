Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulg√°b).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time
immemorial and their ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice
the traditional ways of their ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural
traditions passed on to them by their ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these
lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its
Indigenous people, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history,
and can demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the June Budget Reports as
presented.

Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
Budget Reports - June:
Fund balance and net cash: As of June 2024, fund balance is temporarily negative -$2.5 million (compared to $912,520 last June 2023) and
net cash is approximately $2.4 million (compared to $3.3 million last June 2023). The net cash balance during the month of June is a positive
balance due to the interfund loan from the Capital Projects Fund in the amount of $2,623,685.
Consistent with prior year trends, fund balance, net cash, and revenues show a large spike in October and April from receipt of a large
portion of local property taxes. The months following these large influxes show declines especially since the state apportionment allocation in
November and May is only 5%, and June is only 6% of the total allocation versus 9% in most of the other months. While it is consistent with

the normal pattern at this time of year, it is at a significantly lower balance across this fiscal year than in prior years. Expenditures remain at
a fairly consistent monthly level. A short-term temporary interfund loan from the Capital Projects was not necessary for the months of
January, February, or March. A short-term temporary interfund loan from Capital Projects was approved by Board Resolution 24-07 for the
month of June. June is the lowest point in the year for fund balance. Projections for July indicate a very narrow margin in covering current
month obligations. Accordingly, an additional interfund loan from Capital Projects was approved by Board Resolution 24-10 for the remainder
of of the fiscal year. This need is due to the timing and receipt of revenue accruals for the 2023-24 fiscal year which won't be fully received
until the fiscal year is closed.
Current projections estimate the district will have an ending fund balance of around $1 million (depending on the Safety Net grant award for
special education costs) for the 2023-24 fiscal year. This figure also assumes the District has made repayment of all funds loaned from the
Capital Projects Fund.
Local Tax Revenue: The district has received 98.73% of total budgeted General Fund tax revenues for the 2023-24 fiscal year. Tax
revenues received year-to-date amount to $9.5 million.
Expenditures: As of June, 97% of total budgeted expenditures is either spent or obligated through purchase order/encumbrances. However,
this includes $5M in budget capacity affiliated with contingency for lease accounting which are book entries only. In reality nearly 100% of
budgeted expenditures is either spent or obligated through purchase orders/encumbrances. This doesn't include things not typically
encumbered such as timesheet work, and goods purchased using procurement card. This is due to a number of departments that have
outstanding purchase orders/encumbrances that are taking them beyond their allowed budget. Those departments include, Special
Education, District-wide Support, Food Services, and Pupil Transportation. This may be due to open PO's that are larger than needed that
are not actually going to be fully utilized. These departments need to perform further review of their open PO's to determine what can be
closed. Finance will also be reviewing and inquiring with those departments. We are closely monitoring spending trends, and were expecting
restraint given the communications about the status of our budget and fund balance.

Board acceptance of Budget Reports for May 2024 occurred at the July 8, 2024, Board of Directors regular meeting.

Washington State statute and Arlington Public Schools Board Policy dictate that the 2024-25 Arlington School District Budget be adopted by
