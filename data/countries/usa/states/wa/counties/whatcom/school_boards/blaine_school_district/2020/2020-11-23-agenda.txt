Public Content
In October of 2011, WSSDA released a large set of policy manual revisions. Included in those revisions
were corrections, updates, and the elimination of policies and procedures that were deemed to no longer
be needed. In that months issue of Policy News, WSSDA explained, Some policies had become obsolete
and were no longer necessary to retain at a policy level. Some smaller policies were absorbed into
another policy when the content covered the same issue.
This action item is specific to policy updates referenced on the attached memorandum which summarizes
each update for consideration. As such, the board is asked to approve "First Reading" of updates to the
policies listed below. The procedures do not require formal approval but are provided for additional
review and information. The Board will be asked to approve "Second Reading" and adoption of these
policy updates, in the Consent Agenda, at the December meeting.

addressed elsewhere, such as the districts Strategic Plan where social emotional learning is addressed (i.
e. character, diversity, and culture). Other deleted content simply no longer needs to be retained at a
