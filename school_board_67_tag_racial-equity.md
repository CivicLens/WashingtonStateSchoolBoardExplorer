The meeting minutes detail a regular school board meeting held on September 10, 2020, via Zoom.  The board discussed and approved several items related to the reopening of schools amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This included approving MB Resolution 20/21:1, which likely outlined protocols for reopening and potentially addressed suspension of existing policies due to the pandemic.

The meeting also featured a presentation on social-emotional learning (SEL) from a presenter identified only as "a presenter."  This suggests a potential focus on student mental health and well-being in the context of returning to school during a challenging time. 

Finally, the minutes mention discussions regarding racial equity, though specific details about these conversations are not provided. This could indicate an ongoing effort by the school board to address systemic inequities within the district.
