## 2024-03-11 - LA_CONNER_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The La Conner School Board held a special study meeting on March 11, 2024, where various topics including student attendance, extracurricular activities, and curriculum engagement were discussed. The board highlighted significant absenteeism issues among students, particularly in morning classes, and proposed potential solutions such as incentives for perfect attendance and the option for students to attend classes via Zoom. Additionally, the board addressed requests for more extracurricular activities and academic support, including the establishment of study halls. 

The board also reviewed multiple policies, with a specific focus on Policy 1450, which is proposed to be revised to reduce the number of consecutive meeting absences required for board members from four to three. Concerns regarding school safety and bullying were raised, along with a request to reintroduce security personnel on campus. The meeting emphasized community engagement, particularly in understanding why families choose to transfer their students out of the district, with 55 to 60 students reported to have done so. The board plans to follow up with families to gather more insights.

## 2024-02-26 - LA_CONNER_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The La Conner School Board held a regular meeting on February 26, 2024, where community engagement was a significant focus, particularly regarding the future of the varsity football program. Several community members expressed their support for maintaining the football program, citing its importance for student retention and community traditions. In response to concerns about low participation numbers, Athletic Director Christine Tripp proposed options for the football program, which included playing an independent 8-man season or combining with Anacortes. The board ultimately voted to pursue the independent 8-man league option and to form a committee to establish actionable benchmarks for the football program. Additionally, the board approved several resolutions, including Resolution #24-02, which waives instructional days for parent-teacher conferences, despite opposition from President Deyo, who emphasized the need for classroom learning on those days. Other resolutions included the approval of donations from the La Conner Rotary and the surplusing of buses and a vehicle.

## 2024-02-12 - LA_CONNER_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The La Conner School Board of Directors held a special study meeting on February 12, 2024, where they discussed various topics, including site visits to math classrooms and personnel actions. The board approved travel requests for staff to attend the Innovative Schools Summit in New York, highlighting the need for community engagement and input regarding the football program, especially after WIAA denied the petition for an 8-person football team.

Additionally, the board reviewed School Improvement Plans (SIPs) and noted a 6% increase in graduation rates, emphasizing the importance of addressing teacher-staff shortages and improving academic standards.
