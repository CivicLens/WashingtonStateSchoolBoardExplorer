AGENDA ITEM:
Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Project Budget Closeouts
AGENDA ITEM:
As part of the project budget process several projects have been completed and the project budgets
need to be closed out. Projects have varying situations that arise during the course of a project such as
unforeseen conditions, change in scope of work or requirements mandated by regulatory inspectors and
these factors can increase the costs of a project. The unused funds from projects help cover the
overages in others as long as the project is in the same capital funding source. Attached is a recap of the
projects ready for close out at this time, one list for 2016 Bond projects and the other is the construction
levy projects.
BOARD GOAL:
Goal 3: Building Equitable Systems and School Environments
BUDGET IMPLICATION:
With closing out the project budget listed on the 2016 Bond projects list, $1,253,060.38 will be returned to
the 2016 Bond Issue contingency. The construction levy projects that are listed to be closed will return
$1,757,574.64 to the contingency.
There are still current bond project budgets that are open, and the funds being returned to the
contingencies do not reflect available funding.

RECOMMENDATION:
That the board of directors approve this item.

Network Cabling Capacity Improvement - Phase 1

AGENDA ITEM:
The Kent School District network now supports well over 60,000 network connected devices (desktops,
laptops, phones, printers, intercom system devices, etc.) It is imperative that our network systems are
upgraded periodically to handle the increasing bandwidth demands that we place on it. We plan to
upgrade 18 of our locations (all secondary schools, the central office, and transportation) to bring our
current wiring up to modern day standards. This project will be funded by the existing technology levy,
with up to 80% (of qualifying locations) being funded through the E-RATE (no acronym definition)
program.
Specific cabling to be refreshed includes:
Fiber optic cabling between all wiring closets within each building (12 strand single-mode)
Ethernet cabling to each wireless access points (2 each category 6a)
Ethernet cabling to each clock/intercom unit throughout each building (1 each category 6e)
Limited Ethernet cabling for future access control and security camera systems.
Associated cable type patch panels, racks, cable terminations, cable pathway
improvements, and related supplies.
Proposal Process:
Issuing a Request For Proposal (form 470) through the Universal Service Administrative Company/ERATE program to solicit added capacity wiring for Copper and Fiber cabling at 18 of our district
locations. Phase 2 of this program is scheduled for next year to address all remaining locations (all
elementary schools). As advised by our counsel at Perkins Coie, we will be utilizing RCW
39.04.270 for the procurement of this work.
