G. City Council and Mayor Future Regular Agenda Requests
Councilmember Fejeran requested an agenda item regarding the design change order for
Project Downtown and the criteria. He also requested a Council meeting on March 19, 2024, to
discuss the process.
City Administrator Mike Urban advised that staff had not planned on a Council meeting next
week due to a lack of agenda items and that creating a full agenda for next week would be

impossible; however, if the Council wanted to have a meeting on March 19, staff would create
an agenda with the one discussion item.
The Council discussed meeting on March 19, 2024 but ultimately decided Welch Comer would
not have any design change requests reviewed and evaluated before next week’s meeting, and
it would be a better use of staff and Council time to wait until March 26 and have an agenda item
to discuss the process further.
Councilmember Fejeran withdrew his motion for a meeting on March 19, 2024, and proposed
having a discussion item on March 26 on the design and design change orders process.
Councilmember Guido seconded the motion.

Code Enforcement Supervisor Liz Oje explained that the Pullman City Code governs the Code

N. Regular Agenda
City of Pullman Building Official Jeromy Moore explained that the State of Washington chose
March 15, 2024, as the effective date for the updates on the Washington State Building Building
Code. Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 19.97 requires cities and counties to adopt and
enforce the Washington Building Code. Historically, the new codes have been implemented
every three years, which would have originally made the effective date of the 2021 codes July
1, 2023. Due to pending litigation, the Washington State Building Code Council (SBCC) delayed
the effective date to October 29, 2023, and then delayed it again to March 15, 2024.
The Washington State Building Code consists of five (5) model codes with state amendments.
The model codes are the International Building Code (IBC), International Residential Code
(IRC), International Mechanical Code (IMC), International Fuel Gas Code (IFGC) published by
the International Code Council, and the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) published by the
International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials. The State of Washington has
amended all of the model codes. The Washington State Energy Code is stand-alone. The State
of Washington adopts the National Electrical Code (NEC) but is not part of the Washington State
Building Code. These codes are adopted in the city’s Construction Code, Title 2 of the Pullman
City Code (PCC).
Title 2 has several minor revisions, including references to the new code editions being the most
current edition adopted by the State of Washington and removing the City of Pullman gas fitter’s
license requirement (in addition to the state-recognized trade license requirements). Attached
is a copy of Title 2 of the PCC showing the proposed additions or deletions to the Construction
Code.
Regular Agenda, Action, Ordinance: 1.

PULLMAN, WHITMAN COUNTY, WASHINGTON, AMENDING PULLMAN CITY CODE

Parks and Facilities Director Kurt Dahmen explained On August 19, 2023, Chipman Trail Bridge
#5 (located between Alpine Animal Hospital - 4853 WA-270 & 5101 WA-270) was damaged by
an arson fire. The bridge was not covered under Whitman County’s liability insurance coverage
(consistent with all bridges in their transportation network). The Whitman County Bridge Crew
Foreman inspected the bridge and determined it needed to be replaced.
On March 12, 1997, the City of Pullman, City of Moscow, Washington State University, University
of Idaho, and Whitman County agreed to share maintenance and operation costs and implement
operational procedures for the Palouse Trail, aka Chipman Trail.
The agreement
further established a committee known as the Palouse Trail Committee (PTC), which consists
of five members, with one representing each entity. Currently, each entity contributes $10,000
annually to a fund that provides routine maintenance and builds a reserve fund for future capital
projects.
Section 3.3 of the agreement between entities states, “From time to time, there may be a need
to expend funds for (such things as bridge maintenance or replacement, path reconstruction, or
renovation) ”capital costs” that exceed the amount available from annual contributions. In these
cases, each “Entity” may be approached with a request from the PTC for additional contributions
and may participate on a case-by-case basis.”
At the February 13, 2024, Palouse Trail Committee meeting, members agreed to request each
entity’s governing/legislative bodies for $40,000 towards the replacement cost of the bridge, with
$50,000 being used from existing trail fund reserves. At the February 14, 2024, Parks &
Recreation Commission meeting, committee members passed a motion recommending
approving $40,000 funding from Pullman, but not with Metro-Parks funds.
The estimated cost of replacement of the bridge is $250,000. Whitman County is leading the
bridge project, and its bridge crew will perform the work. Whitman County Commissioners
support this proposal and are willing to contribute their share of $40,000 to the project and are
also willing to cover any costs beyond $250,000.
This expenditure is not budgeted in 2024, and a future budget amendment is expected at the
end of the year.
Regular Agenda, Action, Resolution: 2.
RESOLUTION NO. R-14-24 - A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE PAYMENT OF
$40,000.00 TO WHITMAN COUNTY FOR THE CHIPMAN TRAIL BRIDGE
REPLACEMENT PROJECT.
Motion by Megan Guido, second by Eric Fejeran.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Pat Wright, Megan Guido, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira, Trymaine Gaither
Geographic Information Systems Administrator Sam Jenkins explained that since the
Geographic Information System Program’s inception before the successful growth of the
program, the existing licensing is no longer sufficient for current use and anticipated growth.
The cost of continuing to purchase the required software and licenses piecemeal will exceed the
cost of the enterprise agreement negotiated with Esri, the software vendor.
Funds budgeted in 2024 cover the cost of the first year of the agreement. Funding for the
remaining two years would be addressed in the 2025-2026 budget process.

Implementing GIS at the City of Pullman has transformed how we use data to monitor city
resources, make data-driven decisions, and communicate. The program’s successful growth
has meant the existing licensing is insufficient for current use and anticipated growth.
The City of Pullman GIS provides desktop mapping and analysis software to power users,
provides GIS data and map servers to integrated business systems, and provides a web portal
for users to view, create, and analyze spatial data to manage City resources under their care
more effectively, and provides mobile GIS applications so field crews can maintain operational
views of systems under their care.
Funds for an SGEA were allocated during the 2023-2024 budgeting process. Esri has offered
the City of Pullman a ramped entry into the SGEA three-year commitment at considerable
savings.
The benefits of the SGEA include unlimited desktop licenses for growing numbers of users
producing high-quality maps and maintaining complex data sets such as utility networks, land
parcel fabrics, and road condition asset management. Additional server licenses will be required
to support existing business system integrations and new servers for anticipated roles in asset
management software. It has sophisticated analytic tool licenses that expand the return on
investment made in creating data. Reduced costs of license administration. Expanded access
for users of the WebGIS to create and maintain spatial information.
Regular Agenda, Action, Resolution: 3.
RESOLUTION NO. R-15-24 - A RESOLUTION WAIVING PUBLIC BIDDING AND
AUTHORIZING SELECTION OF SOLE SOURCE GIS SOFTWARE PROVIDER.
Motion by Ann Parks, second by Megan Guido.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Pat Wright, Megan Guido, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira, Trymaine Gaither
City of Pullman Building Official Jeromy Moore explained that Permit fee schedules are set by
the City Council by Resolution per City of Pullman Construction Code sections 2.15.020,
2.20.020, and 2.25.020. The last time permit fees were revised was in 2021. Below is a brief
explanation of the fee changes proposed.
Demolition Permit: Demolition permits can require increased staff time and resources to
safeguard the public. The graduated fee schedule for commercial structures (IBC) offsets the
cost of pre-construction meetings, site inspections, and pedestrian safety plan reviews while
keeping residential (IRC) demolition permits flat rate unchanged.
Retaining Wall Permit: Currently, permits are calculated by multiplying the square footage of
the wall by $15.00 to establish the valuation of the wall. Contractor-estimated valuations are
often three to five times higher than our calculated value and sometimes as much as eight times.
Increasing the multiplier to $30.00 would offset the cost of the structural review, field inspections,
and special inspection supervision required while still keeping the value substantially less than
the contractor valuation.
Adult Family Home Permit: This is meant to keep the permit inexpensive and flat rate to
facilitate the need for Adult Family Home care facilities. When converting a single-family home
to an Adult Family Home, a change of occupancy is needed. Also, reviews and inspections are
needed to ensure that the facility meets the life/safety requirements of the State Licensed Care
Facility.
Residential Rooftop Solar Permit: This proposal is meant to keep the permit inexpensive and
flat rate to facilitate renewable energy in residential settings. Currently, the valuation of the
project is used. The values can vary from $8,000-$20,00 as an example. A flat rate permit
would offset city resources reviewing, permitting, and inspecting while keeping the permit
inexpensive regardless of the valuation.
Signs: Currently, there is no clear fee structure to capture the time and resources needed for
plan review, permitting, and inspecting signs as a structure. A sign permit would give clear

direction for permitting signs mechanically fastened to buildings and as separate structures such
as monuments, poles, and pedestals.
Foundation permits: The “foundation only” permit has not been utilized in my tenure. The
“Early start/Phase permit” currently facilitates citizens who wish to perform phased construction.
Deletion of this portion would remove confusion and redundancies.
Action, Resolution, Regular Agenda: 4.
RESOLUTION NO. R-16–24 - A RESOLUTION UPDATING FEES RELATED TO
BUILDING PERMITS, PLUMBING PERMITS, AND MECHANICAL PERMITS.
Motion by Megan Guido, second by Ann Parks.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Pat Wright, Megan Guido, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira, Trymaine Gaither
City Administrator Mike Urban explained while preparing for Project Downtown to commence in
April 2024 that city staff has been meeting regularly since 2023Q3 to address transportation and
parking activities expected to be disrupted during construction build-out.
These meetings resulted in an initial parking and transportation plan, which was vetted by the
Project Manager, Welch Comer, and presented to the Mayor & City Council on February 27,
2024. The Project Manager refined the plan with the contractor, Apollo Inc., and debuted it
publicly at an open house event on February 29, 2024.
As part of staff discussion and discussed during the initial presentation to the City Council on
February 27th, staff recommends the creation of a project-specific Ad-Hoc Parking and
Transportation Committee with certain authorities for the duration of the project.
This recommendation’s importance centers around the ability to respond efficiently and react
quickly to unanticipated issues and changing conditions that may arise during project
construction and to maintain and maximize services and operations by addressing temporary
solutions in the affected area.
The recommended affected area is the C-2 zone. This area was selected because it is already
defined and encompasses most of the activity that the project is anticipated to affect, and existing
codes, ordinances, and resolutions regulate parking in this area.
As previously presented to the City Council, the recommended members of this committee
remain:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Mayor, acting as Chairperson - (Francis Benjamin)
City Councilmember appointed as Mayor Pro-Tempore (Pat Wright)
City Councilmember appointed as Alternate Mayor Pro-Tempore (Eric Fejeran)
Chief of Police (Jake Opgenorth)
City Engineer (Cara Haley)
Fire Marshal (Darren Jones)

The Project Manager will make available the email address Info@ProjectDowntownPullman.org for
the community to communicate any requests for changes the Ad Hoc Parking and
Transportation Committee should take under consideration. To help the Project Manager
expedite such requests promptly, please start the email’s subject line with either Parking or
Transportation. Furthermore, staff will create a landing page on the city website to explain this
process, provide appropriate links outlining activities, and catalog the committee’s actions.
City Administrator Mike Urban further explained that the Ad-Hoc committee is operational, and
it would look inappropriate to have members of the public or business owners sit on the
committee. And the committee was created to move quickly when an issue arises.
Regular Agenda, Action, Resolution: 5.

Executive Session pursuant to RCW 42.30.110(1)(c) to consider the minimum price at which
real estate will be offered for sale or lease when public knowledge regarding such consideration
would cause a likelihood of decreased price, provided final action selling or leasing public
property shall be taken in a meeting open to the public.
The Executive Session is expected to last approximately 10 minutes. If it becomes necessary
