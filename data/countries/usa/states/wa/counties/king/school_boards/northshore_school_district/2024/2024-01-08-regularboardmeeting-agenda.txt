COMMENT

Information

Public Content
Summary:
The Northshore School District Board of Directors has set aside a period of up to 60 minutes to receive updates and comments
fromDistrictassociation leaders and community members.As referenced in multiple policies adopted by The Board, we expect all parties
addressing the Board to present their comments in a way that is civil and respectful. This means that whether we are school directors,
district staff, students, members of the community, or some other guest, we must all follow the same standard of civility during school board
meetings. Please speak directly to the Board and address matters related to district operations, policies, procedures, and agenda items
under consideration by the Board.
Washington State law requires that the Board limit its business and discussionat the Board meetingto onlythoseitems that have been
captured in the previously published agenda. What that means for us today:
Any public comment regarding itemsthat are includedin the published agenda will be taken into consideration by the Board when the
topic is addressed during the agenda.
Any topics brought up during public comment that are notincludedin the published agenda cannot, by law, be discussed at this
meeting and so will not be addressed or receive a response during the meeting.
In either case, depending on the nature ofyourtopic or questions,a district employee or a board member will follow up onany comments that
relate to district business.Please note that the boards silence during public comment is neutral. It is neither a signal of agreement nor
disagreement with the speakers remarks.
Also please note that comments should not make referenceto any employee or representative of the Districtby name or by identifiable
reference.If you are interested in makingcomments or complaints regardingan individual, you may use thecomplaint process available
through the Office of the Superintendent.
Finally, please remember that your words have impact and you, not the school district, are responsible for your words. We caution all
speakers that it is possible that your statements could violate the rights of others under various laws, including laws protecting privacy and
laws prohibiting defamation. If you are unsure of the legal effect of your remarks, you should seek independent legal advice. In any case, we
ask that you help us model for our students what a respectful and inclusive community looks and sounds like.

Public Content
Summary:
Capital Projects, in collaboration with our General Contractor/Construction Manager (GC/CM) partner
Cornerstone General Contractors, has strategically chosen to enact preemptive measures to counteract
potential increases in equipment costs resulting from inflation in construction materials and persistent
supply chain challenges. To facilitate this initiative, we are proactively securing required electrical gear in
advance. This strategy aims to assist in our ability to adhere to the current budget and schedule for the
Leota MS Phase 1 replacement project and will involve the signing of Amendment #1. We anticipate that
a total of three (3) additional Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendments will be executed in order to
establish the overall Guaranteed Maximum Price for the project. Amendment #1 will specifically authorize
the involvement of a competitively selected electrical sub-contractor and allow procurement of equipment.
Amendment #1 and supporting documents are attached for your review.
