3. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
Discussion: 3.01 Review and Approve the District's Reopening Plan for Fall Based
on the Newest Health Information
Mr. McLaurin said we learned that Dr. Quinn and other superintendents in
Whatcom County would be meeting with the Whatcom County Health

Department today; the 60 members of the Reopening Task Force were
holding their 5th meeting this evening; therefore, we decided to hold a special
meeting so that we could hear the latest recommendations from the health
department, task force, and district administration.
Dr. Quinn said 5 officials from the Whatcom County Health Department met
with the 7 superintendents of Whatcom County at 1:00 today. The purpose of
the meeting was for Dr. Stern to tell the superintendents that he would be
issuing a letter to all the superintendents strongly recommending that we do
not commence with in-person learning in September.
Dr. Quinn said Dr. Stern talked about the rationale for his decision which is
based on the growing number of cases and a trajectory that is going in the
wrong direction. She said most of the districts up and down the I-5 corridor
on the west side of the state have made a similar statement.
Dr. Quinn said Dr. Stern talked about the metric of 25 cases per population of
100,000 in a 14-day period:
• 25 cases or lower would be considered safe to open for in-person
learning
• 26-74 cases would allow for in-person learning under certain
conditions
• At 75 or more cases, the health department would recommend shutting
things down.
Dr. Quinn said right now in Whatcom County the rate per 100,000 in a 14-day
period is 63. She said Dr. Stern told us today the trend line and the number of
contacts per new cases is going in the wrong direction. She said knowing that
school districts have to make a decision, it was his strong recommendation to
move forward with plans for a virtual opening for all or most students in fall.
Dr. Quinn shared this information with the reopening task force during
tonight’s meeting. Although they did not have a formal recommendation,
there was a resignation that it would be hard to go against a strong
recommendation for the health and safety of our community.
Dr. Quinn asked for comments and questions from the Board.

Mr. McLaurin asked if it is accurate that there are hotspots in the Ferndale,
Custer, Lynden area. Dr. Quinn said that is pretty accurate and shared the
charts that are available on the Whatcom County Health Department website
which show a graphical representation of cases over the last 2 weeks.
Ms. Melinda Cool said she’d like for people to see how quickly the number of
cases has gone up over the last couple months even though it is summer and
more people are wearing masks and social distancing more often.
After a discussion regarding this new information, the Board gave their
approval and support to move forward with distance learning in the fall.
Dr. Quinn said there was a question submitted during the board meeting
asking if the health department differentiated anything about young students.
Dr. Quinn said the health department did talk about new research on
transmission by children and referenced several studies during the meeting
today. She said most people in the health department are still in agreement
that young people manifest symptoms less often, but they are still
transmitters of the virus.
Dr. Quinn said we will notify district staff tonight, send communication out
to our district families tomorrow and send out a media release. She said we
also have Facebook live on Thursday at 4:00 where we will entertain
questions about this from the community.
