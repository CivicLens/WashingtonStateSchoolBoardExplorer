Title II-A and Title IV-A funds will be used for professional development to improve effective instruction and safe and supportive learning environments.
  B. Elementary School Improvement Plan
Mrs. Cox, Mrs. Rushing and Mrs. Souza presented the elementary school improvement plan for 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. The plan will focus on a positive school climate, positive communications to staff students and community about current activities and successes and reviewing testing data to make sure students are increasing their reading ability by showing growth from fall to spring using the current year's benchmark assessments. Data was presented showing growth in reading scores in all grade levels K-5. Elementary teachers are focused on professional development that will help continue the work to improve reading ability. Phonics and handwriting will be two key areas of focus since data has shown a link between those and reading ability.

There is one more event being planned for May which will make three engagement nights for this school year.
