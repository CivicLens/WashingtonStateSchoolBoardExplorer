Concerns about locker room privacy and how similar gender issues are handled in lower grades were also raised. The board unanimously approved the first reading of Policy 3211.  Policies 3143 "District Notification of Juvenile Offenders," 3144 "Release of Information Concerning Student Sexual and Kidnapping Offenders" and 3145 "Sex Offender Access to District Property" were also introduced for their first reading. These policies, developed in collaboration with law enforcement, aim to establish a common protocol for addressing sexual offenders' access to school property. Discussions centered around the public availability of related information and the limited access granted to adult offenders who have children attending Blaine Schools. The board unanimously approved the first reading of all three policies.

## 2019-06-05 - BELLINGHAM_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS (Minutes)

The Bellingham School Board meeting minutes highlight student perspectives on diversity and inclusion. Students expressed a desire for unified sports options for younger students to be more inclusive of those questioning their gender identity. They also mentioned the lack of teacher representation reflecting their own identities, suggesting a need for greater diversity among educators.  The students felt that leadership opportunities should be made available at a younger age.  

One student noted taking an African American history class and suggested it should be required for all students. The meeting included a report from Ms. Diaz Hackler about her interactions with students at a linkage meeting, where she learned about the disconnect between the language used in "The Bellingham Promise" and the students' lived experiences.
