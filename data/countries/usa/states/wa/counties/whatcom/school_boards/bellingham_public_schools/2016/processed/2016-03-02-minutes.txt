STUDY SESSION
Discussion regarding balanced calendars
Dr. Baker welcomed the group. He described the purpose of study sessions, noting that at
the start of each school year, the directors identify a number of topics they would like to
learn more about. He stressed that tonight’s study session does not mean our district is
considering a move to a balanced calendar. The meeting is for informational purposes
only and will give the directors an opportunity to gain a broader perspective on the topic
and help answer questions, when they arise, from families and community members.
Ms. Weston presented a PowerPoint that highlighted common terminology and the types
of calendars currently in use. Mr. Gresham, Ms. Talley, Mr. McElroy and Dr. Copland
then presented pros and cons in a debate format. Summary of discussion:
Pros (Ms. Talley and Mr. Gresham):
 Some students experience a significant loss of academic skills during the long
summer break. The “summer slide” is a very real phenomenon. Because many
families do not have the resources needed to enroll their children in summer

camps, music programs, or athletic activities, their children are likely to spend
their summer months with little to do.
Teachers would benefit in terms of opportunities for professional development.
While opponents of the balanced calendar say teachers need the entire summer to
recoup; those who have experienced the balanced calendar say it gives them
more opportunities to recoup; as a result there is less absenteeism.
The start of the year is a “big” event, as is the end of the year. Also, the
timeframe between winter and spring break is a particularly long stretch for both
students and staff. A balanced calendar leads to a calmer experience for all.

Cons (Dr. Copland and Mr. McElroy):
 This is an outdoor-oriented community. Many families do not want to give up
vacation opportunities during what they consider to be the two ideal weather
months – July and August.
 Our district is part of an entire infrastructure outside of our boundaries. This
would have a significant impact on the business community that relies on high
school students for summer employment. Teachers and staff who have students
in other school districts count on reasonably aligned calendars. A calendar
different from other districts would make for significant complexities when
trying to manage childcare, parks and recreation programs, vocational
opportunities, and extracurricular activities.
 Challenges are significant in terms of addressing issues around transportation,
food service delivery and hiring.
General Discussion/Questions:
 The data on the benefits of a year-round calendar seems compelling when
low-income families and students are studied. Would a better approach be
looking for more strategies that would help our most challenged kids?
 Should we consider doing this only at the elementary level or only at one school?
We do not have many models of districts that have done this system-wide;
typically it is a single-school-only approach, or a strategy used by charter or
magnet schools.
 What models do the highest-performing countries use?
 In terms of the “summer slide,” how much time transpires before a student begins
to experience this?
Following discussion, Dr. Baker briefly summarized key points made on both sides of the issue
and expressed thanks to participants and attendees.
The meeting adjourned at 7:38 p.m.
