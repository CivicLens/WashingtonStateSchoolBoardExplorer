Principal Reports:

Mr. Henry, Principal at Goldendale High School reported that the TASK program allows teachers
to work one-on-one for twenty minutes per day with students who have a D or F grade on
record. Mr. Henry is also concerned about ninth grade students taking responsibility for being on
time to class and for their desire to earn good grades; he has created an extended lunch period
as an incentive for academic achievement. With the new “Good Standing” program requirements
this year, students are held accountable for good attendance and grades; no more than eight
days of absence are allowed. If the students have only one F grade, he/she may still attend

school events but if their grades are worse than that, they are not allowed to attend school
events. Mr. Henry noted that homecoming week activities went very well this past week with the
noise parade, a huge football win, the lighting of the “G” on the hill and a new event was
established this year where the high school homecoming Princesses have a tea party with
primary school children.
Mr. Barta, Principal at Goldendale Middle School noted that he had approximately fifteen
students attend summer school to improve their grades but he suspects these same children may
fall back once they enter ninth grade. The middle school robotics class is very full and exciting
things happening in that classroom. The middle school students have a “We Scare Hunger”
campaign during Halloween where they will trick or treat for canned goods instead of candy
which will be donated our local food bank. Mr. Barta invited everyone to attend the PTO
Dodgeball Tournament to be held at the high school gym on November 16 th.
Mr. Den Boer, Vice-Principal/Activities Director at Goldendale High School noted students on
restriction from off-campus lunch period for tardy infractions, are required to find him at least
three times during the break period to report in; students love the extended lunch period so it is
a great incentive to be to class and in their seat on time. The dress code procedures are being
followed by the majority of students. Mr. Den Boer announced that the athletic teams enjoyed
much success this week; football and volleyball teams may be going to playoffs.
Mr. Ferrell, Principal at Goldendale Primary School reported that the primary school is focusing
on the “Proactive” habit from the Seven Habits of Highly Effective Kids series; the children are
learning to be in charge of oneself. The job fair will be held this week for the micro-society
positions available each year; students apply for positions such as banker, postal worker, etc.
There is a variety of required testing conducted each year and this year, a new assessment will be
conducted at the first grade level. With the new all-day kindergarten program, additional funding
is available that is specific to remedial reading needs of the primary school students so a new
remedial reading teacher will be hired soon; other students with low test scores can be served
with this funding also. The Timberwolf News Network should be up and running in November.
Board Comments:

Ms. Heart noted that she has been asked to serve on a committee to start up a new radio station
specific for the basis of education; if the application is approved, it will open opportunities for
student career training possibly. She thanked the Board of Directors for attending the recent
Legislative dinner meeting. Mr. Conroy thanked Mr. Randall, Maintenance Director for working
so hard to keep our school facilities and grounds looking so nice.

WSSDA/Leg. Report:

Ms. Heart reminded everyone that our Legislative representatives will be visiting our school
district on November 14, 2013 at 2:00 p.m. for approximately one hour. It will provide an
opportunity to visit with Sen. Curtis King, Rep. Norm Johnson and Rep. Charles Ross.

Superintendent’s Report:

Mr. Heid reported that enrollment is currently at 942 fte and our current budget is based on 900
fte. Enrollment is up by eleven students from last month.
Mr. Heid noted that the annual WSSDA Board of Directors conference will be held in Bellevue on
November 20-23, 2013.
Mr. Heid noted that homecoming events last week went very well with students participating in
multiple activities and even though chaotic at times, the students were very well behaved and
the community seemed to enjoy the events.
Mr. Heid noted that teachers and principals are out of the building more than usual this year due
to the trainings required for the Common Core Curriculum and the Teacher Principal Evaluation
Program (TPEP).
