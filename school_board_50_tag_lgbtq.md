## 2024-08-26 - LA_CONNER_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The La Conner School Board held a regular meeting on August 26, 2024, where they appointed Emmalin Goodman and Kellie Cayou-Lockrem as Student Representatives for the 2024-2025 school year, emphasizing the importance of student autonomy in voicing their opinions and feedback. The board is looking forward to engaging the student representatives in discussions, particularly about the cell phone policy, which aims to reduce distractions and bullying, thereby enhancing mental health among students. The policy mandates that middle school students turn in their phones at the beginning of the school day, while high school students will use Yondr pouches to secure their devices. The board also discussed the upcoming Braves' Day event, designed to foster community engagement by welcoming families and providing essential information about the school year. Additionally, revisions to the fines and fees schedule were approved, including a reduction in the yearbook cost, reflecting ongoing policy changes aimed at making school more accessible for families.
