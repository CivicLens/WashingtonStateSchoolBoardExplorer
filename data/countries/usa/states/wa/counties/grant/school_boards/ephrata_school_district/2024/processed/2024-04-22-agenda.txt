e. Approve Parkway Audio Enhancement EPIC/Safe System
The IT department is seeking to hire Advanced Classroom Technologies (ACT) to replace the current intercom system with the new system
(Audio Enhancement) as slated in the approved 2022 Capital Projects Levy. This will bring the intercom system up to date in the building and in
addition, include integrated classroom sound and the SAFE system in every classroom. Currently, classrooms are using aging Redcat devices to
amplify sound for students. This system includes a set of 4 ceiling speakers that integrate directly with the Promethean and a teacher lapel
microphone. Students with special hearing needs and listening devices can connect directly to the system. The SAFE system is a call button in
each classroom that alerts the front office of an emergency. This is the same system that is installed at Columbia Ridge and Ephrata Middle
School. Ephrata High School will be the next building targeted to receive this update. Labor and parts will be secured using state purchasing
contracts and paid for with levy funds. Equipment and parts can be captured and reused in the event of any potential future remodel or
relocation plans. This will be paid with capital funds.

f. Approve Student Chromebook Purchase
The IT Department would like to order 500 Lenovo student Chromebooks with Hard Cases and 3 Year Warranties (Including Accidental Damage)
for the coming school year. These Chromebooks are part of our annual refresh to support the district learning model. The District needs to
replace approximately 20% - 25% each year to maintain the 1:1 device program for students. This purchase was quoted using the WSIPC
Purchasing Contract. See attached quote from Bluum.
