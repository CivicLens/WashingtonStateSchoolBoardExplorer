Explanation of Issue:
Attached is a resolution approving a temporary transfer of funds of up to $1,000,000from the Capital Projects Fund to the Transportation
Vehicle Fund as allowed by WAC 392-123-135. The district has placed an order for new and replacement school buses that will be delivered
by August 1, 2018, so that these buses can be brought into service at the start of the 2018-19school year. The interfund loan is necessary
because the timing of revenues doesnt match the timing of the purchases. Revenues that will fund these purchases are received in August
(state bus transportation amount)and in October and April (local tax levies), whereas the buses will be purchased by the beginning of
August. The loan will be repaid within a year of issuance, interest will be paid on the loan at the Local Government Investment Pool (LGIP)
rate that would otherwise be available to these funds, and both funds are solvent.
