Mr. Benjamin called the meeting to order at 6 p.m. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw,

Superintendent Greg Baker, and Ruth Rasmussen (recorder)
Mr. Benjamin said the board, leadership team, and staff were still grieving the Nov. 20th
deaths of Communications Director Tanya Rowe and her son Benton. Postponement of
tonight’s meeting was considered; however, it seemed appropriate to hold the meeting as
a way of honoring Tanya’s dedication and commitment to the board’s work and to
acknowledge her philosophy of pushing ahead with the work at hand, even in the face of
what sometimes seemed insurmountable obstacles.
Welcome and introduction of newly elected board member and re-elected board
members.
Dr. Smith, who is retiring from the board after eight years of service, commended the
directors, district leadership, and staff for their dedication to the district, and he
welcomed his successor, Jenn Mason, who was elected in November and will be seated
this evening following administration of the oaths of office. He said that Doug Benjamin,
who was re-elected to a four-year term in November, would also be administered the oath
of office this evening.
Swearing in of newly elected and re-elected members
Dr. Baker administered the oath of office to Ms. Mason (Director Position 4) and Mr.
Benjamin (Director Position 5). Following the swearing-in ceremony, Dr. Smith left the
meeting and Ms. Mason was seated at the directors’ table.
