Employees Appreciation Week is March 10-14, 2014 and each school will conduct a variety of
activities to show their appreciation for our staff. The high school Drama Club will provide a

project. The spring music program schedule was reviewed.
Mr. Heid review aspects of a recent bid for a new school bus. Clay West, Transportation Director
has recommended that the Blue Bird school bus be purchased even though its cost is a little
higher that the Thomas brand. Our current bus fleet are Blue Birds so it is beneficial to purchase
the same brand for maintenance purposes, parts replacement, etc. and the Blue Bird bus bid is
one year newer than the Thomas brand. This new bus will be purchased with a wheelchair lift.
