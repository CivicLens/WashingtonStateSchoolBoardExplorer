Re: 2023-2024 Fiscal Year End
____________________________________________________________________________
Attached are the final fiscal year end reports for 2023-2024.

1. All Funds
a. Commentary
b. Complete Fiscal Year End Document (F196)
Commentary:
Revenues:
Revenues for 2023-2024 totalled $63,603,321.35.
Apportionment accounted for the largest portion of revenue at $38,027,921.30.
Local levy collections (and a minute amount of timber excise tax) accounted for 16% of the revenue for the year,
with local non-tax support contributing an additional 4.8%, for a total local revenues contribution of approximately
21%.
The $260,100 listed under Other Financing Sources is for the new copy machine lease entered into in September
2023. A relatively new accounting principle requires that the entirety of the lease be booked in year one, with
offsetting long-term financing entered as revenue. This is not actual revenue.
Expenditures:
2023-2024 Expenditures total $65,367,047.90.
Actual expenditures during the course of the 23-24 fiscal year were $64,951,899.49.
An additional $260,100 of the total expenses are for the new copier lease mentioned above and do not reflect the
actual amount paid on the lease for the year. This lease should have been booked at the beginning of the
agreement in September.
$389,148.41 are adjustments for overstatement of revenues and inventory for previous fiscal years.
The net result is that the district has overspent its approved appropriations for the fiscal year by $598,243.90 and
is required to submit an explanatory statement to OSPI.

Fund Balance:
As of August 31, 2024, the ending fund balance in the General Fund is $3,725,244.40. This is significantly lower than what was
reported on the preliminary Budget Status in September due to the adjustments in the districts asset general ledger accounts. As
a percent of the actual expenditures for the fiscal year, this is a 5.7% fund balance.

Re: Capital Projects, Facilities, and Operations Report - November 2024
______________________________________________________________________
Small Works Capital Projects
Capital staff are working with the City of Bainbridge Island Public Works Department to prepare bid documents for the
Woodward Middle School Solar Installation Project. Staff are coordinating with Woodward staff and the CTE Department
to develop student learning and participation opportunities as a part of the project.

DA Hogan and Associates are working with Capital staff to finalize a permit package for the installation of a field lighting
system for both the multipurpose and synthetic turf fields at Woodward Middle School. The project has been reorganized
into three potential phases with the first phase of installing synthetic turf within the track already having been completed.
Hargis Electrical Engineers are preparing to conduct a district-wide lighting upgrade design that will incorporate a holistic
transition to LED lighting. Initial calculations would suggest an overall reduction in power consumption of eight to twelve
percent or $85,000 per year in utility savings. Included in the project is an inventory of all lighting fixtures, bulbs, and
lighting control systems. Capital staff anticipates obtaining substantial incentives from Puget Sound Energy if the potential
project is conducted.
Capital staff are maintaining consistent communication with staff from the City of Bainbridge Island and their contractors
to minimize disruption to the Ordway, Commodore, and BHS communities during the Madison Ave improvement project.
The BIMPRD is working with Facilities staff to minimize disruption and expedite essential renovations taking place at the
Ray Williamson Memorial Pool.
Transportation
Three driver trainees are on schedule to complete their training and test for their CDLs by the end of November.
The annual Student Transportation Allocation Report (STARS) is complete and student ridership is currently set at 2113
for
Maintenance and Operations

Maintenance and Facilities staff are preparing plans for surplus disposal and large-scale recycling efforts during winter
break.
Maintenance staff are preparing to address the BHS 100 aluminum exterior doors by refitting them with surface-mounted
hinges to address sagging and hinge fatigue from over-extension.
Grounds and Maintenance staff are conducting regular fall maintenance at all building sites including roof cleaning and
system winterization.
Staff are scheduled to begin inventorying and performing annual maintenance on all portable equipment during the winter
months.
Facilities
Facility Rental Revenue for October is $15,283.00, a 133% increase over last year's October revenue of $6,532.53. This
