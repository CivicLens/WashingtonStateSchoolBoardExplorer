4. District Reports
A. ASB Report
Tristan Rennaker, ASB Treasurer, reported on the Adopt a Freshie program, planning a winter formal dance, and future projects
and goals. Board Director Paulson asked how the student body felt in regards to the homecoming football game being canceled
by the visiting team. Tristan and Lila felt everything went very and the student body was able to participate in the alternative
activities that took place in place of the football game. There were still fireworks, homecoming court and the other events that
were planned for the evening which created a fun atmosphere and possibly more student involvement than just the football team
in the end. Going forward and event like this may be planned in the future (on a bye week) since it turned out to have great
participation and enthusiasm by the students, parents and community. The game will be rescheduled.
B. Student Representative's Report
Student representative Lila Hutchens reported on a few of the projects leadership class members have been working on, events
during homecoming week and seniors meeting with the Josten's representative on October 9th. Seniors are looking at color and
design choices for the Class of 2025. Lila reported the sophomores and seniors tied for first place in the spirit week competitions.
There was "tons" of student involvement and everyone had fun! Participation is still up in the cheering section at the volleyball
games. Lila also reported on M. Tupling's project of putting together a monthly newsletter and the assembly with a guest speaker
whose message was resiliency.
C. Athletic Director's Report
Athletic director Sam Korslund reported on the fall sports season and winter sports registration numbers. Middle school boys
basketball will begin practice on Monday, October 28th. High school basketball and wrestling practice will begin on November
18th. Middle school 8th grade boys will have the option to play up on high school teams once their season is over. Middle school
8th grade girls will have the option of starting the season with the HS girls team since their season doesn't begin until after the
first of the year. Director Paulson, and the other board members, commended Sam on his hard work in getting the transition
from getting the news of the game being cancelled to getting the alternative activities set up and communicated to the students,
staff and community.

D. K-12 Principal Report
K-12 principal Amy Cox reported on upcoming parent teacher conferences district wide, Title 1 family engagement night on
Monday, October 21st, the book fair and PTSO carnival and homecoming week. Mrs. Cox commended Jamie Trump for all of her
hard work during the week along with students and staff who pitched in to make the week a lot of fun. The STEAM club is getting
underway. Horizon and Elevate are sponsoring a STEAM club for middle school students after school two days a week. Amber
Olson and Allica Stapleton will be the staff in charge of the club. It will be Tuesdays and Thursdays after school for 90 minutes.
Public transportation will be able to take students home at no charge however space is limited to 30 students; Parents are
encouraged to make arrangements as soon as possible. The Washington State Art Commission continues to have art displayed in
the elementary and high school building as part of an art appreciation outreach. The Tri-State Steelheaders have restocked the
two salmon tanks in the elementary building with approximately 500 eggs. They will come in monthly to teach lessons to
elementary students. FFA members will be traveling to Indianapolis next week for the national convention.
E. Superintendent's Report
Superintendent Wheatley reported on our early release Wednesdays this year which will focus on teacher effectiveness.
Facilitators from the ESD 123 will lead the sessions this year. Mr. Wheatley updated the board on the decision to not move
forward with the middle school open science curriculum Mr. Reser was looking into last year. The curriculum did not turn out to
be a good fit in our middle school science program. The upside is possibly redesigning the curriculum to be CTE funded which
would be a benefit to students and open up another pathway for CTE classes. Superintendent Wheatley was invited to speak at
the candidates forum hosted by the local chapter of AAU in regards to the good things happening in the school district. The scan
for the gym roof has been completed and we are now waiting for the results. At this time we do not know how many layers of
the gym roof will need to be replaced. The best scenario would be to repair the topmost layer which would free up funds for
other projects.
F. Budget Status Report
Business manager Jana Eaton reported on the September budget status and the changes to the report for this year to encumber
funds dedicated for payroll and monthly scheduled expenditures. Mrs. Eaton is working on the F-196 which is the financial
reporting summary containing all of the revenue and expenditures for the 2023-2024 school year. The comprehensive report
pulls in information for all of our funds and gives a detailed picture of the financial health of the district. Other reports due in the
next several months are the S-275 which looks at staffing for the district and the SEFA which looks at Federal expenditures for
the previous school year.
