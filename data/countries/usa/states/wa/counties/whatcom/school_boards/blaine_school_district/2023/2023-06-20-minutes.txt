  4. Reports
A. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter shared a final report on enrollment for the 2022-2023 school year. The enrollment count for June was 8.28 FTE below May, with the decrease concentrated in upper grade levels. These figures will be considered in the budgeted enrollment level for the 2023-2024 school year.
  B. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter reported that revenue and expenses for the month of May were typical. The spring tax collection is mostly complete, and the state's apportionment was a bit low. The General Fund's revenue was lower than expenses in May. Ms. Porter commented on the difficulty of comparing this year to the prior unusual years. She also indicated that the district may not receive 100% of this year's budgeted revenue due to GASB requirements.

Director Creydt asked for clarification regarding the sources of district revenue and what the General Fund's balance would be if 100% of revenue was collected. Discussion continued, and Ms. Porter asked that Director Creydt email her specific questions in order to provide exact figures.

Director Leu commended Ms. Porter and apologized for comments he made at a prior meeting that had been used to assert that the district's fund balance would continue to grow. He acknowledged that Ms. Porter had been correct at that prior meeting when she predicted that the General Fund balance would decrease over time.
  C. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
He thanked Directors Akre and Leu for representing the board at Blaine High School's graduation.
A tentative agreement has been reached with SEIU which is scheduled for member ratification on August 28. Depending upon the timing of ratification, the board's acceptance of the SEIU agreement will either be considered at the regular meeting on August 28 or at a special meeting early in the morning on August 29. Negotiations are still pending with BEA, and two days of bargaining are calendared for early August. Director Gibson noted that three of the district's four labor contracts are now completed.
From June 26 through August 4, the District Office will operate on a summer schedule. Office hours will be Monday through Thursday from 7:00 a.m. through 5:30 p.m. and the District Office will be closed on Fridays. The District Office will also be closed for deep cleaning during the week of July 10.
Upgrades to the high school's construction shop have now been completed so that a welding program can be offered. Dean Berkeley expressed his appreciation and indicated that his donation of welding equipment will be delivered.

  6. Action Items
A. Approval of Superintendent's Contract
President Thomas provided explanation on the contract which includes language similar to the prior superintendent's contract. Dr. Granger's salary was compared to similar-sized districts in the region and is within an average of those districts. President Thomas thanked Dr. Granger for his willingness to accept a 3.2% salary increase which is below the state's IPD rate and less than the increase being given to other staff groups.

Director Creydt asked for clarification about the language referencing retroactive pay. Director Leu explained that the adjustment can be made after re-evaluation of the the comparative district salaries.
  Director Leu further commented on misinformation in the community about Dr. Granger's salary. Director Leu stated publicly that, by his calculations, Dr. Granger's salary increase this year is less than 1% and Dr. Granger's salary increases over the past three years have been less than the increases given to teachers in that same time period. Director Leu believes that Blaine School District is fortunate to have someone of Dr. Granger's credentials in leadership and he believes that Dr. Granger is underpaid. Director Creydt questioned Director Leu's calculations.
  President Thomas added his observation, since his time on the board, that Dr. Granger has consistently taken less in salary increases than other staff groups have received.

The board voted to approve the Superintendent's Contract through June 2026. President Thomas declared the 4-1 vote. Director Creydt asked that her "nay" vote be recorded correctly. President Thomas confirmed that Director Creydt voted "nay".
Motion by Don Leu, second by Charles E Gibson

Nay: Erika Creydt
