BOARD OF DIRECTORS
April 20, 2017
OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location
April 20, 2017 – 1306 Dupont St., Bellingham, Washington
Call to Order/Roll Call
Board President Douglas Benjamin called the meeting to order at 6:15 p.m. Present:
Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler, Quenby Peterson,
Steven Smith, Superintendent Greg Baker, and recorder Ruth Rasmussen.
Audience: Kathy Hasenjaeger said it is important for students to be fully aware of the
degree of flexibility they have in high school course selection. She asked that the board
not promote a culture, either through establishment of policies or other means, that would
cause students to prioritize Advanced Placement (AP) classes over other classes that are
equally or potentially more beneficial.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
 Directors’ questions: Dr. Baker said earlier this week, he answered several board
members’ questions relating to this week’s agenda. These were submitted in a timely
manner, he said, and helped clarify or correct various items on the agenda.
 Start/End Times Adjustments: The administrative team is continuing to disseminate
information and address families’ questions, particularly regarding changes in bus
schedules.
 2017-18 Budget: The district will soon be publicizing and seeking feedback on
budget priorities for the coming school year. The legislature has not finalized the state
budget, so school districts do not know what to expect in terms of state revenues for
next year’s budget.
 McCleary Presentation: On May 3, Tom Ahearne, the lead attorney in the McCleary
v. State of Washington legal case, will speak at Bellingham High School about the
history, outcomes, and future of the McCleary case.
 Facilities Planning Task Force: The group’s first meeting was held today, April 20.
Membership is diverse and includes parents, district staff, administrators, community
members and City of Bellingham representatives.
CONSENT ITEMS: Prior to approval of the consent agenda, the board briefly discussed
the wording in Item A, Operating Policy 1610 – Conflicts of Interest in 1st Class
Districts. Dr. Smith then made a motion, seconded by Ms. Bashaw, to approve the
consent agenda items. Vote was unanimous.

Ms. Diaz Hackler said per RCW 42.23.030, she would recuse herself from voting on
consent item 2.3, Approval of Expenditures and Payroll – March 2017, because the item
includes an invoice for $688.67 from Construction Supply Company, Inc., where her
husband is employed.
