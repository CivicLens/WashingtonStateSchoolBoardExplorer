  Special Board Meeting
Monday, January 13, 2020
  1. Special Board Meeting
A. Call to Order
President Gibson called the meeting to order at 5:00pm. Directors Thomas, Lotze, Gibson, and McKinney were in attendance at the beginning of the meeting. Director Nunamaker arrived at 5:15pm.
  2. Action Items
A. Policy 3211 Gender-Inclusive Schools: First Reading
Dr. Christopher Granger, Superintendent, explained that Senate Bill (SB) 5689 requires the district to adopt this policy prior to January 31, 2020. In order to meet this deadline, the board was asked to approve first reading at this meeting so that second reading and adoption could be considered at the regular meeting on January 27. Dr. Granger commended the school administrators who have been doing a great job in meeting the needs of students as issues arise in this area.
  Director McKinney brought up areas of concern for discussion. It was agreed that two sentences will be stricken from the updated procedural language in reference to communication with parents. Removal of the commentary in those sentences would not change the nature of how student issues will be handled. Locker room privacy was also discussed. Director Lotze inquired about how similar gender issues are handled in the lower grades. Director Thomas asked how this issue is communicated to other student peers. Dr. Granger commented that this matter addresses a very small population of students, and each situation is handled differently according to the individual needs of the student. He reiterated that school administrators make every effort to meet student needs in this area as they arise.
  The board approved "First Reading" of Policy 3211 Gender-Inclusive Schools.

  B. Policy 3143 District Notification of Juvenile Offenders: First Reading
Dr. Granger described the request from law enforcement for county-wide adoption of a common protocol for addressing sexual offenders' access to school property. Policies 3143, 3144, and 3145 address the rights of offenders who have a legitimate need for access to schools. Policies 3143 and 3144 address matters related to juvenile offenders, and WSSDA has provided the language in these policies. Policy 3145 addresses the rights of adult offenders, in particular those who have children in attendance at Blaine Schools. WSSDA does not have a model policy addressing school access for adult offenders. The language in Policy 3145 was drafted for another district by the same law firm that Blaine would have retained for this purpose. This policy provides direction on how to handle these situations and sets the precedent for allowing adult offenders to have limited access to campus facilities. Dr. Granger applauded law enforcement for taking a proactive initiative in implementing these protocols and for communicating with impacted offenders so that they are aware of this change in access to Whatcom County schools. Director McKinney asked how much of the related information is public and discussion followed. Dr. Larry Francois, Superintendent of NWESD 189, added that student offender information is only provided to those adults on campus who need to know.
