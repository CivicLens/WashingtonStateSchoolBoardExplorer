## 2022-02-10 - LYNDEN_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Lynden School Board meeting minutes reveal significant community tension regarding COVID-19 policies and curriculum content. Parents voiced concerns about mask mandates, vaccination requirements, and the presence of books they deemed inappropriate in school libraries. Some parents explicitly requested the removal of "obscene pornography" and materials related to Critical Race Theory.  

The meeting also included a discussion on potential policy changes driven by parental feedback. A parent threatened legal action against the school district unless they ceased COVID-19 related policies, including mask mandates and vaccination promotion. The board reviewed a draft letter to state legislators expressing concerns about the challenges posed by pandemic mandates. 


Further, the minutes document requests from students for greater autonomy regarding mask-wearing and highlight concerns about the impact of masks on breathing.  The meeting also included discussion about lunch times and recess rules at elementary schools and Lynden Middle School (LMS).
