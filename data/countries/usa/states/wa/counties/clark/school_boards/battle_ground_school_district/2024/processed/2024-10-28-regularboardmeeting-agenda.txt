Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors approves the Print Shop
equipment lease with Konica Minolta.

Public Content
Background:
The districts current 60 month operating lease with Pacific Office Automation for the two Print Shop black and white production printers
expires December 31, 2024.
In lieu of conducting a formal bid to replace the print shop equipment, the District Purchasing Agent elected to use a competitively bid
cooperative contract. Although not required when using cooperative contracts, multiple options were considered. Interested vendors were
provided a list of approved cooperatives and District specifications and invited to submit a proposal, using the cooperative contract of their
choosing.
Incumbent Pacific Office Automation, Ricoh, CTX/Xerox, and Konica Minolta Business Services submitted proposals. Konica Minolta
Business Services offered the most favorable pricing and service references. Konica Minolta is the recommended vendor. Leasing will be
provided through KMPF Premier Financing.

The expiring monthly lease amount is $2,684.84. The proposed new lease will replace both of the 6136 Accurio Press production printers
with two current model Accurio Press 7136 Production Printers at a cost of $2,202.92 per month for 60 months which includes $140 monthly
maintenance fees for the booklet maker component of each production line. Net savings over the current lease is $481.92 per month, or
$28,915 over the lease term. Tax is not included in the lease amounts.
Maintenance support is a separate and additional charge, billed quarterly, at a click rate of .003 per page printed. The single click charge
applies to all sizes up to and including 13x19. This is the same rate we currently pay.
Maintenance service contracts include all parts, labor, preventative maintenance, toner and staples. Click rates and monthly equipment
pricing is locked for the duration of the lease term. Digital Storefront software support (licensing/upgrades/security patches) is anticipated to
be $400 per month. This is the same rate we currently pay.
Installation will take place over winter break. Lease will commence January 1, 2025.
Terms of thecontract are governed by the Sourcewell cooperative contract 030321-KON. This was a competitive procurement that meets
Washington's RCW 39.26. The district has an interlocal agreement with Sourcewell to access the contract to receive discounted pricing from
Konica Minolta.

The Board of Directors approve the Amergis Healthcare
Staffing contract amendment for the 2024-25 school year.

Background:
Amergis Healthcare Staffing (formerly Maxim Healthcare Staffing Services) has been providing temporary district healthcare and special
education teaching staff.
Our district has had difficulty directly hiring for these positions due to staffing shortages and the inability to find qualified candidates. The
contracted staffing Amergis provides would normally be district employees. Weve reached out to several contractors and this vendor was
able to meet our needs in a timely manner. Lowest cost was not a factor in our decision because costs are comparable between staffing
agencies.
This contract is for district wide healthcare and special education staffing services for unfilled positions for the 2024-25 school year. The
original contract was approved for $600,0000 on 8/12/2024. Since then, these departments were in need of additional staff. Therefore, the
estimated costs will exceed the current contract total by $100,000 for a total of $700,000 for the 2024-25 school year.
