A. Public Comment
The following individuals addressed the board regarding topics of concern:
Hugo Vekved, a student basketball athlete, asked the board, with assistance from his mother, to give him a special exemption from the COVID testing requirement for unvaccinated athletes. President Gibson reminded the audience that the board does not engage in dialogue during the public comment period, and he expressed appreciation for Hugo's courage in speaking up for himself. 
Jerry Vekved, Hugo's father, described the details of their family's experience with registering Hugo for the basketball season, which included miscommunication regarding the testing requirement. Mr. Vekved voiced his objection to the testing requirement and described it as a punishment for not being vaccinated. He suggested alternate methods for verifying that Hugo does not have COVID. 
Kristin Engen again addressed the board in support of administrators and staff who do not want to get the COVID vaccine. She displayed a large picture of her nephew being tested at basketball practice and described what she saw as administrators who appeared uncertain what they should be doing while the team sat without playing. Ms. Engen expressed disagreement with separating students based upon "shot status". She also voiced her objection to the district providing a vaccine clinic for families.

Changes in the community over the coming decade will be addressed when this process is repeated following the 2030 US Census. The board voted unanimously to adopt the second draft of the district's redistricting plan with changes to the director district boundaries for Blaine School District.

This contract was not placed on the Consent Agenda because Director Thomas must abstain from voting since his wife is a Blaine teacher.

Director Creydt asked about following up on the comments made earlier in the meeting and discussion followed.

President Thomas encouraged any directors with questions about the agenda to reach out to him or to Dr. Granger ahead of the meeting. Director Gibson explained that the board does not get involved with the district's day-to-day operations. That is the responsibility of the superintendent and other administrators.
