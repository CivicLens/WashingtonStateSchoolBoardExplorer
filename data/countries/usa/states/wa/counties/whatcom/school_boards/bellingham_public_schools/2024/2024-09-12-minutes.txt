Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder). Director Doug
Benjamin (President) was unable to attend the meeting.
Audience:
• Yeye Ugas, a member of Whatcom Care, would like the district to gather data about
the use of the Since Time Immemorial curriculum in every classroom. She also
requested better tracking of bias and hate incidents within the district, and she noted a
lack of BIPOC teachers in classrooms.

discrimination and harassment policies that are on the board’s consent agenda.
• Marni Saling Mayer shared concerns related to the district’s compliance with Title

experiences that would be helped if students had textbooks, rather than only access to
electronic resources.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• The new school year has started, and we welcomed nearly 11,000 students, families
and staff back to our schools.
• Highlights from the past few weeks include:
o The fourth annual block party, with over 500 families participating. Each of
our 22 schools, as well as district programs, hosted a table staffed by
principals and other school and district staff. Social service partners from the
community also participated. There was a food truck and student volunteers
who helped with translation.
o The all-staff kickoff at Bellingham High School.
o The first day for students in grades 1-12 was Sept. 29, with kindergarten and
preschool starting after the Labor Day weekend.

o The early learning center at the District Office opened, which will serve
children of parents who work within the district and students who are
recruited because of the ECEAP (Early Childhood Education and Assistance
Program) grant received from the state.
Dr. Baker has forwarded information that demonstrates that the budget issues districts
in the state are experiencing are also present across the country. The state
superintendent will submit his budget proposal to the governor and legislature in the
next few weeks. The outcome of upcoming elections may change what OSPI
recommends.
The district continues to work with the City of Bellingham to determine if there is
another site within the Civic Complex that is a better fit for Carl Cozier Elementary
School. The city will be engaging the community in investigating what the future
Civic complex could look like. In the meantime, there was new playground
equipment installed at Carl Cozier, which has been well received.
The four new classrooms at Kulshan Middle School have opened, and the new field
there is scheduled to be open next week.
As a result of each comprehensive high school now having six tennis courts, the
United States Tennis Association (USTA) will rent all 18 courts for a three-day event
next summer.
Dr. Baker shared a map of the property that the district is considering purchasing near
Bellingham and Options High Schools.
Open houses have been occurring at schools over the past week, with some still to
come.
The annual College Fair will be hosted at Squalicum High School on Oct. 10.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
GP-7.2 2024-25 Annual Board Agenda, Revised – general review.
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Mr. Ritchey has heard that the block party went well. He attended the staff kickoff,
which was incredibly impactful. He’s been happy to see students enjoying the new
playground equipment as he drives by Carl Cozier each day. He’s enthusiastic about
the state grant for the electric vehicle charging stations.
• Ms. Rose was disappointed to miss the block party and staff kickoff. She attended the
open house at Bellingham High School and was impressed by how smoothly it went.
She liked hearing that the robotics class is mostly student led.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler attended the staff kickoff and a back-to-school event at her
grandchild’s school. She has been participating in Zoom calls hosted by WSSDA in
advance of the upcoming General Assembly, which she will be attending. She had
hoped the General Assembly would be entirely in person this year, but it will be a
hybrid event again.
• Ms. Mason shared that she enjoys seeing the pride and enthusiasm at the staff kickoff
each year, and the photos of district events are great. She was at Options High School
when state representative Alicia Rule visited and toured the student health center.
Options students seem excited about the new resource.
