certification by such auditing officer that the materials have been furnished, the services rendered, and that the claim is
a just, due and unpaid obligation. Warrants shall be approved by a recorded affirmative vote of a majority of the
board."

In accordance with state requirements, our districts Title I Parent and Family Engagement policy (Board

Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA) Model policy and customized with districtspecific language, significantly expands on the original framework to enhance parent and family
engagement across all Title I schools in our district.

remove references to therapy and emotional support animals, which are not guaranteed access to school
buildings and facilities by the ADA. All requests for service animals are made through the building
principal in consultation with the Section 504 Coordinator for the district. Service animals must be trained
to do work for a person with a disability and the task or work they perform must be specific to the

disability. References to Animals as Part of the Instructional Program have been removed and will be
included in a new policy in the future, which will be based on the WSSDA policy.

Public Content
Information:Approval authorization to use the GC/CM Project Delivery Method for the New Middle
School Project, located at the Former Alderwood Middle school site to accommodate the move of 6th
Grade to Middle School. Through project checklist procedures, the Capital Projects Office (CPO) has
determined the General Contractor/Construction Manager procurement method to build the new Middle
School.
Background:During the development of the 2024 Construction Bond proposal and in subsequent
discussions, the Board of Directors indicated an interest in continuing the use of the GC/CM Project
Delivery Method, where appropriate, based on the district's use of and success with GC/CM on previous
projects.
Per RCW 39.10, school districts must obtain permission from the States Project Review Committee
(PRC) to use GC/CM. The statute also allows School Districts to apply either on a project basis or for
Agency Certification. Agency Certification authorizes a District the choice to use the GC/CM alternative
delivery method on projects that meet the criteria specified in RCW 39.10.340 for a three-year period.
The Project Review Committee granted the Edmonds School District a three-year Agency Recertification
on May 26, 2023. As part of the Districts application for Agency recertification, we committed to
formalizing the School Board approval of GC/CM for each project.
The selection of Architects and Contractors for this project will begin during the summer of 2024.
Approval of this agenda item would advance the New Middle School Project, and allow CPO to move
forward with the GC/CM selection.

Public Content
Information:
Mountlake Terrace High School HVAC Replacement Project
Background:
The selection of Hermanson Company as the Progressive Design Builder for the MTH HVAC
Replacement Project was approved by the board on its December 12, 2023 regular business meeting.
If The Board of Directors authorizes award of the contract for this matter, the District would execute the
attached agreement and issue a purchase order in the amount of $2,791,972 for GMP 1 construction
services. (See attached Hermanson Company Proposal.)
Scope of work for GMP 1 Includes replacement of existing Hot Water Boilers, Domestic Hot water tanks,
Fire alarm System, DDC Control systems and preparation for HVAC and Chiller. Work scope identified in
GMP 1 will be completed by the end of summer 2024.
The proposal considers preparation for work to be completed as part of a future GMP 2 which will consist
of air side HVAC replacement, and addition of chillers to be completed by the end of summer 2025. This
item will be presented at a future board meeting. Work delivered as part of GMP 1 will result in a
complete heating system regardless of the results of future GMP amendments.
The Districts Capital Projects Office requests total budget authorization of $14,900,000 and includes
sales tax. This total budget authorization is intended to cover all costs related to both construction phases.
Capital Projects will contract for all necessary project-related construction, FF&E (furniture, fixtures and
equipment), design, construction administration, permits, special inspections and testing, project
management, and other related services needed for the project (whether by bidding or some other
procurement procedures authorized by Washington State Law) and enter into (and, as necessary,
amend) all project-related contracts within the approved Budget Authorization, all of which will be done in
compliance with Washington State law.
Absent unforeseen conditions or District requested scope changes, the GMP Amendment sets a ceiling
for the construction cost of phase 1. If the actual Cost of the Work plus fee totals less than the amount
covered by the GMP, the agreement provides that savings be returned to the School District.
