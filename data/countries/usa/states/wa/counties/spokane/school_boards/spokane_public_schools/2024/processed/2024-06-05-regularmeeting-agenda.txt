Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation:

Approval ofexpenditures in the estimated amountof $181,025. for the College Board College Readiness
and Success System for SAT and PSAT Exams for the 2024-2025 school year.
Background:

The SAT Suite of Assessments (PSAT/NMSQT and SAT) provides a clear and structured
pathway to college readiness, helping students gauge their academic strengths and areas for
improvement. These assessments offer valuable insights that guide students in their preparation
for college and career readiness. Additionally, the SAT Suite helps schools identify and address
educational gaps, ensuring all students have equal opportunities for academic achievement.
Spokane Public Schools remains committed to offering and paying for the PSAT and SAT to 11th grade
students to ensure they practice the test and obtain an official score to report to any future four-year
colleges of interest. The district goal of having every student pursue their T-2-4 goal means equitably
ensuring that as many doors are open for students as possible even if they change their post-secondary
goal in the future.
Expenditures to be paid for out of the district general fund.

E. Amendment to PRIDE Prep Public Charter School
Renewal Application

Meeting :

Category :

6. CONSENT AGENDA

Type :

Public Content
Recommendation:

Approval of the May 7, 2024, amendment to the PRIDE Prep Public Charter School (PRIDE Prep) Renewal Application, and
reaffirmation of the School Boards prior authorization of a Charter School contract with PRIDE Prep for a five-year term, effective
July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2029.
Background:
On October 6, 2023, PRIDE Prep submitted a Charter School renewal application for the continuation of a middle school and
high school program. On February 21, 2024, the School Board approved the renewal based on the application and site
observations/interviews.
This spring, the PRIDE Prep leadership shared that middle school enrollment has continued to decline, making the middle school
program unsustainable. Attached is an amendment to PRIDE Preps renewal application, modifying the grade levels to serve high
school only (grades 9-12).
The district team has reviewed the request and supports the change in program. PRIDE Prep leadership has communicated that
they may request to reinstate the middle school programs in the future. District staff have communicated that PRIDE Prep can
request to reinstate the middle school program during the next renewal cycle.
