all the new teachers to the district and thanked

Dr. Steedman

happy retirement. She

for his preparation of the budget.

Director Bolton shared that she takes offense that the board has no integrity. She doesn’t plan to resign and always
put students

first and

protect staff.

She

also welcomed

new

teachers

and

educators.

Director Hurley shared that students should always be front and center and that is what came through
for an interim as well as the need for healing. He is excited about all the new educators.

in interviews

He also took offense to his

integrity being called out. He also said that he needs to explore the conversation with the Pickleball Coalition further
and if any promises were made.
President Rotter explained part of why public comment

was changed was to the end of the meeting was because of

people not staying around for rest of meeting. The board is constantly discussing the right thing to do. She also noted
that none of those that made

public comment stayed once again. She said that she takes her code of ethic very

seriously and has been elected three times by the majority of voters which shows belief that she has the best interest
of students in mind. She reminded

everyone that although they are individual elected officials they do not get to act

as individuals. They have to make decisions as a board. She finds it disappointing that those coming to comment
have never been

now

here before in her 11 years. She also addressed the irony that they participated in Strategic Planning

and they discussed values that they claim to be committed to yet the model

behavior counter to that of the portrait of

graduate and values. They are operating legally and ethically and when they can they will share info. She also
expressed

significant concerns about the promises made to the pickle ball coalition.

A Superintendent cannot

unilaterally make agreements with organizations or people. The board has to be involved in decision making of use of
funds.
