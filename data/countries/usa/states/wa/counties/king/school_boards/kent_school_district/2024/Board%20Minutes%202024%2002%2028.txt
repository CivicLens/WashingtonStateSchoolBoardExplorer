Subject: Checkin in
Hello Board, Superintendent, and Naomi,
I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the unfortunate news that I am not a part of the collective group as
directors. This came as a shock, as the sentiments were expressed as the board being a collaborative collective
of 5. However, as stated by Director Clark, the "3" on this side of the aisle, did not include myself or director
cook. It's unfortunate that I had to learn about this division within our team during a public meeting, but
understand that the 3 other directors, excluding myself and director cook, are comfortable with creating division
and subgroups when we should be working as a collective of 5.
With this information, I will be operating in the best interest of the students, families, communities, and KSD
affiliates. My methods may not be in alignment with the other side of the aisle, as stated on record, so I
presume that means I must engage in more independent work than anticipated, within the guidelines and
policies of my rights, privilege, and responsibilities. This is just a notice for transparency, which is the least I can
do since Director Clark was honorable enough to be transparent with me during our last session.

Subject: RE: Checkin in
Andy, I apologize for the way I stated myself on Wednesday night. What I was trying to say was the veterans on
the board have been dealing with the issue of the budget deficit for some time. Because I have been through
this before, I am well aware of the need for the superintendent to begin discussions about what a reorganization
of a large school district with all its needs would look like. It was no surprise that the early steps had to begin in
this process. What the resolution specifically stated was a very specific group is being reviewed and we are
empowering the superintendent to lay out a picture for all employees to see that definite steps have to be
taken. You are a full member of the board and I want to work with you. Please be open to further discussions as
we jointly work through this painful process which will continue until there is some new revenue to be
discovered. Tim
