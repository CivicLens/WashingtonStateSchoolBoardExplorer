Call to Order/Roll Call
Ms. Bashaw called the meeting to order at 6:17 p.m.
Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw (President), Doug Benjamin, Camille Hackler, Superintendent Greg Baker,
and recorder Lindsay Ahrens.
Audience
No audience members presented
Superintendent’s announcements and report - Dr. Baker updated the board on the following:

Hiring – The new principal at Squalicum High School is James Everett. Over the next few weeks,
leaders will be announced for Northern Heights, Lowell, Shuksan, and Sehome.

Budget – The budget springboard was presented to staff and families. The survey closed yesterday and
the results will help us adjust and influence our thinking on the budget. Amongst the responses were
appreciation for the process, people resonating with the stated priorities, and others advocating for certain
areas. We’ll take the summary of responses with other feedback and incorporate it into our process as the state
legislature completes its work.
As a part of the process to influence legislators in regards to budget, the Bellingham Educators’
Association just informed us that they have voted to walk out on Friday, April 27. Around the state, various
labor groups are taking different approaches. Since this is an unanticipated absence, teachers will not be paid
for Friday and we will make up the missed day. There are some questions about athletics and activities that
day, students who attend programs in other districts, and a host of other questions that we have to work
through. The BEA indicated they are not protesting this district, but focusing their energy towards Olympia.
The district is taking a neutral position. We support education funding, but reserve judgment about the tactic.
