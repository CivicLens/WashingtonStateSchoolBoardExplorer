REGULAR AGENDA ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports
Dr. Steve Smith participated in the Board’s community linkage meeting on November 3, 2011
with members of the business community. The time was well spent and he came away with
several thoughts about the skill set the business community seeks from our graduates. He also
participated in the monthly Board visit to Geneva Elementary School. During the visit, the
school shared information about Response to Intervention (RtI) and full-time kindergarten.
Dr. Ken Gass also participated in the linkage on November 3 and learned of the traits that are
valuable to the business community. Dr. Gass visited Geneva Elementary School and enjoyed
learning about the kindergarten literacy program. Director Gass also visited Silver Beach
Elementary School for the Veterans Day assembly and met with Curriculum Director Jim
Facciano.
Kelly Bashaw participated in the linkage with the business community and later discussed some
of the comments with Director Smith to consider what the next steps should be for the Board.
Ms. Bashaw enjoyed the Board’s visit to Geneva Elementary and being part of their upbeat
positive energy.
Ann Whitmyer met with Dr. Baker to discuss Board transition. Ms. Whitmyer was impressed
with the comments received during the business linkage and the importance of our graduates
being good communicators. She participated in the Board visit to Geneva Elementary and
attended the November 8 Cordata Neighborhood Association meeting at which Dr. Baker and
Meridian School District Superintendent Tim Yeomans spoke. The Association members
expressed appreciation for having a school in their neighborhood with a full-size gym. Ms.
Whitmyer also visited Shuksan Middle School for their “Turning to One Another” event, which
is focused on telling the story of the school.
President Whitmyer covered several Board “housekeeping” items concerning the upcoming
Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA) Annual Conference. Ken Gass moved

Superintendent’s Announcements and Report
Superintendent Greg Baker introduced several guests.
Three members of Cordata Elementary School’s Watch D.O.G.S. (Dads of Great Students), were
in attendance. The school’s PTA co-president Scott McAuley launched Watch D.O.G.S., a
program to encourage positive male role models for students in classrooms and hallways. By
their presence, the dads demonstrate the importance of education and provide extra eyes and ears
to enhance school safety and promote a positive climate.
The College Board named the district one of 367 public school districts in the nation with a place
on the 2011–12 AP Honor Roll for simultaneously increasing students’ access to Advanced
Placement (AP) coursework while maintaining rigor or increasing the percentage of students
earning scores of 3 or higher on AP exams. Dr. Baker introduced Squalicum High School
Principal Keith Schacht who explained the importance of students taking AP classes, which are
open to all students. Mr. Schacht reported that for 2011–12, the pass rate for AP students at
Squalicum High School is 66.3% while the global pass rate is 60.2% (students must receive a 3
or better for passage). Mr. Schacht introduced three seniors from Squalicum High School—
Santana Diaz, Dalesmy Gonzalez, and Bahara Naimzadeh—who shared their experiences taking
AP courses.
Dr. Baker updated the Board on the progress of the Levy Task Force. After the Task Force
makes its recommendation to him on both the expiring Maintenance and Operations Levy and
the expiring Technology Levy, Dr. Baker will finalize his decision and present a resolution for
the Board’s consideration at the December 8, 2011 School Board meeting.
In addition, district staff have been engaged in space planning for the District Office to make the
building work more efficiently and effectively. Consideration is being given to how our
“customers” use the building and access various departments.

identified supporting criteria. Mr. Venable introduced members of the Teaching and Learning
staff and indicated the department had spent time reviewing the various components of Ends 2.1
to determine and interpret their meaning. Mr. Venable responded to questions from the Board
and introduced Brian Rick, who explained supporting data.
Mr. Venable indicated preparing this report was helpful to the department but it is only one
indicator of student success. There are many things happening at schools that cannot be
measured and reflected in this data.

work on behalf of students.
