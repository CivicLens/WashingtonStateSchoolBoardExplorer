Public Content
In March 2019, the State of Washington filed a lawsuit against the three largest distributors of
prescription opioids in Washington state, arguing that they failed to alert law enforcement of
suspicious opioid orders, illegally shipped those orders into Washington for years, and
contributed to the illegal supply of opioids, fueling the states opioid epidemic.
Pullman executed the One Washington Memorandum of Understanding Between Washington
Municipalities (One Washington MOU) on April 26, 2022, in order to participate in the distribution
of funds from statewide opioid epidemic litigation against the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain.
Pullman previously executed a Subdivision Settlement Participation Form and Allocation
Agreement Governing the Allocation of Funds Paid by the Settling Opioid Distributors in
Washington State (Allocation Agreement I) governing the distribution ofsettlement funds
received from McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., AmerisourceBergen Corporation
related to a settlement dated July 21, 2021. Likewise, Pullman previously executed a
Subdivision Settlement Participation Form and Allocation Agreement Governing the Allocation of
Funds Paid by the following Settling Opioid Distributors in Washington State: (1) Walmart, (2)
Teva, (3) Allergan, (4) CVS, and (5) Walgreens in the continuing opioid litigation filed by
Washington state.
In February 2024, the Attorney General announced a settlement had been reached with the
Janssen Defendants: (1) Johnson & Johnson; (2) Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine; (3)
Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; (4) Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and (5)
Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc. in return for Janssens net payment of $123,340,000 plus fees and
costs to the Washington State Attorney General. The settlement funds are to be distributed to
the state of Washington and participating municipalities pursuant to the One Washington MOU.
The settlement payments must be spent to combat the opioid epidemic. As consideration for
these funds, Pullman is required to release any claims it may have against the settling
distributors and agree to be bound by the settlement agreements.
To participate in the settlement agreements and the distribution of the Janssen (Johnson &
Johnson) settlement funds, the city of Pullmanis required to execute the Settlement Participation
Form identified as Exhibit A in the Resolution.

Public Content
Transit service is scheduled to expand to the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport in
mid-May 2024, to coincide with the opening of the airport's new terminal. With the
additional hours required to serve all flights, added Driver, Dispatcher, and
supervisory staffing are also necessary. The service expansion is grant-funded
through June 2025, and the continuation of both the service and associated staffing
will rely on the verification of additional revenue sources as that date approaches. A
brief presentation will address the new staffing demands placed on the Transit

system by service expansion to the airport, show the adjusted staffing organizational
chart, and emphasize the importance of increased revenue for the expanded service
and staffing levels to continue.
