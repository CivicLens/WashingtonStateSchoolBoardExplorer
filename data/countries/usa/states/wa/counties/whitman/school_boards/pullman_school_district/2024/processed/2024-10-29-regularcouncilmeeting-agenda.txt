Public Content
Ordinance 10-23 directs that 50% of retail sales tax revenue collected each quarter (less sales
tax derived from construction activities) in excess of $594,135 be placed in the Restricted CIP
Reserve Fund to be used for capital improvement projects.
Ordinance 12-10 further requires the Finance Director to submit a Quarterly Report of the Citys
retail sales tax revenue collections and financial condition. This provides the City Council an
opportunity to revise the percentage placed into the Restricted CIP Revenue Fund.
The 2024Q3 report attached indicates that the transfer amount by ordinance would be $279,326.
For comparison, the 2023Q3 period amount was $366,053. The year-over-year decrease of
$86,727 is the result of decreased overall sales tax revenue.

Recommended Action :

By motion, accept contract 23-08, Canyon View Trail,
as complete.

Public Content
The scope of contract 23-08, Canyon View Trail, consisted of constructing 2,155
linear feet of 12-foot-wide new or re-built gravel trail and maintenance/refinishing of
1,190 linear feet of 10- to 12-foot-wide existing gravel trail in the vicinity of
Conservation Park, traversing from NW Canyon View Drive to NW Harrison Street.
Work also included constructing a small amount of concrete curb, gutter, and
sidewalk, installing storm sewer pipe and two catch basins, including temporary
erosion and sedimentation control measures, landscape restoration, and other
miscellaneous related work.
The Contractor for this project was East Slope Earthworks, LLC. All work under the
contract was accepted as physically complete, effective August 19, 2024. As of
October 10, 2024, all necessary closing paperwork has been received from the
Contractor to allow for formal acceptance of contract completion by the City Council.
The final contract amount is $277,943.39, a 2.7% increase from the original bid
amount of $270,525.50. The difference stems primarily from costs realized between
actual versus estimated quantities for hydroseeding and crushed surfacing.
A copy of the Final Estimate of Work Completed is attached for reference. The project
was funded from the 2018 Parks and Paths Bond Fund and the Sewer Maintenance
Budget of the Utility Fund.

Existing Business and Occupation Tax on Gross Receipts of
Utilities Paid by Providers

Recommended Action :

Staff recommends the City Council pass Ordinance
No. 24-11 as presented.

Public Content
Due to various economic constraints, the Mayor's Proposed 2025-2026 Biennial Budget shows
General Fund expenditures exceeding the project revenues for the General Fund. Similar to past
budgets, the use of fund balance is needed to help stabilize the General Fund Reserves.
However, unlike past budgets, the gap created by recent inflationary pressures- would draw
down projected reserves at the end of 2026 below the City Council threshold goal of 13%.
To maintain existing General Fund services & program activities and stabilize reserve levels, the
Mayor has proposed a temporary redirection of the portion of Business and Occupation Tax
Revenue currently levied on the gross receipts of utilities paid by the providers of these utilities not the customers. The portion of the revenues to be redirected are exclusive from the Transit
Fund to the General Fund beginning November 1, 2024 and ending December 31, 2026.
This temporary redirection will maintain existing services and programs regularly provided in
Transit as well as in General Fund Departments: Police, Fire, Library, Parks & Recreation,
Community Development, and Finance & Administration. This proposed redirection will meet the
City Council fund reserve threshold goal of 13% across all city funds - including a projected
reserve in the Transit Fund of 56% at the end of 2026.
If the proposed temporary redirection is rejected by the City Council, the General Fund Reserve
at the end of 2026 is estimated to be 4%, creating a $3.1 million shortfall, while the Transit Fund
Reserve would be an estimated 106%.
If the City Council elects to explore alternatives to this redirection, options could include:
Amending Fund Reserve Target Percentage
Reducing or Eliminating Existing Services orPrograms
Eliminate Positions in the General Fund (this may affectexisting serviceand program
delivery)
Increase Revenues
Further Decrease Proposed Budget Expenses
Some Combination of These Alternatives
