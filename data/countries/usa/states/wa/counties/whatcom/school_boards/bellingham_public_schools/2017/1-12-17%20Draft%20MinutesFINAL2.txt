Board President Douglas Benjamin called the meeting to order at 6:17p.m. Present:
Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler, Quenby Peterson,
Steven Smith, Superintendent Greg Baker, and recorder Ruth Rasmussen.
Mr. Benjamin stated that tonight’s meeting is dedicated to Logan and Mackenzie
Echevarria, our Northern Heights students who lost their lives in a plane crash during

silence to honor Logan and Mackenzie and their parents, family and friends.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
 Study Session: The Jan. 26 board meeting will include a study session on
differentiation. Deputy Superintendent Mike Copland will facilitate. He and the
directors briefly discussed key topics to be covered.
 Graduation Requirements: Dr. Baker and Assistant Superintendent Steve
Clarke shared information regarding the new graduation requirements, including
the recommendations from the High School Schedule Implementation Advisory
Group, and they answered directors’ questions.
CONSENT ITEMS:
Prior to the board’s consideration of the consent agenda, Mr. Benjamin read the
following statement:


Item 2.8 of the consent agenda is a contract with North Cascades Institute (NCI). Dr. Baker has recently
accepted a position as an NCI board member. As noted on the agenda, per RCW 42.23.040, the
superintendent’s service as an NCI board member is considered a remote interest. In accordance with the
RCW, Dr. Baker is making no recommendation to the board regarding approval or denial of this contract.
Deputy Superintendent Mike Copland is recommending approval, and assuming the contract is approved, it
will be signed by the board president and Dr. Copland.

Following discussion, Dr. Smith made the following motion, seconded by Mr. Bashaw:
Since the remote interest information is now officially part of the record, the board will
dispense with future readings of the above referenced statement when an NCI contract is
part of the consent agenda. This motion is contingent upon confirmation by legal counsel
that such action meets compliance guidelines. Motion passed unanimously.
