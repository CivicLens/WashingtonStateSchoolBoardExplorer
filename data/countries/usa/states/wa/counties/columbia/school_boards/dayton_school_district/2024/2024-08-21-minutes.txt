  4. District Reports
A. Superintendent's Report
Superintendent Wheatley reported on the organizational chart for the 2024-2025 school year which indicates the staffing in each department and the leads of each department. Principal Cox will supervise the certificated staff and building secretaries, Superintendent Wheatley and Dean of Students Hannelee Farrell will supervise our para professionals and Athletic Director Sam Korslund will supervise coaches. The chart will help with who is in charge of what and the chain of command. Our construction is moving along fairly well now. Our teachers are in the building and the project is in its final stages. The unit is cooling and our custodians have been working hard to clean up and get everything ready for students next week. The grant for the renovation of the football field, track and lighting has been moved to the next phase in the application process. Superintendent Wheatley shared information on policy governance and asked the board to look at items A and B in the document provided. Superintendent Wheatley shared the link from WSSDA for the board self-evaluation. When the board is ready, Mr. Wheatley would like to work on this with the board to get this accomplished.
  B. Business Manager's Report
