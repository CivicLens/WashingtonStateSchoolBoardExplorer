Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Type :

Recommendation:
Approve estimated expenditure for educational services at Healing Lodges of the Seven Nations in the estimated amount of
$306,080.
Background:

The Healing Lodge is a residential treatment facility within the district boundaries that provides services to
children and adolescents. Since this residential treatment program is within district boundaries, the district
is responsible for providing education services for students residing at these facilities. Given the program
and student needs, the educational component is delivered to students by certificated instructors hired by
the contractor with funding under these agreements. The purpose of this delivery model is to provide a
structured learning environment for students who are in treatment, allowing them the opportunity to earn
high school credits, keep up with assignments from their home school, and return to school. The contract
specifies a rate per annual average student FTE served. The average annual student FTE served is
based upon the general instructional program of the district modified to meet the student need.
Expenditures for the satellite school programs are paid out of the general fund.

Meeting :

Recommendation:
Approval of Amendment No. 1 to Contract between Spokane Public Schools and Zum Services Inc. for Student Transportation
Services (RFP1-2223) for the purpose of providing a 3.64% increase in the rate schedule effective August 1, 2024, for an
estimated student transportation expenditureof $15,300,000 for the 2024-2025 school year.
Background:
The District entered into a five-year contract with Zum Services Inc. beginning August 1, 2023. Part of the initial award decision
was based on the fact they offered the best service for the price among the three companies that submitted proposals. The
contract allows for annual adjustments based on the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD) for the second, third, fourth and fifth years. In
the event extraordinary cost increases exceed the IPD, a request for consideration of a larger increase may be presented to the
District. This year, the IPD for the previous 12-month period ending December 31, 2023 is 3.084%; Zum has requested a rate
increase of 3.64%, due to the increases in driver and attendant pay. After reviewing the request and reviewing minimum wage
increase that impacts position pay the increase was deemed reasonable.
The Districts Transportation department has been satisfied with Zum's performance and has determined this price increase to be
fair and reasonable. The estimated contract expenditure for 2024-2025 is approximately $15,300,000. All transportation contract
costs will be paid from the General Fund.

Background:
This recommendation is for the purchase of 60 Nikon Z50 Mirrorless Cameras with lens kit at a cost of $1,246.95, and eight
Canon R50 Mirrorless, at a cost of $926.90 per camera kit. In addition to the cameras, additional lenses and filters will also be
