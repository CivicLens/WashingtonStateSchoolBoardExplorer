OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
September 16, 2020 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Mr. Benjamin called the meeting to order at 6:01 p.m. He acknowledged that this
meeting, while attended from various locations, is being held on the ancestral homelands
of the Coastal Salish people. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin
(President), Camille Diaz Hackler, Jenn Mason, Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker
and Sheri O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
Mr. Benjamin noted that, because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19,
public participation is limited to written submissions only, and all written comments
received will be shared with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all
messages received.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Dr. Baker acknowledged that this is a challenging time for everyone. Families are
facing child care challenges and teachers are teaching in a different way, some
teaching while their own children are participating in remote learning. He shared
some photos received from principals, showcasing what is happening across the
district. Staff are working to get students what they need, such as desks, tables and
music stands. Weekly meal boxes are available for any family needing them. Staff
continue to plan for stage 2 of the Reconnect Plan, which will involve bringing a
small number of students back into our schools while still receiving remote
instruction. It is expected this would include some students who receive special
education services, who are experiencing homelessness and/or those unable to access
Wi-Fi. The district is collaborating with the Whatcom County Health Department as
to when it would be safe to move to stage 2. There has been pressure across the state
from high school athletes to be able to participate in sports. Dr. Baker answered
questions from board members.
• Dr. Baker gave the board an update on student enrollment and status of the budget.
The district has had an approximate 5% drop (575 students) in enrollment, which will
result in a reduction in state funding. Across the region, districts have seen a 0-11%
drop in enrollment, with 5% being a common percentage. Because of a loss of
transportation funding, it will be necessary to furlough some transportation staff.

•

Placing them on furlough will enable those employees to retain health insurance.
Other districts across the state are furloughing other employee groups. Although
health care for substitutes is not funded, changes from the School Employees Benefits
Board (SEBB) require that substitutes be offered health insurance coverage, which is
an additional expense. Unemployment claim costs are another unanticipated expense.
The district has a strong fund balance, and examples of additional funding include
increased enrollment at the Bellingham Family Partnership Program; safety net
funding for students receiving high-cost special education services and funds from the
CARES Act. We have been conservative with spending and have opted not to fill
vacant staff positions. Less money is being spent on field trips, athletics, travel and
professional development. Dr. Baker answered questions from board members
regarding enrollment and the budget.
Dr. Baker provided a brief overview of the Sunnyland Elementary School rebuild
project and introduced Sunnyland Principal Amy Berreth, who reviewed the site and
design plans for the new building and answered questions from board members. Dr.
Baker also introduced Buildings and Grounds Director Mike Anderson, who
responded to questions regarding ventilation and HVAC systems. Dr. Baker and the
board also congratulated Mike on his upcoming retirement.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Mason expressed appreciation for the work of Dr. Baker, the executive team and
the entire staff to get the school year underway. Although there are many challenges
for families, she shared that she has never felt more connected to her daughter’s
school staff and the other students. She also acknowledged that reaching out to
families who may be experiencing difficult times by staff is very much appreciated.
• Ms. Rose expressed that this has been the best start to a school year for her family and
thanked everyone for the work that has been put into making it a successful start. She
also thanked Mr. Benjamin and Ms. Bashaw for drafting a letter to all district staff
from the board.
• Ms. Bashaw works with many parents of children in the district and has heard nothing
but praise and reports of this being the best start ever.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler appreciates Dr. Baker for keeping everyone on track during this
hard time. She hopes that all staff are taking care of themselves and has also heard
positive reports from district parents that things are going well.
• Mr. Benjamin acknowledged that Dr. Baker is sought out at a state level for his
knowledge and expertise, and he thanked Dr. Baker for creating a district and a space
where input from others is sought out. He noted that he misses the board gathering for
linkages, study sessions, etc. and hopes there is a way for the board to connect during
the virtual WSSDA (Washington State School Directors Association) conference in
November.
