Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulg√°b).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time
immemorial and their ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice
the traditional ways of their ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural
traditions passed on to them by their ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these
lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its
Indigenous people, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history,
and can demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
An amendment to the student fee schedule is proposed to increase the Summer School and On-line/Portfolio Learning Tuition from $200 per
.5 credit to $225 per .5 credit. Summer School Program planning is underway and Arlington High School is preparing to send out
communications regarding the program for summer of 2024. Summer school was provided free of charge for students needing credit
recovery or seeking credit advancement during the summers of 2021 and 2022. This was made possible by funding from federal COVID ESSER grants. ESSER funding is no longer available. Tuition collections during the summer of 2023 came to approximately $19,975. The
program operated at a total cost of 47,175 which resulted in a deficit/subsidy of $27,200. The program is estimated to cost approximately
$45,000 this summer. A request to increase the tuition rate is proposed in order to partially offset the cost of this program. In addition, LAP
funds can be utilized for credit recovery and are being directed to provide relief towards the summer school deficit this year.
The District does not receive funding from the state to operate the summer school program. The state does not allow district's to count or
claim summer school enrollment and does not include the program in its regular funding model in any way. The tuition charge will partially
offset the cost of the program along with the redesign of LAP grant funds to help support the program. In the absence of LAP funding, the
deficit of the program would be in the range of $25,000, depending on the number of registrations. Students who qualify for free and reduced
lunch may be eligible for tuition waivers at a reduced price scale of $125 or $50 depending on request and eligibility.
Budgetary Impact:Approximately $4,000
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:Summer School planning is underway and Arlington High School administration is preparing to send
out communications as soon as possible regarding the program for this summer.
