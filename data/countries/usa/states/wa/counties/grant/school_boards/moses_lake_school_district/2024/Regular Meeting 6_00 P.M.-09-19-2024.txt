PE teachers. This impacts intervention times as well as student access to physical activity. The 4 schools that are forced to
share PE teachers are North, Larson, Lake View, Garden Heights.

----- Written Comment(s) ----<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->1. Larry DagnonDear Members of
the Moses Lake School Board, My name is Larry Dagnon. I am a teacher at North and a concerned
citizen. I am writing to express concern over the inequitable distribution of physical education (PE)
resources across our district's schools. While 8 out of the 12 elementary schools are provided with their
own PE teacher, 4 schools, including North Elementary/Larson Elementary and Garden Heights
Elementary/Lakeview Elementary, are forced to share a PE teacher, which creates a significant disparity
in the quality and consistency of physical education instruction and individualized intervention. The lack of
equal access to a dedicated PE teacher at these schools is troubling, as it diminishes the opportunities
for students to receive comprehensive physical education. Notably, North Elementary was never given
the option to rehire its own PE teacher, which further exacerbates the issue. This situation is not only
unfair but also detrimental to the students' educational experience. North and Larson are already deemed
schools of low economic status and trauma. Do we want to continue widening the gap between the
"haves and have-nots"? Will Thurmond from North Elementary and David Peralez from Lakeview
Elementary have been invaluable to their respective school communities. Their dedication and expertise
in promoting physical health and wellness have had a positive impact on the students. Both educators
should be rehired to ensure that these schools have equal access to PE resources and the opportunity
for push-in interventions, just as the majority of schools in our district already do. It is also important to
highlight that equity in education is a key principle under Washington state law. The Revised Code of
Washington (RCW) emphasizes the need for equitable access to educational resources across all
schools. Ensuring that all students, regardless of the school they attend, receive equal opportunities for
physical education is a critical component of this mandate. In Washington State, filing a school equity
complaint involves several steps to ensure that concerns about discrimination or inequitable practices are
properly addressed. First, the complainant should raise the issue with the school's administration, such
as the principal, to seek resolution at the local level. If the issue is not resolved, a formal complaint can
be filed with the school district's Equity Compliance Officer or the Title IX Coordinator, depending on the
nature of the concern. The district is required to follow a specific process to investigate the complaint,
typically beginning with a written submission detailing the issue. The district will then conduct an
investigation, which may involve interviewing relevant parties and reviewing documentation. According to
Washington State law, the district must respond to the complaint in writing within a set timeframe, usually
within 30 days. If the complainant is unsatisfied with the district's response, they have the option to
appeal to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). OSPI will review the case and
make a final decision. Throughout the process, the district is obligated to ensure a fair and impartial
investigation, in compliance with state regulations aimed at promoting educational equity for all students.
For students living in poverty, physical education (PE) offers vital benefits that extend beyond physical
fitness. Many students from low-income backgrounds lack access to safe spaces for physical activity,

organized sports, or recreational programs outside of school. PE provides a structured environment
where they can engage in regular exercise, which is essential for their physical health and development.
Additionally, physical activity can serve as a powerful tool for reducing stress and improving mental
health, especially for students who may face the challenges of economic instability or family stress. PE
also promotes social interaction and teamwork, helping students build relationships, communication
skills, and self-esteem. Importantly, for students in poverty, PE can introduce healthy habits and provide
knowledge about nutrition and wellness that they might not receive at home, empowering them to make
healthier lifestyle choices. By promoting both physical and mental well-being, PE plays a crucial role in
leveling the playing field for students of all economic backgrounds, helping them succeed academically
and socially. I urge the school board to address this inequity and ensure that every school in our district is
provided with a full-time PE teacher. This is essential for the physical, mental, and emotional
development of our students, as well as for promoting fairness across the district. Thank you for your
attention to this important matter. I look forward to your response and hope that swift action will be taken
to rectify this situation. Sincerely, Larry Dagnon
