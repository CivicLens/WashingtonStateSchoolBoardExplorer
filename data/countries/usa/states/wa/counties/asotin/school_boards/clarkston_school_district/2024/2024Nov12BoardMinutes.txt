REPORTS
Certification of Levy
(Dani Lynas, Executive Director of Financial Services)
Resolution 24-07, Certification of 2025 Excess Property Taxes
Resolution 24-08, Certification of 2025 Capital Excess Levy Property Taxes
Dani explained that these resolutions authorize the county to collect taxes on behalf
of the district, ensuring the district receives the approved levy funds. The tax money
is critical for daily operations, covering expenses that state and federal funding, as
well as grants, do not fully address. Examples include rising utility costs and
increased insurance premiums, both of which have seen a 30% increase in Clarkston

School District alone.

Board members discussed the potential value of dedicating a webpage to educate the
community about how tax revenues are allocated and utilized within the district.
