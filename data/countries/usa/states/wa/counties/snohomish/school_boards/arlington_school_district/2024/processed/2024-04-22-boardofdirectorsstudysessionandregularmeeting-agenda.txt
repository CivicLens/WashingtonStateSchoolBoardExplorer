Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulgáb).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time immemorial and their
ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice the traditional ways of their
ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural traditions passed on to them by their
ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its Indigenous people,
as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history, and can
demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.

Meeting :

Apr 22, 2024 - Board of Directors Study Session and
Regular Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the Budget and Enrollment
Reports as presented.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
March Budget Reports:
Fund balance and net cash: The beginning fund balance for the 2023-24 year was $3.8 million. As of the end of March 2024, the fund
balance was $69,649 (compared to $4 million last March 2023) and net cash is approximately $2.3 million (compared to $4 million last
March 2023). These balances have decreased from the previous month and while it is consistent with the normal pattern at this time of year,
it is at a significantly lower balance across this fiscal year than in prior years. Consistent with prior year trends, fund balance, net cash, and
revenues show a large spike in October and April from receipt of a large portion of local property taxes. The months following these large
influxes show declines especially since the state apportionment allocation in November and June is only 5%, and July is only 6% of the total
allocation versus 9% in most of the other months. Expenditures remain at a fairly consistent monthly level. A short-term temporary interfund
loan from the Capital Projects was not necessary for the months of January, February, or March. A short-term temporary interfund loan from
Capital Projects is almost certain to be needed for the month of June which is typically the lowest point in the year for fund balance.
Local Tax Revenue: The district has received 50.79% of total budgeted General Fund tax revenues for the 2023-24 fiscal year. Tax
revenues received year-to-date amount to $4.8 million of the $9.6 million budgeted.
State Apportionment Revenues: The district's State Apportionment allocation is increased since actual average full-time equivalent (FTE)
enrollment is approximately 117 more than budgeted enrollment. In November, the District requested OSPI to adjust the enrollment figure
used to disburse the District's monthly allocation, to a level that would more closely align with the increase in enrollment that the district was
experiencing. This allowed the district to receive needed revenues earlier and supported cash flow levels for November and December. The
amount of the increase will be more evident with January's apportionment which is when the State makes its annual 'true-up' on its payments
to school districts. January is when the state adjusts from paying school districts based on budgeted average student FTE to payments
based on ACTUAL average student FTE. The remaining increase in apportionment is than spread from January to August. The overall
increase in revenues for additional enrollment is estimated to be between $1-1.5 million dollars.
April Enrollment Report:

The April 2024 enrollment reports are submitted for Board review and approval. Actual enrollment for April 2024 was 5,423.34 FTE (FullTime-Equivalent). April enrollment increased 4 FTE compared to March's enrollment. The average FTE taking into consideration September
through April monthly enrollments is 5,430.51. This is 116.51 FTE more than budgeted enrollment of 5,314.00.
Compared to 2022-23 average enrollment, the district is serving approximately 67.5 more student FTE in 2023-24 than the year before.
Previous Board Action:
Board acceptance of Budget Reports for February 2024 occurred at the March 25, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.
March enrollment was approved by the Board during the March 25, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.

Background Information:
The district is in the middle of budgeting for the 2024-25 fiscal year. Information on the progress of the budget development will be brought to
the board on a monthly basis to keep board members informed.
The legislature adjourned it's session in March and has adopted a new budget for the state which has impacts on school budgets.
Revenues: The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI)budget and forecasting software tools have recently become available.
The district is working on the necessary data input items to support its 2024-25 revenue forecasts. The district has also developed some
preliminary revenue estimates so that budget planning could move forward.
Expenditures: Human resources has been working on the large project of setting up all employee contract data in the financial software
system using estimated data since collective bargaining is underway and will govern the actual outcomes of next years salaries to be
applied. Extensive processes of review are being conducted to ensure data is as accurate and complete as possible before running the files
through the State's budget development software, the F195.
Official Budget Document: The OSPI required budget format is called Form F-195. A four-year budget and enrollment forecast is also
required in a format called Form F-195F. A draft of both of these documents will be brought to the board for review and consideration as
soon as feasibly possible, but no later than the July 8, 2024 regular board meeting. As required by law, the budget draft will be posted on the
district's website and will be submitted to the Northwest Educational Service District for review no later than July 10, 2024. The final draft of
the 2024-25 Arlington Public Schools Budget will come to the board for a public hearing and consideration of a resolution to adopt the 202425 budget and the 4-year forecaston August 12, 2024.
The board will hear more about these details as per the attached presentation.
Previous Board Meetings:
Projected enrollment for 2024-25 was approved at the January 22, 2024, regular board meeting.
A budget development briefing was presented during the March 25, 2024, regular board meeting.
DRAFT Resolution 24-03 for a 2024-2025 Reduced Educational Program, was reviewed at the April 16, 2024, special board meeting.

Submitted by:
Dr. Chrys Sweeting, Superintendent; and
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
The district does not have assured financial resources to maintain its program and services at the present levels for the 2024-25 fiscal year.
It is necessary to make reductions in the district's educational program for the 2024-25 fiscal year in order to maintain a level of expenditures
within reasonably anticipated resources.
Many school districts across Washington State are experiencing similar challenges either in the prior year, the current fiscal year or will be
making adjustments in the next fiscal years due to similar situations as what the district is experiencing. The primary issues which are
contributing to the need for making reductions include, a) inflation which is not only causing higher costs for goods and services but also for
staffing costs that are increasing with the anticipated cost-of-living increases and negotiated salary increases across multiple labor groups;
b) exhaustion of pandemic induced federal and state aid which were non-recurring funds; c) enrollment declines that have not recovered to
pre-pandemic levels; d) maintenance of higher staffing levels during and directly after the pandemic as schools were directly tasked with
mitigating impacts of the pandemic and taking measures to accelerate student learning; e) use of one-time excess fund balance and
minimum reserves during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 fiscal year; f) and the State's funding model that continues to lead to funding gaps.
Specific to the State's funding model, challenges include declining regionalization, and continued state underfunding of the true costs of
education (special education, and staffing costs outside the prototypical school funding model).
Previous presentations to the Board about financial highlights of the current budget have continually indicated that future year forecasts
signal a need to make reductions by a minimum of $2.5 million dollars. Projections and estimates for 2024-2025 revenues and expenditures
are continually being compiled and updated under changing circumstances. Decisions must be made at this juncture so that appropriate
preparations can be made with the goal of achieving an appropriately balanced budget for the next fiscal year. With the uncertainty of these
matters in mind, the present range of potential reduction could fall between $2.5 and $3 million.
The Budget Advisory Task Force (BATF) was formed near the beginning of the 2022-23 fiscal year and has continued to meet during the
2023-24 fiscal year. Input was sought from members comprised of community, staff, parents, and students, which has informed the decision
making process both for nearly $5.9 million in budget reductions made for the 2023-2024 fiscal year and has continued around an additional
$2.5+million being planned for the 2024-25 budget. The district presented a DRAFT Resolution for a Reduced Educational Program and a
DRAFT plan for approximately $2.8 million worth of cost savings, reductions, or increased revenues at the April 16, 2024 board meeting for
comment and discussion. The Resolution and Plan are now being presented to the Board for consideration of adoption.
Budgetary Impact:
$2.5+ Million
Sensitivity of Board Approval:
State law requires that certificated employees must be notified in writing of non-renewal of their employment contract on or before May 15.
RCW 28A.405.210andRCW 28A.405.220.
Approval of a Reduced Educational Program Resolution by the April 22, 2024 board meeting facilitates the process by helping ensure that
employees affected by said plan may be timely notified prior to the May 15 deadline.
