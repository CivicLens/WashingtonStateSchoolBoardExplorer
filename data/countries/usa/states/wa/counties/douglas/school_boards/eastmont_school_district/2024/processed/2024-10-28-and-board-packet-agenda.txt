Orchestra to visit Spokane, WA overnight and then out-of-state to Silverwood in Athol,
Idaho. This will take place on May 30-31, 2025. In addition to the high school students,
there will be 2 staff chaperones and 12 parents in attendance. The cost to the students
to attend is approx. $75-150 with fundraising and miscellaneous charitable funds
available. The remaining costs will be paid from the EHS ASB budget. A copy of the
