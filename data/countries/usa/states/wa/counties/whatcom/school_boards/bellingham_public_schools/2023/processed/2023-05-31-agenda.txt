Explanation of Issue:
On February 16, 2023, the school board approved Resolution 07-23, allowing the district to participate in an alternative public works
contracting process known as General Contractor/Construction Manager (GC/CM) for the Elementary School #15 project. In March 2023,
the Capital Projects Review Boards Project Review Committee formally authorized utilization of the GC/CM process.

On March 24, 2023, the district publicly advertised a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) from firms interested in providing GC/CM services for
the Elementary School #15 project. Eight firms responded by providing Statements of Qualifications (SOQs): Bayley Construction;
BNBuilders; Cornerstone General Contractors; Dawson Construction, LLC; Faber Construction Corp.; Howard S. Wright; Lydig Construction,
Inc.; and Tiger Construction LTD.

A selection committee comprised of Chief Operations Officer Jessica Sankey; Director of Capital Projects Curtis Lawyer; Director of Facilities
and Sustainability Mark Peterson; Director of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Janis Velasquez Farmer; Procurement Specialist Austin
Scheffer; Capital Projects Manager Corey Ayers; and Associate Principal of Dykeman Architects Zach Ham reviewed the SOQs and
selected BNBuilders, Cornerstone General Contractors and Lydig Construction as the most highly qualified to continue on in the selection
process.The committee then conducted formal interviews with these three firms on May 10, 2023.

On May 10, 2023, a Request for Fee Proposal (RFFP) was issued to the three firms.In the RFFP we asked for fee amounts related to base
fee and specified general condition fees (all staff costs for the project).

After combining the qualification scores and fee scores, BNBuilders earned the highest score of 96 points, followed by Lydia Construction
with 87.63 and Cornerstone General Contractors with 83.13 points. The Elementary School #15 GC/CM Scoring Summary is attached.

Based on the above, approval is requested to contract with BNBuilders to provide General Contractor Construction Manager Services for the
new Elementary School #15 project. Attached is the negotiated contract ready for signature.
