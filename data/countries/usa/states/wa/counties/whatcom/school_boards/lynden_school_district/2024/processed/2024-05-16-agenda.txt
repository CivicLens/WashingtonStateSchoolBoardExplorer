Lynden High School administered over 200 AP exams this month. Students signed up for these classes in an effort to earn
college credits.

Vossbeck Elementary students participated in Bike To School Day on May 8th. They had 123 students ride their bikes to school
on a beautiful sunny morning!
Isom Elementary completed their spring bike safety unit for 4th and 5th graders during PE class. Students spent the first two
weeks practicing in a coned off portion of the parking lot, and then ventured onto city streets and neighborhoods during the
third week while practicing hand signals, right of way, and traffic navigation. The bikes were secured through a grant from the
Washington State Department of Transportation and are shared between the three elementary schools.
Lynden High School hosted study intervention groups called "Sunrise & Study" during the late start state testing schedule.
While the work originally focused on freshmen, they invited all other grades as well. Students made significant academic
progress with content specific educators there to support them!

Fisher Elementary is showing some great growth through their targeted interventionist program utilizing the University of
Florida Literacy Institute Intervention curriculum that is aligned with the science of reading and our new CKLA curriculum. All
grade levels exceeded the average number of expected growth by 150%-215%. These intervention groups included Tier II and
Tier III students.
Vossbeck Elementary's librarian, Mrs. Grewal, taught students about poetry and helped some of them enter the Young
American Poetry Digest's annual poetry contest. Thirty three students in grades 1-5 were selected as contest winners and had
their work published! Congratulations!
Vossbeck Elementary's STEAM teacher and the BVE PTA hosted their first Egg Drop. Students interested in this fun science
experiment had to fill out an application, submit it to Mrs. VanHulzen, and bring their egg baskets to BVE for an evening event.
Fifty students and their families arrived with creative egg basket designs and had fun watching them being dropped from high
up!
Lynden Middle School hosted an event for our Migrant Program on Saturday, May 4th. Dr. Veronica Velez spoke to students
during the morning session about resiliency and being well-educated- both within the context of individual cultures and as a
minority in the country. The afternoon session was aimed towards parents and Dr. Velez asked what they would like to see
happening in their children's schools. A lengthy discussion followed on their desire to see their students' cultural backgrounds
reflected in their school environments and the importance of promoting education at home.
