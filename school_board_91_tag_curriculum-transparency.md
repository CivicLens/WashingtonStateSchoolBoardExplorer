## 2024-07-30 - PULLMAN_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The City Council of Pullman held a regular meeting on July 30, 2024, where several key items were discussed and resolutions were passed. Notably, the Council adopted Resolution No. R-50-24, which creates a Temporary Biosolids Fee for sewer utility consumers due to unanticipated expenses related to the hauling of biosolids to composting facilities. This decision was prompted by actions from the Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board and the Washington State Department of Ecology, preventing the city from land applying biosolids as previously practiced. The fee structure includes a monthly base fee and a fee per CCF for different account types, with Washington State University being responsible for 36.4% of the costs. Additionally, community members expressed their ongoing requests for a ceasefire resolution during the meeting, reflecting local concerns. The meeting concluded with no new business or executive session, and it adjourned at 7:42 p.m.
