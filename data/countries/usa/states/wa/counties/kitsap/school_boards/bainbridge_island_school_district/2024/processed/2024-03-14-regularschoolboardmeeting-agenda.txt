Re: Policy 3122Excused and Unexcused Absences
First Reading
__________________________________________________________________
In June of 2022, WSSDA Policy and Legal News wrote an article from a students perspective on attendance and mental health.
The article referenced House Bill 1834. In House Bill 1834, the legislature recognized that students' mental health is a
component of their physical health and students' mental health can affect their ability to learn. Students across the state provided
personal experiences of mental health struggles for themselves and their peers to advocate for this bill. They also had hopes that
this bill would address the stigma of talking about mental health and seeking support for mental health. The bill passed and
districts were provided guidance to make mental health symptoms, illness, health conditions, or medical appointments allowable
reasons for an excused absence.
Although this BISD policy is being recommended for formal updates now, the option to excuse absences for mental health
reasons has been allowable in our district for some time. Our district also monitors student attendance, including excessive
excused absences. We have a collective goal to have all students at school and want to support understanding the cause of
excessive absences, excused and unexcused, to support the students and families.
I recommend approval of Policy 3122 Excused and Unexcused Absences First Reading.

From: Sean Eaton, Career and Technical Education Director
Re: Policy 2401 Financial Education Mastery-Based Learning and Credit - First Reading

Policy 2401 is a new policy to the Bainbridge Island School District. The policy clarifies that the district will promote financial
education to offer mastery-based credit for students who demonstrate theyve met the Washington State K12 Learning Standard
for financial education. Important to note, WAC 180-51-050 requires local school boards to adopt an authorizing policy before
districts can award mastery-based credit.
According to the policy, the district will encourage students to learn financial education effectively at a high level of proficiency.
The district also recognizes the importance of allowing students to learn at their own pace, and the educational benefits that can
be gained by giving students the opportunity to demonstrate competency of skills, proficiency of standards, and mastery of
concepts. This is an Encouraged policy.
I recommend the board approve the first reading of Board Policy 2401 Financial Education Mastery-Based Learning and Credit.
