The Ferndale School District No. 502 school board held a special session to review applications for the vacant Director Position No. 3.  The board discussed the selection process outlined in Policy 1114P, which requires interviewing the five candidates with the most relevant experience and community representation. Due to an impasse on selecting five candidates, the board voted to suspend Policy 1114P and interview only four candidates: Cindy Cultee, Katie Dorr, Patricia Dunn, and Toni Jefferson. The decision was made to avoid relinquishing the responsibility of filling the vacancy to the Educational Service District (ESD) 189 Board.
