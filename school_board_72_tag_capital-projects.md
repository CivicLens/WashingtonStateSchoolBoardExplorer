## 2024-02-26 - WAPATO_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Wapato School District Board of Directors held a public meeting on February 26, 2024, at 4:30 PM, focusing on a work session regarding the 2024 Capital Projects. Executive Director Kevin Hill presented a detailed overview of completed and projected capital projects, including their estimated costs and identified service needs such as major, minor, athletic, deferred maintenance, and safety. The Board engaged in discussions about the selection process for companies to undertake these projects, emphasizing that all major projects over $45,000 require three bids, with the lowest bid being selected. Concerns were raised regarding the limited use of local companies, which Mr. Hill attributed to state requirements that companies must meet, including sex offender checks and necessary permits.

The Board reviewed Hill's recommendations for prioritizing 12 capital projects for 2024 and requested the addition of Partitions for the Middle School to the list. Mr. Hill and Mr. Garza will revise the priority projects based on the Board's feedback and present the final recommendations for approval at the next school board meeting. The work session concluded at 5:30 PM, with the meeting adjourned by Board President John Francisco.
