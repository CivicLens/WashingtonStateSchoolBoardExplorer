Any resident may run for election to the board providing the candidate meets certain legal qualifications. Board members serve without pay. In Washington, education is defined as a function of the state government by the constitution. Legislative actions have created school boards to serve as agents of the state to administer the school functions which have been delegated to local districts. School board members are responsible to the voters and act under the restrictions of state law. The board provides direction for the district, approving policies, making financial decisions, validating strategic planning long-range goals, and approving the budget. The progress of the district is reviewed regularly by the board. The board relies on the superintendent for advice, but final decisions are the responsibility of the school board.

I ran for school director because as a parent I d want someone balanced and practical to be at the table making decisions that could impact my child, and I feel I can be that for other families. At the end of the day I want all our kids to be prepared for life after school, in whatever form that takes.
