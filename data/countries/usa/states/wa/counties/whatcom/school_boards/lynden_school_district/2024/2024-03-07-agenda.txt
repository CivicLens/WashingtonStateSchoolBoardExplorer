Isom Elementary's Character Strong word of the month in February was "Cooperation". Isom's tech lab was in need of
keyboard covers to use for the development of keyboarding skills. Isom Tech Coach, Mrs. Bowman, connected with LMS
woodshop teacher, Mr. Klassen, who created a design to meet their needs. With the help of Isom alum and current LMS
student, Owen Bennett, they helped build 28 keyboard covers!
