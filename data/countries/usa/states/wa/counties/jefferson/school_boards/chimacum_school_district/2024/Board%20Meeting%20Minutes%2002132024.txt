2 Questions
1 Item from the above for discussion

Dr. Mauk explained how the report highlights the concern areas and helps us understand what we need
to focus on and improve. The board members brough up the concerns of bullying in the schools,
strength of student course work, low percentages of community involvement, and communications
between the schools and families. Dr. Mauk agreed to investigate the concerns further and speak with
the building leaders on how we can work together to find solutions to the issues.
Principalship
Dr. Mauk Presented on the Principalship in CSD. He pointed out that in small school districts such as CSD
the principals take on multiple roles. Dr. Mauk highlighted the importance of consistency of leadership
and staff. More turnover of the leadership, or staff is not ideal for student learning and growth. Dr.
Mauk described what concepts he uses for principal evaluations and the timelines.
Board Discussion
Director Mike Aman gave an update on the 2024 Legislative Conference and Day on the Hill. Student
directors, Reid and Isaac noted it was a broad experience to speak and listen to other student directors,
