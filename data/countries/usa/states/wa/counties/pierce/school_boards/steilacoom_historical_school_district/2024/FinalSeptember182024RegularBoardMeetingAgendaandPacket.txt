To:

Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

From: Shawn Lewis
Subject: Financial Update
Attached are the Budget Status Reports for all funds as of the end of August 2024, along with
charts and data showing our monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund cash
balance.
Our General Fund Balance as of ƵŐƵƐƚ 31 is $3,868,445. Based on my initial review of yearend financial information, we will have small amounts of state recovery (amounts we will pay
back) and funding in LAP and CTE that are required to be carried over into the 2024-25 school
year. Even taking all those into account, and estimating the number of invoices still
outstanding – I expect that we will have a final ending fund balance this year that meets the 6%
of prior year expenditures target.
Revenue exceedƐ our overall target for the year – thanks in large part to the federal
government sending nearly $500,000 more than originally anticipated.
Annual expenses came in under our budget for the year – thanks in large part to our capital levy
addressing costs for non-voted debt, technology, and capital safety expenses.
Our apital Wrojects &und ends the year with just over $1 million in fund balance after we made
a transfer of $1.625 million for a debt service payment due in December.
The ASB fund will end the year spending about $50,000 more than revenue – but this is a
positive as they are spending down excess fund balance.
Final adjustments to the financial statements will be completed by the October board meeting
and I will include draft financial statements at that meeting.

Packet page 102 of 139

The district's General Fund Balance as of July 31 is $3,596,905. This $3.6 million fund balance is
above 2021-22 fund balance levels. Cash with the County Treasurer amounted to $3.4 million. The
difference is for prepaid expenses that have been made for the 2024-25 school year.
Mr. Lewis shared he is in the process of looking at all our program and grant expenditures to ensure
district spending levels are sufficient to retain all our revenue – and it appears the district will have
carryover in some programs. This is a condition that exists when the state has provided the district
resources in a program but the district has not yet spent enough in that program to exhaust the
funding. When this happens, the overall fund balance will be higher – but the district will need to
spend more money in the next year to spend down those resources.
One large expense anticipated for July was for Running Start at Pierce College, but they did not send
their invoice in time for July payment. This $500,000 expense will be processed in August – so July
expenses are lower than normal and August will be higher than normal.
In August, the district will also be making a transfer from the Capital Projects Fund to the Debt
Service Fund for a debt payment to be made in December.
No other expenses or revenue are different from expectations in the General Fund.
V. RECESS TO PUBLIC HEARING
Chair Scott recessed to Public Hearing at 6:20 p.m.
VI. PUBLIC HEARING
A. 2024-25 Budget and 2023-24 Budget Extension Hearing
Assistant Superintendent Shawn Lewis shared regarding the 2023-24 Budget Extension, Mr.
Lewis shared the 2023-24 school year budget was originally adopted by the board in the
summer of 2023.
As previously discussed with the board in monthly budget status updates beginning in
September 2023: Enrollment in Running Start was significantly higher than anticipated,
creating an unanticipated cost of nearly $700,000 Overall enrollment in the district is lower
than our original projection Actual revenue has changed from our original projections, with
some decreases due to enrollment changes and some increases due to increased grant
activity and other factors A planned transfer from the general fund to the debt service fund
is no longer necessary due to the passage of the capital projects levy. The budget revision
being considered has been reviewed by the Educational Service District and has posted on
our website since July 3, 2024.
The budget extension request reflects an increase to the General Fund expenditure budget
from $51,062,265 plus a $450,000 transfer to $51,746,265 of expenditure authority.
Director Rohrer questioned if the entire budget extension amount is not used, where those
funds go. Mr. Lewis shared that money stays in the bank and builds the district's fund
balance.
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

Page 2 of 8

Packet page 103 of 139

Mr. Lewis then shared the proposed 2024-25 Budget and 2023-24 Budget Extension. The
2024-25 budget was presented to the board in June and has been available for public review
and comment. The ESD has reviewed the budget document and has approved it for
submission to OSPI pending board approval.
As indicated in the resolution, approval would allow the 2025 collection of our educational
programs and operations levy as well as the capital projects and technology levy – both
approved by voters. The resolution also authorizes an appropriation level for each of the
funds managed by the district. Finally, the resolution allows for a transfer of capital projects
levy funding to the debt service fund for the purpose of debt repayment.
The biggest risk factor for the district is related to enrollment projections. The district
consulted with a demographer for use with our budget estimates, but future enrollment
trends are unknown and may have negative or positive impacts to future revenue and
spending plans.
Despite this risk, the 2024-25 budget is responsible and conservative. The superintendent
continues to provide close oversight of spending and the district will continue to monitor
enrollment and spending closely.
B. Comments from the Audience Regarding Public Hearing
No comments.
VII. RETURN TO REGULAR MEETING
Chair Scott returned to the Board Regular Meeting at 6:30 p.m.
VIII. CONSENT AGENDA

D. First Reading of Policy 3205 Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of Students
Prohibited
Ms. Beauchaine shared Policy 3205 Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of

Department of Education went into effect. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is
the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or
activities receiving federal financial assistance. These rules outline K-12 public schools’
obligations to provide an educational environment free from sex-based discrimination and
specify how schools must respond to notice and complaints of sex-based discrimination.
WSSDA has provided revised model policies to ensure school districts are in compliance. The
revisions include - emphasizing the district’s commitment to provide a safe and
nondiscriminatory learning and working environment for students and staff; expanding the

and Title IV.
E. First Reading of Policy 5011 Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of District Staff
Prohibited
Ms. Beauchaine shared Policy 5011 Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of District
Staff Prohibited. On August 1, 2024, the 2024 Title IX Rules issued by the U.S. Department of
Education went into effect. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is the federal law
that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving
federal financial assistance. These rules outline K-12 public schools’ obligations to provide
an educational environment free from sex-based discrimination and specify how schools
must respond to notice and complaints of sex-based discrimination. WSSDA has provided
revised model policies to ensure school districts are in compliance. The revisions include emphasizing the district’s commitment to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory learning and
working environment for students and staff; expanding the definition of “sexual
harassment," and clarifying the annual district notice requirements.
Director Rohrer made a motion to approve Policy 5011 Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based
Harassment of Staff Prohibited, Director McDonald seconded the motion, and the motion
passed (5/0).
F. First Reading of Policy 4130 Title 1, Part A Parent and Family Engagement
In Dr. Vallieres’ absence, Mr. Lewis shared Policy 4130 Title I, Part A Parent and Family
Engagement. He shared revisions to this policy reflect recently updated Title I, Part A law to
better support disadvantaged students. Outdated language was removed from the policy
and replaced.
Director Roher shared she believes the district has done really well engaging families,
especially post COVID. She questioned what are the greatest barriers to Title I parent
participation. Dr. Weight shared school attendance is the largest barrier and it is important
for the district to share with these families the importance of attendance. The district also
offers programs including after-school tutoring for these students. Mr. Lewis shared there
are also economic challenges for these families, but our principals and staff do an excellent
job at bridging the gap.
Director McDonald asked if Title I applies to all grade levels. Mr. Lewis said it does, but the
district is required to use it based on poverty levels. In SHSD that means Anderson Island
first, then Cherrydale, and then there is some fluctuation year-to-year on other district
schools. The district is required to spend more money per student at the schools with the
highest poverty level.
Director Lewis made a motion to approve Policy 4130 Title I, Part A Parent and Family
Engagement; Director McDonald seconded the motion; and the motion passed (5/0).
G. First Reading of Policy 6220 Bid or Request for Proposal Requirements
Mr. Lewis shared Policy 6220 Bid or Request for Proposal Requirements. He shared Policy
6220 outlines the requirements for purchasing using district funds, and specifically identifies

Page 5 of 8

Packet page 106 of 139

when the district needs to conduct certain procurement processes in order to be in
compliance with state and federal law.
The policy revisions presented to the board are intended to incorporate changes to bid
laws pertaining to small works rosters based on the changes in SSB 5268 Public Works
Procurement. The policy updates the statutory references for small works rosters. There is
an associated procedure update that will provide more specifics to staff related to small
works roster projects. reflect the language in the statutes authorizing interlocal agreements
for procurement, as well as best practices as identified by the State Auditor’s Office. There is
much more detail information about who the district may use interlocal agreements to
purchase through a different entities’ competitive solicitation. These policy changes will
result in some changes to internal processes to ensure compliance.
Director Tinsley made a motion to approve Policy 6220 Bid or Request for Proposal
Requirements, Director Lewis seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
H. Suspension of Policy 6022 - Minimum Fund Balance
Mr. Lewis shared the district’s minimum fund balance Policy 6022 recognizes the
importance of maintaining a prudent fund balance in the general fund to ensure operational
cash flow needs are met and to set aside resources for known obligations and to help
protect against unforeseen circumstances.
The policy requires the superintendent annually to present a general fund budget that
includes a commitment of at least 6% of the prior year’s expenditures towards a minimum
fund balance.
The school board formally suspended this policy for the 2023-24 school in recognition of the
district’s financial situation at the time.
Under the direction of the superintendent, district staff have continued to make progress to
restore fund balances – but the 2024-25 school year budget still reflects a budget plan that
results in the district’s general fund balance being lower than the 6% target level at yearend.
The 2024-25 budget as outlined in Resolution 927-08-21-24 reflects the district’s ongoing
programs and services plan and anticipates an ending fund balance is projected to be nearly
4% of prior year expenditures. Because this level is below 6%, a temporary suspension of
policy 6022 is recommended.
Policy 1320 allows the board to suspend a policy by a majority vote of the members present,
provided all board members have received a notice of the meeting and the notice includes a
proposal to suspend the policy and an explanation of the purpose.
Director McDonald made a motion to approve suspending Policy 6022 Minimum Fund
Balance, Director Tinsley seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).

I.

Approval of 2024-25 School Year Fee Schedule
Mr. Lewis shared the SHSD 2024-25 School Year Student Fee Schedule. All ASB fee changes
recommended have gone through the appropriate ASB process for approval. School meal
prices are proposed to increase by 25 cents per meal again this year. This is due to a
combination of food price increases, labor cost increases, and added costs due to
Cherrydale students receiving breakfast for free in the upcoming school year. While we had
not anticipated another increase, we had also not anticipated the inflationary pressures or
state law changes that have been implemented.
Director Rohrer made a motion to approve the SHSD 2024-25 School Year Fee Schedule,
Director McDonald seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
Director Rohrer asked if the past legislative session passed something for school lunches.
Mr. Lewis shared we will receive some extra funding, but the federal government only gives
us money for students who actually qualify for free lunch. The state gives us funding up to a
percentage, which is still lower than what we actually spend.
Director McDonald verified if a student ate both breakfast and lunch every day throughout
the school year, the increase to families would be $90/year. Mr. Lewis verified that was
correct.

J.

2024-25 Board Governance Goal Development
Dr. Weight shared that annually, the board conducts a self-assessment to evaluate its own
performance in terms of generally accepted principles of successful board operations and
the Washington School Board Standards. The Board reviews the results of their selfassessment and uses the results as a part of their governance goal setting process
(consistent with Board Policies 1810 and 1820).
All five Board members completed their assessment on June 21, 2024. Results were
tabulated by WSSDA. The self-assessment data is presented today for Board discussion and
for the development of this year’s governance goals.
At next month's meeting, the Board is scheduled to adopt their Board Governance Goals.
Since it has been less than a year since the last adoption of goals, Dr. Weight suggested it
may be beneficial to carry those goals over for another year.
The board agreed with Dr. Weight's suggestion.

K. Board Goal - Professional Learning
Regarding the board’s goal to function efficiently and effectively, Director Rohrer took notes
and "scored" the board at tonight's meeting. The role will move to other directors in future
meetings.
XI. BOARD COMMUNICATION
Director Tinsley mentioned an email received by Dr. Weight and forwarded to the board regarding
electric buses.

CONSENT AGENDA: Out of Endorsement 2024-2025
Strategic Focus Area
☒ Achieve
☒ Support

☐ Connect
☒ Plan
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Per WAC 181-82-110, teachers may teach outside of their endorsement area if certain conditions are
met. If individuals are assigned outside of their endorsement area, the following needs to happen:
•
•

•

The out-of-endorsement assignment needs to be approved by the local school board.
The district and the teacher “mutually develop a written plan” for assistance to the teacher. The
plan needs to provide “a reasonable amount of planning and study time associated specifically
with the out-of-endorsement assignment.” Plans might include mentoring, PLC time with teachers
in the content area, taking a course, independent study, and so on. Although it may, the plan does
not have to include acquiring the endorsement.
There are no out-of-endorsement provisions for CTE teachers.

For the 2024-2025 school year, the district has identified an additional teacher who will be
assigned a course that meets the definition of out of endorsement. During the school year,
teachers will access options such as, taking the appropriate endorsement test; attending
professional development; and attending professional learning communities.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Annually, the board conducts a self-assessment to evaluate its own performance in terms of generally accepted
principles of successful board operations and the Washington School Board Standards. The Board reviews the results of
their self-assessment and uses the results as a part of their governance goal setting process (consistent with Board
Policies 1810 and 1820).
All five Board members completed their assessment on June 21, 2024. Results were tabulated by WSSDA. The Board’s
2023-24 Governance Goals were adopted in December, 2023:
GOAL 1: By the end of the academic year, each school board member will attend a minimum of three relevant
professional development sessions focused on governance best practices, with the aim of enhancing their knowledge and
skills in effective decision-making. Progress will be measured through documented attendance records, reflections on key
takeaways, and the application of acquired knowledge in at least one board meeting or policy discussion.
GOAL 2: Board members will actively contribute to their professional growth and help foster a culture of continuous
learning by committing to read a minimum of one relevant article or book chapter per month, sharing key takeaways and
insights. The chosen readings will directly align with Board responsibilities, providing insights on emerging trends and
successful strategies in the field of governance. Board members will engage in regular discussions and reflections on the
readings during monthly board meetings.
GOAL 3: Board members will actively contribute to their roles, staying connected with district priorities and fostering a
strong partnership between the board, district administration, staff, families, and the community by attending a
minimum of six district/school-sponsored events throughout the academic year. Board members will also offer
community engagement opportunities, like “coffee chats”, to stakeholders.
The Board is interested in the continuation of these governance goals for 2024-25, in lieu of choosing new focus areas.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
It is the recommendation to adopt the 2024-25 Board Governance Goals.

Students

STUDENT DISCIPLINE
Introduction/Philosophy/Purpose
The Board of the Steilacoom Historical School District focuses on the educational achievement
of each and every student. The District holds high expectations for all students and gives all students the opportunity to achieve personal and academic success. “Discipline” means any action
taken by the school district in response to behavioral violations, including exclusionary as well
as positive and supportive forms of discipline. The Board intends that this policy and procedure
be implemented in a manner that supports a positive school climate, maximizes instructional
time, and increases equitable educational opportunities.
The purposes of this policy and accompanying procedure include:









Engaging with school personnel, students, parents, families, and the community in decisions related to the development and implementation of discipline policies and procedures.;
Supporting students in meeting behavioral expectations, including providing for early involvement of parents and families.;
Administering discipline in ways that respond to the needs and strengths of students and
keep students in the classroom to the maximum extent possible.;
Providing educational services that students need to complete their education without disruption.;
Facilitating collaboration between school personnel, students, and parents, and families to
support successful reentry into the classroom following a suspension or expulsion.;
Ensuring fairness, equity, and due process in the administration of discipline.;
Implementing culturally responsive discipline that provides every student the opportunity
to achieve personal and academic success.;
Providing a safe environment for all students and for district employees.

Rights and Responsibilities/District Commitment
The Board recognizes the negative and disproportionate impact of exclusionary discipline practices and is committed to:



Identifying and addressing discipline policies and practices that perpetuate educational
opportunity gaps; and
Proactively implementing discipline practices that support students in meeting behavioral
expectations without losing access to instruction.;

The District will observe students’ fundamental rights and will administer discipline in a mannermatter that does not:
Page 1 of 5

Packet page 135 of 139

Policy No. 3241
Students

1. Unloawfully discriminate against a student on the basis of sex, race, creed, religion,
color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity, disability,
or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal.;
2. Deprive a student of the student’s constitutional right to freedom of speech and press, the
constitutional right to peaceably assemble and to petition the government and its representatives for a redress of grievances, the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion and to have the student’s school free from sectarian control or influence, subject to
reasonable limitations upon the time, place, and manner of exercising the right.;
3. Deprive a student of the student’s constitutional right to be secure in the student’s person,
papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.;
4. Unlawfully interfere in a student’s pursuit of an education while in the custody of the
school district; or
5. Deprive a student of the student’s right to an equal educational opportunity, in whole or
in part, by a school district without due process of law.
The District’s student discipline policy and procedure is designed to provide students with a safe,
healthy, and educationally sound environment. Students are expected to be aware of and comply
with this policy and procedure, including behavioral expectations that respect the rights, person,
and property of others. Students are also expected to pursue the required course of studies. Students and staff are expected to work together to develop a positive climate for learning, consistent with Board Policy 3112 – Social Emotional Climate.
Development and review
Accurate and complete reporting of all disciplinary actions, including the associated studentlevel information and, behavioral violations, and other forms of discipline the district considered
or attempted, is essential for effective review of this policy; therefore, the district will ensure
such reporting.
The district will collect data on disciplinary actions administered in each school, as required by
RCW 28A.300.042, and any additional data required under other district policies and procedures.
The District will ensure that school principals confer with certificated building employees at
least annually to develop and/or review the district’sbuilding discipline standards and review the
fidelity of their implementation. of those standards. At each district school, principals and certificated staff will develop written school procedures for administering discipline at their school
with the participation of other school personnel, students, parents, families, and the community.
Each school will:
1. Establish behavioral expectations with students and proactively teach expectations across
various school settings.
2. Develop precise definitions for problem behaviors and behavioral violations to address
differences in perceptions of subjective behaviors and reduce the effect of implicit bias.
Page 2 of 5

Packet page 136 of 139

Policy No. 3241
Students

1. Define the differences between minor and major behavior incidents to clarify the types of
behaviors that may or may not result in classroom exclusion or are severe enough that an
administrator needs to be involved.
2. Identify a continuum of best practices and strategies for classroom-based responses that
building staff should administer before or instead of classroom exclusion to support
students in meeting behavioral expectations.
Schools handbooks, codes of conduct, and building discipline standards must not conflict with
this policy, accompanying procedures, or other Board policies. A school’s building discipline
standards must be annually approved by the Superintendent or designee.
School principals will ensure teachers and other school personnel receive adequate support to effectively implement a continuum of identified best practices and strategies that:
1. Focus on prevention to reduce the use of exclusionary discipline practices;
2. Allow the exercise of professional judgment and skill sets; and
3. May be adapted to individual student needs in a culturally responsive manner.
School principals will confer with certificated building employees at least annually to establish
criteria for when certificated employees must complete classes to improve classroom management skills.
The District will periodically review and further develop this policy and procedure with the participation of school personnel, students, parents, families, and the community. As part of this development and review process, the district will use disaggregated data collected under RCW
28A.300.042 to monitor the impact of student discipline practices as well as to improve fairness
and equity in the administration of student discipline. Discipline data must be disaggregated by:
1. School.
2. Student groups, including by gender, grade level, race/ethnicity (including further disaggregation of federal race and ethnicity categories in accordance with RCW
28A.300.042(1) and CEDARS Appendices Y and Z), low-income, English language
learner, migrant, special education, Section 504, foster care, and homeless.
1.3.Behavioral violation.
2.4.Discipline types, including classroom exclusion, in-school suspension, short-term suspension, long-term suspension, emergency removal, and expulsion.
The District will follow the practices outlined in guidance from the Race and Ethnicity Student
Data Task Force when disaggregating broader racial categories into subracial and subethnic categories. The District will consider student program status and demographic information (i.e.,. gender, grade-level, low-income, English language learner, migrant, special education, Section 504,
foster care, and homeless) when disaggregating student race and ethnicity data to identify any
within-group variation in school discipline experiences and outcomes of diverse student groups.
This process may include reviewing data to prevent and address discrimination against students
in protected classes identified in chapters 28A.640 and 28A.642 RCW, however, the District will
ensure it reviews disaggregated discipline data in accordance with WAC 392-190-048 at least
annually.
Page 3 of 5

Packet page 137 of 139

Policy No. 3241
Students

The District will support each school to:
 set at least one goal annually for improving equitable student outcomes;
 create an actions plan or plans;
 evaluate previous goals and action plans; and
 revise goals and action plans, based on evaluations.
Schools will share identified goals and action plans with all staff, students, parents, families, and
the community.
Distribution of policies and procedures

the community. The District will annually provide this policy and procedure to all District personnel, students, parents, and families, which may require language assistance for students and
parents with limited-English proficiency under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The District will ensure district employees and contractors are knowledgeable of this student
discipline policy and procedure.
At the building level, schools will annually provide the current building discipline standards,
developed as stated above, to all school personnel, students, parents, and families, which may
require language assistance for students and parents with limited-English proficiency under Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Schools will ensure all school personnel are knowledgeable
of the school building discipline standards. Schools are encouraged to provide discipline training
developed under RCW 28A.415.410 to support implementation of this policy and procedure to
all school staff as feasible.
