Board/Superintendent Relations (BSR) Policy Review
In keeping with Policy Governance, the Board reviewed the following



BSR-1: Board/Superintendent Connection



outlined in BSR-5, Item No. 4. Dr. Smith and Ms. Bashaw will review this item as
part of their work on the Policy Governance Enhancement Committee.
BSR-5, No. 3, requires the following change:
In every case, the standard for compliance shall be whether the
Superintendent has reasonably interpreted the Board policy being
monitored. The Board will make the final decision as to whether a
Superintendent interpretation is reasonable, and will provide to the
Superintendent, by the next meeting, a monitoring response document
(B/SR-5-E-1 or B/SR-5-E-2). BSR-5.1.1 and BSR-5.1.2. The President will
gather individual board member input and will draft a board response
document for consideration/approval at the next meeting.

Dr. Gass made a motion, seconded by Ms. Bashaw, to amend BSR-5 to reflect the
change referenced above. Motion carried unanimously.
In other Policy Governance matters, the board agreed that at a future date it would
consider revising GP-8, Board Members’ Code of Conduct, to add more detail regarding
methods of communication and response time. It was further agreed that at the next
regular board meeting, GP-8 as currently written would be signed by each board member.

4.1

BOARD RESPONSE TO MONITORING
Board Response to Monitoring EL-3, Treatment and Communication with Public,
Parents, and Students.
Dr. Smith noted that the policy states in part “…provide public, parents, and students
relevant information on student progress toward achieving Board Ends policies.” He said
this is not addressed in the report, nor is the district meeting our goal of providing
information to the community on the progress of meeting our ends. He added that the
complications in explaining this to the broader public, however, may hamper the district’s
progress in this regard.
Following further discussion, Dr. Stockburger made a motion, seconded by Dr. Gass, to
approve the report as presented and to confirm that the Superintendent is in compliance
with Executive Limitation 3. The motion carried unanimously. Board members were also
in agreement that the policy itself should not be amended.

Council member Roxanne Murphy, who serves as council liaison to the district.
Ms. Bashaw also participated in a breakfast meeting with Dr. Baker and Dr.
Smith.

6. NEW BUSINESS
 The Washington State School Directors’ Association (WSDDA) Spring Regional
Meeting takes place April 30 at Lake Stevens.
 The next School Board Linkage will be in late March (date TBD) with local
senior citizens. Presently a breakfast or luncheon meeting is planned.
 Dr. Smith said the School Board is considering submission of an application to
WSDDA for the 2013 Board of Distinction award.
 Dr. Smith said at a future meeting, he will propose that the board consider
establishing compensation for future-elected board members. Consideration of
board compensation would be a formal and transparent process, he said, involving
readings before final approval. He noted that several school districts have this in
place. The compensation typically involves an amount per meeting and could help
support future board members with commitments such as childcare, for example,
to attend meetings.
7. CLOSING ITEMS
7.1 Board Assessment of Meeting
 Dr. Gass assessed the meeting with an overall rating of 5 (good).
8. STUDY SESSION
8.1 Early Childhood Education
At 6:30 p.m. Dr. Smith convened the study session on early childhood education.
Dr. Baker discussed plans for the district’s early entrance Promise Kindergarten Program
(Promise K). He summarized the district’s progress in early childhood education in recent years,
much of which he said is attributable to the work of Department of Teaching and Learning
Director Trina Hall and Early Childhood Education Coordinator Kristi Dominguez.
Kristi Dominguez acknowledged early childhood education staff members who were in the
audience. She then shared a presentation (attached) with the Board. Following her presentation,
Board members had the opportunity to ask questions and visit classrooms to learn more about the
district’s GRADS (Graduation, Reality and Dual-Role Skills parenting program), preschool, and
kindergarten programs. Following classroom visits, Board members and Dr. Baker expressed
appreciation to staff for their participation in this evening’s meeting.
At 7:57 p.m. the study session ended.
9. ADJOURNMENT
Dr. Smith adjourned the meeting at 8:02 p.m.
