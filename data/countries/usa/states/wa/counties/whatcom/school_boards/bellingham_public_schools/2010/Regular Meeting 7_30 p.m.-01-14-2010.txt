I recommend approval of this trip in concept as outlined in the attached information.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To: Doug Kyles, Executive Director for School Administration
From: Deirdre ONeill, Principal of Fairhaven Middle School
Date: January 5, 2010
RE: Student Trip for Fairhaven 8th Graders
I am writing to request approval for a three-day, two-night field trip to Camp Orkila on Orcas Island, April
21-23, 2010 for our 8th grade North Continental Divide team. Camp Orkila has been serving schools as a
site for environmental education since 1971.
Through this experience, students will broaden their understanding of the Puget Sound ecosystem
through hands-on, field-based investigations in both life and earth science. Students will also have the
opportunity to develop their social and personal skills as they work through challenging classes that
address human interactions, communication, team building and adventure. Camp Orkila will provide an
opportunity for students to apply the knowledge and skills they have gained in our classes to a real-world
situation. Following is a brief description of the curricular connections for each of our classes.
ITINERARY AND LEARNING ACTIITIES:
By the time that students attend Camp Orkila, they will have nearly studied the complete cycle of science
curriculum at Fairhaven Middle School. Camp Orkila will allow them to apply their science learning to the
outdoor classroom and extend it beyond the Fairhaven Middle School science curriculum. At Camp
Orkila, science classes will include Birds of the San Juan Islands, Natural History of the San Juan Islands
and Geology. Students will also engage, interact, and explore the wilderness through the manifestations
of language specifically, descriptively, and reflectively.
TRANSPORTATION:
On April 21, students of the North Continental Divide team will depart from Fairhaven at 8:00 am and
travel to the ferry terminal at Anacortes. Students will travel by ferry to Orcas Island where transportation
to Camp Orkila will be provided by the camp facility. Students will return to the ferry terminal in Anacortes
on Friday April 23, and will return to Fairhaven at approximately 4:30 p.m. We will be using the services
of the Bellingham School District to meet our transportation needs. Three school busses will carry
students, chaperones and teachers to Anacortes. The approximate transportation cost is $1200. The

fundraising plan below describes how we plan to raise funds to pay for our transportation.
FUNDRAISING:
The total fee for YMCA Camp Orkila, including transportation, is $141 per student. We are asking families
to pay for the cost. If they are unable to cover the entire cost, we are asking that they contribute whatever
they can and the remainder will be covered through scholarships or fundraising. We are also asking
families to contribute additional funds for scholarships if they are able and willing to do so. In order to
raise funds for our fees, we have several parents who are willing to write grants and research fundraising
options. These parents are especially interested in seeking community support for our trip. Recently,
Kerry Sloan wrote a grant to the Target Grant Foundation requesting funding for Camp Orkila. We are
awaiting notification.
HOUSING:
Camp Orkila cabins are open-air wooden structures that have canvas window coverings, open
doorframes and no electricity. The rustic cabins and philosophy of roughing it have been a tradition at
Orkila since 1906. Cabins sleep 10-12 and all cabins will be chaperoned by one or two teachers and/or
parents.
SUPERVISION:
Chaperones will always be working with either a teacher from FMS or an instructor from Camp Orkila.
Their duties will include participating in hikes, activities, and lessons as well as monitoring student
behavior during meals and in the cabin. Male chaperones will be in the boys cabin and female
chaperones will be in the girls cabin. Orientation and written expectations will be provided for each
chaperone.

RE: Vancouver Science Trip 2010
Eighth grade science teacher, Shannon Flory, would like to take a group of approximately 30 students to
Vancouver, B.C., June 3 through June 5, 2010, .to visit a variety of science-oriented sites. There would
be at least three adult chaperones attending with the 30 students.
On the trip, students will participate in science-oriented activities at Science World, the Vancouver
Aquarium, Capilano Suspension Bridge, University of British Columbia, Grouse Mountain, and the
MacMillan Space Centre.
Students will pay approximately $475 each for the transportation, hotel, meals and activity costs. All
students will be eligible to help fundraise to pay for their trip, though any student unable to pay privately
or fundraise due to personal circumstances or other hardship, can apply for a scholarship.
The trip offers students a science experience that is not possible in the classroom or through local field
trips. The sights visited integrate with the existing curricula in a very direct way. All areas of science study
in 7th and 8th grades are well supported by this trip.
I support Ms. Florys request to facilitate this student trip. I believe Shuksan Middle School students will
benefit from the activities Ms. Flory has tentatively planned. With more than 57% of our students
receiving free or reduced lunch, I am convinced that a rare few have had this type of opportunity.

Recommendation: The Acting Superintendent recommends approval.
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Business and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
The 2009 legislature appropriated $16.9 million to implement energy efficiency projects in K-12 public
schools through a competitive grant process. This grant is designed to help K-12 districts improve their
energy efficiency through small and large construction projects.
Brett Greenwood and Mike Anderson identified several projects and submitted the corresponding
$400,000 grant application. On January 5, 2010, we were notified by OSPI that our grant request was
approved.
Projects are planned for Squalicum, Kulshan, Geneva, and Carl Cozier. All four schools will receive
lighting upgrades, DDC controls will be installed at Kulshan and Geneva, and Carl Cozier will receive a
water fixture upgrade. These projects will help us further reduce our use of resources and their related
costs.

I recommend the Board adopt Resolution No. 2-10 so the district can proceed with implementation of this
grant.
