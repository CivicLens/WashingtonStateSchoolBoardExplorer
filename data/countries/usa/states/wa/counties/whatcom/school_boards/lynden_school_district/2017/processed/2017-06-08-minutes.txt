A group of Lynden Middle School students attended WE Day at the Key Arena. WE Day is a celebration of
youth making a difference in their communities. After attending WE Day, the students were so inspired to
make a difference at school that they began to plan their own event at school to help promote a positive
and caring environment at LMS. They are calling it WE Care week. They will be facilitating all students to
participate in acts of kindness and spreading the message that together we can make a difference.
Lynden High School students who attend a class at the Technic Training Center assembled the last
bookshelf, #250, that will be used in the new Fisher Elementary. There is talk of having the same project
done for the new middle school.
Congratulations to LMS Art Teacher, Cindy Bell! Cindy was awarded the Educator of the Year presented
