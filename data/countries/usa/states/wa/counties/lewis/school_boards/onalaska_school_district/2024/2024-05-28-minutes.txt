    5. Student Rep Reports
  Reports: 5.1 Student Rep Report - David Locklin
This was David's last meeting with us for this school year. He reported on how the students are very ready for school to be over, especially the seniors. Track did great at State; earned lots of medals. He's really glad Coach Hoppie is still going to continue with the program. Next year is going to have a lot of changes with new staff coming on; they have big shoes to fill. He hopes next years student rep will be even better than himself.
David's plans for the future include joining the Army Reserves. He will do basic training at Ft. Sill, OK and AIT in Georgia. He will be stationed at JBLM.
  6. REPORTS BY ADMINISTARTORS
Superintendent Padgett spoke on the recent split from the Sped Coop at ESD and the start of the new Small Schools coop.

They are doing a great job and the school looks amazing.
