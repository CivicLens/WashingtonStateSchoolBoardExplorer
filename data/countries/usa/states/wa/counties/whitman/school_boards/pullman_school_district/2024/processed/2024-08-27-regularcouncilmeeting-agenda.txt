Public Content
Each year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) collaborate to formally recognize Local Agency projects that
have achieved excellence in innovative, practical design and construction, environmental
sustainability, and community engagement.From the many qualified projects that were submitted
for 2023, the City of Pullman received the2023 Excellence Award for the Best City Project for the
Arterial Streets Resurfacing 2020 project. The announcement of this award was included in
WSDOT'sSpring 2024 Newsletter(see Page 10).
The following representatives of WSDOT and FHWA will formally present this award to the City:

Ralph Rizzo, FHWA Washington Division Administrator
Jay Drye, P.E., WSDOT Director of Local Programs
Mark Allen, P.E., WSDOT Easter Regional Local Programs Engineer
The Arterial Streets Resurfacing 2020 project successfully resurfaced 1.3 miles of heavily
deteriorated urban arterial streets on Pioneer Hill in Pullman, Washington, by utilizing a grindand-mix approach that allowed for an efficient construction timeline and minimized necessary
materials removal and procurement and use. The $1.8M project also included several safety
considerations and enhancements along the targeted arterial route, which is primarily through
residential areas, including school routes/zones, with a portion also traversed by Pullman
Transit. A total of 65 curb ramps were constructed within the project limits to ADA standards (19
existing, 46 brand-new), with three traffic calming areas incorporated into the design to help slow
traffic and promote safer navigation by and visibility of pedestrians along this key route.
