Student Enrollment: 353.84 FTE
●

On May 3rd, CHS and CJHS Band and Choir performed for our students. It was a beautiful day and they
sounded amazing.

●

Fort Colville celebrated our staff the week of May 6th with lots of goodies. Thank you, board members, for
the sandwiches.

●

Move-Up Days: This year’s 2nd graders will come visit Fort Colville on Thursday, May 30th, and meet our
staff. Our 5th graders will walk to the Junior High on Tuesday, June 11th, for Move-Up Day. They will take
a tour of the school and have an opportunity to ask questions of staff and students about life at the Junior
High.

●

Special Services Transitions: In an effort to help 2 nd graders transition to Fort Colville smoothly, students in
BI/DI programs visit as a small group to get a tour of the building and meet teachers, secretaries, and the
nurse. They also eat lunch and play on the playground. A similar experience occurs with 5 th grade BI/DI
students visiting the Junior High.

●

All students participated in SBA. 3rd, 4th and 5th grade tested in ELA and Math. 5th grade also tested in
Science (WCAS). In addition to the SBA, all students will be taking their last Star Assessment for this school
year. These assessments help us identify areas we can celebrate and areas we need to focus on as a school.
We also celebrate student growth throughout the year.

●

We are currently recruiting students for our Summer Reading Clinic. Reading proficiency is the sole focus
of Fort Colville’s summer session. This reading clinic will be by invitation only. Students will be scheduled
into 55-minute tutoring sessions. Each session will serve up to 10 students for a cap of 40 students served
per day. Student learning will be individualized based on the STAR assessment, Read Well assessments,
third-quarter assessments, and year-end reading assessment.

●

Fort Colville students will be having the Fun Run on Wednesday, June 12th. The top 3 finishers from each
grade level will receive an award. Fort Colville’s Field Day for students will be held on Thursday, June
13th.

●

This year we have had a number of situations where staff were absent and we did not have coverage. To
date:
○

Custodial has 16.5 days with no sub available - Adam usually adjusts his schedule to work the day
shift plus a couple of hours - net loss of 6 hours custodial time each occurrence.

○

Teacher subs have not been available for 12 full days, four ½ day PM, and three ½ day AM jobs.
We cover with one of our specialists so students don’t get PE, Library, Tech or Music and
classroom teachers lose their prep (which is an added cost to the district).

○

There have been 71 instances where a para sub has not been available (some days required more
than one sub). We cover as best we can, but often intervention groups get canceled.

●

Thank you, School Board members, for your continued support.

April Recognition Update!
○

CJHS still has 3 students with perfect attendance! We are proud of Donald Lenhard, Jaden
Lenhard, and Jaycee Zhu for their commitment to their attendance this school year. They are very
much focused on finishing the year with a full 180 days of school! Mr. Dan Jackson continues to
represent the CJHS staff with his perfect attendance.

miss one day of school during the month. Way to go to all those students and staff who are
committed to finishing strong!

○

traits and continuing to SOAR at CJHS.

Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA)
○

Students have dove into state testing this month and are working extremely hard to show their
learning. We have set up a friendly testing schedule that allows the students plenty of time to take
their time during the assessment and give their best effort.

●

CJHS Athletics Update
○

Our Baseball team has 3 different teams, 1 varsity team and 2 JV teams. All three teams are
competing competitively within the league and representing Colville School District respectively. I
have had the opportunity to umpire a few games and can say that I am proud of our student
athletes' sportsmanship, attitudes, and effort as they compete.

○

The CJHS track and field team are making their final push to qualify for the league championships.
We have a high number of student athletes that have qualified for the championship along with
some new school records. The future of our track and field program looks very promising as our
students continue to push for personal records entering the championship meet!

●

May Safety Drill
○

This month we will be engaging in an off-site evacuation drill. During this drill students and staff
will evacuate the building to their designated areas and take attendance. After attendance is taken
and students are accounted for, we will transition to the Colville Community Church parking lot
across from the community college. Students and staff will be informed of the drill procedures
beforehand to allow learning and understanding of the drill procedure.

●

Junior Lilac Parade and Spring Concert
○

Our CJHS band classes attended the Junior Lilac Parade on May 11th. The band students
represented well and were provided great feedback from the judges. The students loved the
experience of getting to observe the bigger schools bands, along with the schools that were similar
in size. Students gained a lot of confidence because of the experience and look forward to
improving on the feedback they received. The marching band will be putting on a performance for
their families and the community on May 20th at the HS at 5:30pm.

Facilities
On Saturday April 27th several members of the Maintenance crew picked up and delivered approximately 150 yards
of bark from Vaagen’s. The following week was spent placing and spreading bark in all necessary locations, along
with grounds/irrigation work. Thank You Vaagen’s!
Vaagen’s has donated manpower and equipment to put in two new baseball fields at the Fort. As of now, the east
field is playable and they continue to work toward getting both fields up and running. Thanks again Vaagen’s!
We are constructing two new walls in the DI BI area at Hofstetter. The new walls will help contain noise and the
occasional student if they have the tendency to run.
As I am writing this report, part of the crew is removing the water heater that serves the locker rooms at CHS. The
water heater failed last night with no damage from flooding. We will order the new water heater and install it as
soon as it arrives.
We have a new javelin runway being worked on at CHS and will be finished in time to be surfaced with the new
track.
Thank you to the Maintenance crew and everyone else for all of the hard work. If anyone has any questions or
concerns, please feel free to reach out.
Nutrition
We received an update for our walk-ins for Fort Colville and Hofstetter at the beginning of the month. They are on
time with production and our expected delivery week is still July 8th.

Our Summer Grab and Go meal boxes have over 200 kids already signed up to receive the biweekly meal box,
exceeding our expectation. DSHS, Statesman Examiner, and neighboring school districts reached out for more
information so they can share our meal opportunities with more of the community. Priority registration is May 24th.
We are recipe testing sourdough bread and pizza crust at the Junior High kitchen to expand our scratch made menu
items for the 2024-2025 school year.
The new USDA nutrition standards were published this month. These new standards are bringing some exciting
changes to our menus for next year, including protein being a requirement for breakfast (which currently it is not).
May 22, 2024

Page 2363

We are not concerned with the limiting added sugars or sodium requirements that came out with these standards
since we are focusing more each year on scratch cooking. Our district is actually already meeting the sodium
requirements we will be seeing in the coming years.
Overall, our kitchen staff are working hard to finish the year strong and willing to step up in positions when needed
to keep our kitchens running and provide quality meals to our students.

community involvement and who do so with grace overcoming their own disabilities. Her first trip to meet with her
cohort peers was May 17-19 in Tacoma.
The CHS marching band traveled to the Torchlight Parade in Spokane on May 18. The CHS and JHS marching bands

signed up.
