The Mercer Island School District Board of Directors held a special meeting on October 11, 2024, to discuss Board Policy 1800 OE-1 regarding personalized learning and instructional practices. Superintendent Fred Rundle introduced Dr. Ray Smith, who discussed high-impact teaching practices and the importance of collaboration among educators to improve student outcomes. The Board considered revising the policy language to focus more broadly on "learning" instead of just "personalized learning," emphasizing the need to define the "why," "how," and "what" of the policy. Metrics for measuring progress were also discussed. In the afternoon, the Board reviewed iReady Math, an adaptive assessment tool presented by representatives from Curriculum Associates. They explored its role in informing instruction and measuring student growth, highlighting the necessity of using multiple data sources for a comprehensive understanding of student learning. The discussions reflect the district's commitment to enhancing academic standards and transparency in curriculum and assessment practices.
