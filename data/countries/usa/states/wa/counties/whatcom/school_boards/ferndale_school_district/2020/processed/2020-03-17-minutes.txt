3. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
Information: 3.01 Information About How the District is Responding to
COVID-19
Dr. Quinn provided an update to board members about the COVID-19
situation and how the district is responding to it.
Since Sunday, Dr. Quinn has sent daily updates to board members, staff
and families. She said the district learned Friday that schools needed to be
closed by midnight on Monday for approximately six weeks. Governor
Inslee has given district’s four priorities to work on during this time:
providing nutrition service, providing childcare services, providing
meaningful work for all employee groups and providing learning work
for students.
Dr. Quinn said the district met this morning with leadership of all unions
to discuss how to move forward with the governor’s priorities. It was a
very positive meeting. Unions weighed in on where they could offer

support. Following that meeting, district administrators met and created a
plan to put in place for the week. Five work groups have been established
to work on each of the priorities and one group to work on
communications.
Dr. Quinn reported that child nutrition services would begin on Friday of
this week. There will be meal delivery and well as drop off/pick up at
several school locations on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. More
details will be forthcoming tomorrow.
In the area of childcare, Dr. Quinn said the district is administering a
survey to find out the needs of the community. She will provide an
update to the board next Monday.
Dr. Quinn added she is collecting questions and considering ways for
district employees to work. She said community service is legitimate
work, as stated by the governor. Custodial staff may be doing “summer
work” during this time. And, the FAAA group has said it can use this
time to get things done that are not always at the top of the list.
The schedule for this week includes shutting down facilities for the most
part through Friday. Dr. Quinn said this is one way to help them get
cleaned out. She said the virus doesn’t live for long on surfaces.
Exceptions to this are food service workers in four schools, some
teamsters and custodial people to support nutrition, and essential services
in the district office. The district is closed to staff and members of the
public.
Virtual administrator team meetings will be held each day.
Administrators are in contact with their staff members.
Dr. Quinn said Mr. Brittain and Ms. Larrabee have meetings scheduled for
tomorrow with teacher leaders to build an infrastructure on delivering
some sort of learning to students.
4. MATTERS RESERVED FOR BOARD ACTION
Action: 4.01 Consider Whether or Not to Proceed with the April 28 Levy Ballot
Measure
In light of the impacts of COVID-19, board members considered whether
or not to proceed with the April 28 Levy Ballot Measure.
Mr. McLaurin asked Dr. Quinn to share any information received from the
auditor's office. Dr. Quinn said the county auditor and secretary of state
both have urged the district to not run the election in April because their
offices may not be able to staff the election. And communication with the

secretary of state indicated she may cancel the election. Dr. Quinn said it
may come to point where they take the decision out of our hands and
cancel the election.
Mr. McLaurin noted that if the board withdrew the levy measure from the
April ballot and put it on the August ballot, the resolution would be due
to the auditor no later than May 8. Ms. Cool indicated she was in favor of
postponing the ballot measure due to the auditor's recommendation and
the state the community is in right now. She said a lot of people will be in
a financial hardship. People were already saying they could not afford the
$2.50 proposed levy rate. Things might look better in August. Ms.
Deardorff agreed with Ms. Cool. Dr. Erickson added there are a lot of
unknowns right now which could lead to a no vote. Ms. Riddle added she
fears that in another month the situation will be worse. As much as it will
hurt staff, she supports taking the levy measure off the April ballot.
Ms. Deardorff asked what it would look like if people are laid off. Dr.
Quinn said the district is looking at laying off 80-100 people in order to
make the $7.2 million in reductions for next year. If the levy measure is
run in August and it passes, the district can begin adding back programs
and staff.
Mr. McLaurin said the board needs to decide tonight whether it will keep
the ballot measure on the April ballot. It doesn't yet need to decide
whether or not to run it on the August or November ballot.
Dr. Erickson moved to withdraw the board's resolution for placing the
levy ballot measure on the April 28 ballot and reconsider the topic at an
upcoming meeting once the board has additional information about the
current situation. By roll call vote, the motion passed unanimously.
Mr. McLaurin will notify the county auditor of the board's action. An
official document rescinding the ballot measure will be prepared for the
board to consider at its March 31, 2020 business meeting.
Ms. Cool asked that during this time for everyone to be respectful to each
other when talking about this matter—give each other grace. Ms.
Deardorff agreed. Ms. Deardorff thanked Dr. Quinn for all the work she is
doing and making decisions on the moment.
