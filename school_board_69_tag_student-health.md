The Highland School District #203 Board Meeting on April 8, 2024, addressed several key topics, including the adoption of the 2024-2025 Instructional Calendar, which features proposed intersessions in February and May and an extended Thanksgiving break. The board expressed concern over potential absenteeism due to the extended breaks, which they believe may hinder learning. Additionally, the first reading of revised policies was conducted, including Policy 3122 on Excused & Unexcused Absences and Policy 3225 on School-based Threat Assessment. The meeting also highlighted the need for additional health support staff, as the current part-time health room aide position is ESSER funded and will end this school year, indicating a need for ongoing student health services. Finally, the board discussed the elimination of the CTE Business/Marketing position due to budget constraints, reflecting ongoing challenges in staffing and special education support.
