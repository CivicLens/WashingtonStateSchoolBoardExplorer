Public Content
This presentation provides the City Council with an annual update on 2024 Housing
Legislation.
The affordability and availability of housing is a challenge to many residents statewide
as well as those located in Pullman. The State Legislature has identified housing as a
critical need for many communities. This legislative update is intended to highlight
some of the work that is being accomplished in Olympia.
Highlights include:
ESHB 1998 Establishes zoning reform to allow co-living homes, which are small
apartments with shared kitchens.
SB 6015 The first stand-alone parking bill ever passed in Washington that allows
for flexibility in parking zones.
2SHB 2071 A process to modify residential building codes for the construction of
middle housing projects of up to six units.
ESHB 2321 Clarifies requirements for middle housing and residential density as
it relates to transit stops and critical areas.

SSB6059 Manufactured housing communities and revisions for the opportunities
to purchase.
HB 2375 Senior property tax exemption with accessory dwelling units.
HB 1890 Allows cities to have a joint city/county housing authority.
SHB 1892 Creates a revolving loan fund for low-income housing.
ESHB 2003 Creates a leasehold excise tax exemption for public lands for
affordable housing.
SHB 2012 Allows non-profit affordable housing developments to benefit from
property tax exemptions.
Continued in this year's presentation are summaries of bills that are in committees
and those that have not been furthered forward in this session.

M. Public Hearing

Type :

Public Hearing

Public Content
Chapter 251, Laws of 1995, codified as RCW 84.55.120, requires that a public
hearing be conducted on revenue sources for the coming years budget, including the
consideration of possible increases in property tax revenues.
Property tax levies are set on a yearly basis and recorded with the Whitman County
Assessor on or before November 30th of each calendar year as per RCW 84.52.070.
As per the schedule adopted at the City Council Meeting on June 11, 2024, the City
Council is to set the 2024 property tax levies on November 12, 2024.
Additional consideration regarding the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD) is not required for
2025. For cities with over 10,000 population, property taxes can be raised by the
lower of 1% plus new construction or the IPD plus new construction. The date of
record for the IPD is September 25th, annually. The current projected IPD rate is
2.6% and is not anticipated to fall below 1% before the official date of record which
falls after this agenda item is published. As per RCW 84.55.0101, when the IPD falls
below 1%, cities can adopt a resolutionor ordinance of "substantial need" andlevy the
full 1% ifit is documentedthatan increase in costs of services is actually in excess of
the current factor. Based on these conditions, additional consideration regarding a
resolution or ordinance declaring a "substantial need" with respect to the IPD does
not appear to be required for 2025.

Recommended Action :

Staff recommends the adoption of the proposed fee
schedule for land leases as presented.

Public Content
As Project Downtown Pullman nears completion, the City of Pullman will begin accepting
applications beginning on October 1, 2024 for new land leases from businesses on Main Street.
The process for completing these applications remains unchanged and still requires City Council
approval. Any new land leases would be approved by the City Council after October 15, 2024,
and would utilize the new fee schedule. Due to contract restrictions and liabilities issues, any
new land leases on Main Street cannot be effective before Project Downtown Pullman is
completed in full.Fees for future land leases and renewals may be changed by resolution of the
City Council.
The current formula for calculating lease agreement fees is requested square feet multiplied by
$0.50 multiplied by the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) divided by the CPI of June 2014.
The proposed resolution simplifies and streamlines the fee to $250.00 for the initial application
and $200 for each subsequent year the lease is in place. This fee is intended for "sidewalk
cafes" or "sidewalk seating" not to exceed 250 square feet.
An annual lease of $250 or less avoids excise tax on leased public property under RCW 82.29A.
130(8).
By comparison, the City of Spokane requires $300.00 for the initial review of the lease with
$250.00 annually thereafter.

Discussion Items

Public Content
Regulation of vacant commercial spaces in the C-2 Central Business District is a goal
of the City Council. This agenda item was discussed most recently on June 11th and
June 25th City Council agendas on vacant commercial spaces. Video of the June

11th meeting can be located at the 1:35:35 mark located here:2024-06-11 Pullman
City Council Meeting (youtube.com)and for the June 25th meeting at 1:51:48 located
here:2024-06-25 Pullman City Council Meeting - YouTube.
Please see the attached draft ordinance completed by city staff on vacant commercial
spaces as discussed by the City Council. The only consensus on an item to change
from the June 25th Council meeting was in section 17.XX.050(A) from ten (10)
calendar days to ten (10) business days for the registration of a commercial building
in this zone.
Following significant research and drafting efforts, staff remains concerned the draft
ordinance exceeds the City's scope of authority and its vulnerability to legal scrutiny
will eclipse its intended objective. The existing City nuisance provisions address the
vacant building safety and health issues. Additionally, the enforcement-related staff
capacity and budget impacts have not been fully assessed, but are expected to be
significant.
Staff is seeking guidance from the City Council on content and next steps. If the City
Council elects to proceed, the next step would be a public hearing before the
Planning Commission at a regularly scheduled meeting. After the public hearing, the
Planning Commission will adopt its recommendation for the City Council's final
consideration.
