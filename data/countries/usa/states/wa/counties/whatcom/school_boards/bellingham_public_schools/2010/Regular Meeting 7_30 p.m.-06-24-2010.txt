Explanation of Issue: Home Port Learning Center Alternative Learning Experience
We currently have an agreement with Home Port and we want to modify the agreement to include the
capacity to add an Alternative Learning Experience (ALE). We are recommending approval. It is in line
with Board policy and state law. The maximum class size shall not exceed a 24:1 ratio.
------------------------------------

To: Karst Brandsma, Deputy Superintendent
From: Kenn Robinson, Student Services Director
Date: June 16, 2010
Re: Home Port Learning Center Alternative Learning Experience
The Bellingham School District has had a long and successful relationship with Home Port Learning
Center. For the past decade, Home Port has had from twelve to twenty Bellingham students per month
who have found a home for themselves there and have earned high school credit. Increasingly over the
past three to four years, we have increased the number of middle school students attending Home Port.
At this time, Home Port has come to the district with a request to expand their range of services. Under
applicable WACs 392-121-182 and 392-121-188 (Alternative Learning Experiences) and under school
board policy #2245 and 2245P (Contract Learning) Home Port would like to begin to offer credit for
Alternative Learning Experiences (ALE). I met with the staff from Home Port to review the requirements
they and the students would have to satisfy and I am fully comfortable in recommending this action to
you. Their plan to begin ALE is in compliance with state regulations. Just as important, the Home Port
staff is dedicated and ready for this undertaking. Under the WACs, approval for ALE requires school
board action.
The major requirements for an ALE program are:
1. A written student plan describing the body of learning to be undertaken;
2. A schedule of direct contact between the student and teacher(s);
3. An initial estimate of how many hours per week the student will work to
achieve and demonstrate the learning required;
4. A schedule for continuous review of the students progress; to be no less than
once monthly;
5. A description of how the students work will be evaluated and how credit will be
assigned;

6. A beginning and ending date for the experience;
7. A description of the specific learning goals for the experience;
8. A statement that the experience meets state and district graduation
requirements.

A common question about ALE is about funding. How does the district determine the funding allotment
for ALE?
The students FTE is calculated based on the estimated weekly hours in the learning plan. Partial FTE is
determined by the percentage or ratio of hours in the learning plan of a part-time student as compared to
a 1.0 FTE student.

Example: 25 hours a week represents a 1.0 FTE student (Grades 412). A part-time middle school
student Susie Jones enrolls and the estimated hours in her WSLP are 15 hours a week. 15/25 = .6.
Susie would be .6 FTE.
Each year our school board will be required to approve an initial staff to student ratio for ALE programs. I
am requesting approval for a 24:1 ratio. A ratio this high will provide the flexibility we need if the program
really becomes successful.
While Home Port provides an extremely valuable service to students who may not typically be successful
in a mainstream high school, they too have students who may need a softer entry back into a school life.
Home Port hopes that the ability to create an ALE will keep more students in a school program and/or will
attract more students back to schooling.
Ralph Smallwood and Rebekah Keene from Home Port will attend the school board meeting with me on
June 24 to respond to questions.

To: Superintendent Sherrie Brown
From: Tanya Rowe, Director of Communications and Community Relations
Thank you for the opportunity to share an update on our Web-related projects, supported by the
technology levy passed by voters in 2008. This work enhances our communications with students,
parents, staff and community members. It also fosters collaboration for staff and improves public access
to district and school information.
District Web Site: Public
The Bellingham School District launched a content management system and new Web site in January.
We have been very pleased with the flexibility that the new navigation and site provide. This summer, we
will make some minor visual and back-end adjustments to the district Web site, based upon what we
have learned after using the system for the last several months.
Related to our Web work, we are also implementing SchoolMessenger this summer as the districtwide
parent notification system. Principals will be able to use SchoolMessenger beginning in late August to
send general outreach phone calls, text or e-mails (e-blasts) in multiple languages to parents at their
schools, targeted by groups in Zangle such as by grade level. School secretaries at the elementary,
middle and high school levels will use the system for automated attendance notifications. The
Communications and Community Relations office will use the system for emergency notifications and
other districtwide general messaging and surveying. Parents will be able to manage their mobile and email contact information in the systems portal known as ContactManager. Administrators and secretaries
will receive SchoolMessenger training in August.
School Web Sites: Public
We are currently working with Options High School (has no Web site), Lowell Elementary School (has no
current Web site), Happy Valley Elementary School and Shuksan Middle School on new school Web
sites, which will be on our content management system platform. The launch of these sites this summer
will be followed by Northern Heights, then Larrabee and Squalicum in early fall. This order was
determined with input from principals who were ready to work with us on new sites. The rest of the
schools will follow in the fall and during the 2010-11 school year. Teachers will have Web pages as part
of their new school Web site this will be a public space for sharing information about courses, etc.
Staff Intranet: Private (not accessible to the public)
Many technology teacher leaders, library media specialists, principals and school/district staff met with
our K-12 technology expert/consultant, Clarity Innovations, earlier this school year to help build user
scenarios for a staff intranet and provide input to create the criteria needed to select an Intranet platform
for districtwide use. Clarity used these scenarios and input to thoroughly re-evaluate Intranet systems for
our district and recommended SharePoint 2010 because it has the ability to meet our needs. We have
accepted this recommendation and are preparing to work with a developer on our SharePoint 2010 site.

Our goal is to begin work with a SharePoint 2010 developer and the Curriculum Department in early July
to have the following features ready by early August:
Accessing an easy-to-use interface, available to all district staff through any Internet browser
Sharing instructional resources in the areas of curriculum, assessment and instructional technology
Sharing other district documents and manuals for staff
Managing users, groups, access and permissions

In early fall, we will plan to add features for:
Collaborating with colleagues
Participating in committees and workgroups
Keeping up with news from across the district
Specifying communication preferences

We will use a staged approach for adding features based on user scenarios to our SharePoint 2010 site
with a focus on providing professional development and training to support staff in using these technology
tools. We will work with our two schools in August who have been piloting SharePoint 2007 to move to
the new site.
Learning Management System: Private (not accessible to the public)
We recognize that this is also a high needs area space for students and staff to work collaboratively in a
protected instructional space. This part of our Web strategy has been designated for future work,
following the launch of the three foundational building blocks outlined above.
It is important to note that while these projects are outlined separately, they overlap in many ways.
Therefore, we are approaching this work through a coordinated Web strategy to help ensure that the
systems are compatible and integrated.

Explanation of Issue: Student Athletics and Activities Pay Schedule
Each year the high school athletics/activities coordinators and ASB bookkeepers review the list of ASB
student activities pay rates to ensure the rate structure complies with the necessary minimum wage law

and the needs of the programs it supports.
Changes have been recommended regarding the fee structure for middle school and high school
athletics. These modifications were included in a report to the Board in April 2010. I recommend that the
Board of Directors approve the following modifications to the fees schedule:
To take effect at the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year:
a. Adjust the Athletic Fees Per Sport at the high schools and charge $110, plus a $35 ASB fee for
the first sport for full cost lunch students and a $35 ASB fee for a 2nd and 3rd sport. Reduced cost
and free lunch students will pay $20, plus a $15 ASB fee for the first sport and a $15 ASB fee for a
2nd or 3rd sport. (Saul Haas funds can be accessed for students who cannot pay all or part of the
reduced cost).
b. Adjust the Athletic Fees Per Sport at the middle schools. Charge $100 for each sport for full cost
lunch students. Charge $65 for each sport for reduced cost lunch students. Charge $35 for each
sport for free lunch students. (Saul Haas funds can be accessed for students who cannot pay for all
or part of the participation fee).
c. A one-time middle school $10 ASB fee will also be required for participation in an ASB
sponsored sport or activity.
