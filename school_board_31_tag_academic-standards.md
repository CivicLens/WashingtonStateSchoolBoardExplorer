## 2024-04-23 - CHIMACUM_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The meeting on April 23, 2024, focused on the adoption of Health, Human Growth and Development (HG&D), and English Language Arts (ELA) curricula. The transition from FLASH to PTWY for elementary health education was discussed, with Reina Garcia highlighting that FLASH was not suitable for secondary education and that PTWY offers tailored content for each grade level. State requirements mandate HIV education starting in 5th grade, with 8.5 hours allocated for 5th and 6th grades. The HG&D curriculum was adopted unanimously (4-0). 

In the ELA presentations, Leigh Schwartz reported on the history of the ELA adoption process, noting that the Wit and Wisdom curriculum was piloted but ultimately rejected. The team explored five additional curricula, with CKLA favored by primary educators and Wonders preferred by grades 3-6. Concerns were raised about special education support in the Wonders curriculum, with Josette Mendoza pointing out that it facilitated the completion of 2.5 essays versus simple paragraphs. The committee's discussions emphasized the need for curriculum transparency and the importance of foundational skills and trade books in ELA instruction.
