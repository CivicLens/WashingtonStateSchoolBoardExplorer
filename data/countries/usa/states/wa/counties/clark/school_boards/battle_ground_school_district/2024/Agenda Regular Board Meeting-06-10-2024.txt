Background:
Per Policy 2320, student travel requests require board approval if they are overnight trips. Advisors are required to submit all required

traveling with chaperones.
Exceptions to the rule are travel requests for state and national tournaments and competitions. The procedures for these types of trips is

the trip. In this case, advisors must submit all paperwork to the Risk Management Officer prior to the trip for approval. The trip is then ratified
by board members at their next regularly scheduled board meeting.
Student travel requests are attached.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors approve the intent to award the
District Food Service Management bid to Chartwells for the
2024-2025 school year, with the option to renew for four
consecutive one year terms.

Public Content
Background:
Per previous Board authorization, Request for Proposals (RFP) for Food Service Management Services was advertised on March 29th, April
2nd, 5th, and 9th, 2024. Multiple organizations were targeted via market research; six organizations requested bid packets. In addition, a prebid conference followed by site visit tours was held on April 10, 2024. Ultimately, two proposals were received from Chartwells and Sodexo.
The district publicly opened those responses to the RFP on April 30, 2024.

A committee consisting of CFO Michelle Scott, District Administrators Travis Drake and Mike Michaud, Purchasing Agent Darcy Spiekerman,
and Ms. Lindsay Hansen, patron and parent of a district student, reviewed the bids based on the criteria outlined in the RFP. The combined
average score of all committee members is attached. Chartwells score is 86.8 points out of 100 total points available. Sodexos score is 83.0
points out of 100 total points available. The proposal with the highest score is awarded the bid.
This was a very competitive bid process. Chartwells' proposal offered the lowest fixed price per meal, a key evaluation factor in determining
the best interest of the district and nutrition services program.
The award of this bid commences a period of contract negotiation. The resulting contract will first be subject to legal review and then OSPI
approval. It is anticipated to be available for final Board approval at the June 24th board meeting.

The District thanks Sodexo for its many years of service to Battle Ground Public Schools students and staff and its commitment to providing
high-quality, nutritious meals. James and his staff are to be commended for their many contributions to BGPS nutrition services, especially
during the pandemic.
