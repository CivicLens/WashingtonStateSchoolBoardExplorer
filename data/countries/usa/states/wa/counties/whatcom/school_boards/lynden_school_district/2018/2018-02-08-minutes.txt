Lynden High School received the results of the Avant Assessment for World Language Proficiency. We
have 20 students who earned a total of 65 college credits for their achievement of the STAMP test! We
now have a total of 4 students who will earn the Seal of Biliteracy at graduation. The STAMP test assesses
reading, writing, listening and speaking in a student's native language.
Lynden High School Teacher, Jody Bogues is doing some amazing things with her new entrepreneur class.
She has developed her own product, opened an etsy store, and started marketing it to show her students
how the process works and go through the process as she is teaching them. Her students have to come up
with a product or service, develop a business plan, and figure out how to market. Two of her students have
created small businesses that they will implement moving forward.
Lynden High School is taking 60 students to the Whatcom Business Alliance Youth Engagement kick-off
at BTC Students will participate in discussions with four local business leaders who will intorduce the

Lynden Academy is proud of one of their students who came back to school for one class to graduate! She
has a graduation certificate and is ready to go.
After doing a "No Late Homework Month", Lynden Academy is excited to report that over 60% of students
7th-12th grade were able to get their homework in on time. The students didn't realize that Dairy Queen
donated free blizzards to the school for this incentive and 47 students received these certificates at the end
of the semester!
All winter sports teams and cheerleaders served lunch to the elementary kids. It was a big hit!
Food service passed the federal audit with no findings!
