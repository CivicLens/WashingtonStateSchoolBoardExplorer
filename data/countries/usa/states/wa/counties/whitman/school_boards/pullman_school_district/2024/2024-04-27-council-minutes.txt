A. Call to Order
Action, Motion: 1. Roll Call
B. Discussion
Mayor Benjamin explained the process for goal setting. These are two-year goals that
are described for planning. Our current goals and priorities combine short-, medium-,
and long-term items that the City Council has determined to be focus areas for the city,
personnel, and community partners.
These goals and priorities are used during the city budget process to shape priority
funding. These goals help direct staff where they should focus their staff time. These are
the City of Pullman’s goals as the governmental body, not community goals. When
adopting goals, we ask if it is in the city’s purview or if another entity would better present
that goal.
Community members submitted 33 goals to the city’s website, 100 were recommended
at the Council open house, and staff recommended 58 goals.
Mayor Benjamin explained that once the Council had completed its list of goals, it would
select three to five top priorities, create workgroups, and provide recommendations to the
Council.
Mayor Benjamin and the Council reviewed the 2022- 2023 goals and priorities and
determined which goals were completed and which goals are ongoing maintenance.
The City Council discussed which goals they would like staff to continue to work on from
the adopted goals for 2022-2023.
The City Council agreed to have a special meeting on May 7, 2024, to complete their
2024-2025 goals and priorities.
C. Adjournment
The meeting adjourned at noon.
