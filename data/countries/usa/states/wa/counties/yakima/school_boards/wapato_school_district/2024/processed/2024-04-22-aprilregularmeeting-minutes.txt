move forward with a progressive design build model. Mr. Garza explained how this model was chosen,
how it avoids change orders that will allow for ease of phasing and quicker build. This process puts the
liability on the construction and architect to meet the District’s needs. He said this is a modern method
of newly constructed schools and the District can change the model for each project. Mr. Hill explained
the difference between a traditional build such as Simcoe Elementary and the progressive build model
process that allows the project to stay within budget. He explained the D-Forms process and deadlines

model design build and move onto selecting an architect and construction company in June to work with

change orders. The Board engaged in discussion regarding the role of OAC construction management

will work directly and closely with the architect and construction company as a team to deliver and meet
the District needs with in the agreed upon budget. He provided detailed information and examples of
the process and reported the progressive design model has been successful in other school construction
throughout the state.
