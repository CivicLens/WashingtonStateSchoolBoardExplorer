Dr. Mike Copland, Deputy Superintendent, and Brian Rick, Director of Research and

discussed whether the superintendent is in compliance with the policy and whether it
needs to be revised. (See Attachment A for compilation of responses to the monitoring
report.)
Following discussion, Ms. Peterson made a motion, seconded by Mr. Benjamin, to
change Item 2.c of the policy as follows. Unanimous affirmative vote.
 2.c: {The superintendent shall not fail to:} prepare a three-year four-year
forward-looking budget for building organizational capacity to achieve board
ends in future years; and

3.3

Review and discuss possible revisions to GPS 1-6:
Governance Process Policies GP-1 through GP-6 are reviewed annually in January.
Throughout the spring of 2017, as part of a broad sub-committee review, these policies
were revised and in some cases re-numbered. They are included in this agenda primarily
for informational purposes and to adhere to the schedule outlined in the annual board
agenda (GP-7.2)
The board members acknowledged the work of former board member Dr. Steve Smith in
working on these policy revisions. It was agreed that no further revisions are needed at
this time, but these should be reviewed at a future date in conjunction with review of the
Board Handbook to ensure alignment.

The district’s continued close work with community partners.
Ongoing communication with our stakeholders regarding district initiatives, such as 1:1
technology, the 4x8 high school schedule, and changes to elementary and high school start
and end times.
Clear evidence of comprehensive involvement of stakeholders and other community partners
in both planning and funding. Shows community involvement. Similar with intra-district
involvement.
The successive string of clean audits (12 years in a row) is impressive and reassuring.
It should be noted that this reporting period particularly was impacted by substantial changes
at the state level (EHB 2242), making the associated tasks especially difficult. Well done.
The district clearly and effectively communicated budget updates and challenges during an
uncertain legislative session.
Excellent progress in securing diverse district resources, including through awarded grants
that promote equity and access.
The italicized comments were a great addition to the report.
The decision to purchase new school buses was one of the best decisions made recently.
Continued work in developing and expanding community partnerships is commendable.
The addition of multi-year projections and commentary specific to building future capacity
are appreciated.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
 It would be helpful to see how grants aligned with specific ends.
 The board looks forward to an update on how the district is implementing Government
Finance Officers Assoc. (GFOA) Best Practices guidelines in the future, and feedback to the
board if the Bellingham Promise or board policies are inconsistent with or do not support
GFOA Best Practices.

4. Comments on the report itself.
 Clean and concise reporting.
 Clear, readable with great embedded links. Appreciate the italicised sections to highlight new
developments.
 The budget milestones and key communications around the budget clearly demonstrate work
on respective goals.
 Clear and concise. The district’s view of the budget as a “moral document” is evident in this
report.
 Excellent report. The constant improvement shows how well the team listens to the board and
aims for both transparency to the public and high level performance. Overall, the board thinks
Budget Planning and Execution is something this district does better than 99% of the districts
in the nation. The board believes this is very important as the community continually supports
the district by approving bonds and levies.



Appreciate link to GFOA best practices.

5. Possible changes to the policy.
 Suggest changing to four-year (rather than three-year) to align with state requirements.:
2.c: “Prepare a four-year forward-looking budget for building organizational capacity to
achieve board ends in future years."
