Dr. Greg Baker has continued to meet with different staff groups to discuss the Bellingham
Promise. His latest meeting was with approximately 85 members of the Food Service staff which
resulted in great conversation about how they engage with students during breakfast and lunch.
Many of these staff members are also parents or grandparents and they shared their thoughts in
these capacities as well. Dr. Baker also met with members of the Bellingham Association of
School Employees (BASE).
Superintendent Baker introduced Brian Rick, Research and Assessment manager, and Kristie
Dominguez, Carl Cozier Elementary School kindergarten teacher. They reviewed the
kindergarten screening tools used at the beginning of the school year and in fall, winter and at the
end of the school year. They also reviewed the benchmarks for the 2010–11 vs. 2011–12 school
years comparing students in the two years. Screening tools primarily measure academic levels,
but social and emotional growth are also factors in a child’s readiness to learn.
Dr. Baker asked Assistant Superintendent Ron Cowan to give the Board an update on the district
budget. The Board will schedule a work session at a later date to study the proposed budget in
greater detail.
Annual Report on Asset Preservation Program
In compliance with Policy 6800 and state regulations, Assistant Superintendent Ron Cowan
submitted the annual report on the Asset Preservation Program. The Board received building
condition evaluations reports for district facilities built after Dec. 31, 1993, which include
Fairhaven, Kulshan, and Shuksan middle schools; and Bellingham and Squalicum high schools.
State law required this be reported to the Board prior to April 1. This is part of the Executive
Limitation 10, Asset Protection, which will be more fully reported at the April 26 School Board
meeting. Building and Grounds Manager Mike Anderson responded to questions from the Board
about the difference between poor, fair and good standards.
Audience
No audience reported.

The Board heard monitoring reports on EL-13, Academic Standards and Practices; EL-14,
Academic Program; EL-15, Instructional Materials Selection; and Monitoring Report for EL-17,
Student Conduct and Discipline.
Dr. Baker commented that EL-13, EL-14, and EL-15 are being submitted together as a means to
share the steps the district is taking to move forward with curriculum for kindergarten through
grade 12. Dr. Baker and Brian Rick shared information on curriculum alignment for various
subjects which was recently discussed with high school department chairs. In some areas

School Board Minutes

alignment is moving forward very well, but other curriculum areas will require additional work
as alignment is still in the initial stage. Dr. Baker acknowledged that curriculum alignment is
difficult to accomplish in the current economic climate. The Board would like more opportunity
to discuss curriculum alignment in greater detail at a future date.
Kenn Robinson, Student Services program administrator, presented EL-17. In response to a
question from the Board about the declining number of behavior issues, Mr. Robinson reported
staff is being more proactive at the beginning of the school year.
