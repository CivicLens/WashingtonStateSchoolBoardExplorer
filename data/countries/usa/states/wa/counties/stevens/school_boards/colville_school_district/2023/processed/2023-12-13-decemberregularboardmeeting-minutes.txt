Hofstetter Elementary School
●

PBIS-Last month we began to use the major and minor referral system in PBIS Rewards. Overall, as a staff,
we are not liking it. The two major reasons for that are the time it takes to fill out a referral and the choices
on the referral form. We are building a referral form that is more unique to Hofstetter’s needs. Sometimes,
good old paper is faster, easier, and more accessible for all. We will keep you posted on where we land.

●

Academics: On December 5, Hofstetter hosted our kindergarten families for a Title I Family Engagement
Night in math. The turnout was spectacular! All families rotated through three math stations, then ended
the evening getting their pictures taken with Santa. Our 1st and 2nd Grade night was on December 7.
Again, the turnout from our Hofstetter families was wonderful! Thank you to all the staff who worked so
hard to make these nights a success. A special thank you to Chris Hedrick for being Santa!

●

Professional Learning: LETRS cohorts are now in Unit 2 of learning. While Unit 1 focused on how our
brains learn to read and the challenges of learning to read, Unit 2 focuses on the speech sounds of English.

“Informed teachers are our best insurance against reading failure. While programs are very helpful tools,
programs don’t teach; teachers do.”
●

MTSS: MTSS is about ensuring that every student has the universal skills, academic and behavioral,
needed to be successful in school. December will be about Tier II. January will be about Tier III.

PURPOSE
MTSS Support at Hofstetter Elementary School has three purposes:
1.

To review school-wide behavior and academic data in order to evaluate the effectiveness of core programs

2.

To identify and screen students needing additional academic and/or behavioral support in their least
restrictive environment

3.

To plan, implement and modify interventions for these students depending on each student’s needs and
response to previous intervention(s)

Tier II -- Kids who aren't making progress in Tier 1 will get Tier 2 help. This usually means small group lessons two
or more times a week, using research based methods that are proven to work. Tier II intervention is specifically
targeted to address the foundational and universal skills needed to reach benchmark.

Fort Colville Elementary School
Student Enrollment: 352.69
●

Math is Cool just started back up at Fort Colville with 4th and 5th grade participating. The competition is in
March with the hopes of earning a spot in the champs competition. The kids and coaches are excited to
learn and have fun with math!

●

ASB had a fundraising event selling Fort Colville Falcon sweatshirts.

●

Each grade level at Fort Colville will have a door decorating contest! A prize will be awarded to the
winning classroom from each grade level.

●

We will complete our second round of STAR 360 testing in January to monitor student growth and
achievement of grade level standards, creating common assessments and monitoring student growth.

●

All Fort Colville students and staff took the “School District Student Safety Survey”. This survey showed
that 100% of staff Agree or Strongly Agree that staff are respectful of each other! 80% of students also feel
that students are respectful of each other.

○

Members of the PBIS team attended a Tier 2 PBIS training on December 6th. Implementation of a
student support team was discussed along with effective check in and check out strategies
including how to use student trackers to help modify problem behaviors. Trainings such as these
deepens our knowledge of PBIS and gives us more tools to help students be successful.

●

CJHS and HS Winter Concert
○

The JH and HS will be performing their winter concert on December 14th at the HS auditorium!

CJHS Explorers 1st Lego Team
○

On December 9th, two 6th grade students and two 7th grade students will be representing our
school at the FIRST Lego Robotics regional competition held at Freeman Middle School. These
students have been building, coding, and testing a robot that is built out of Legos and has
sensors/motors that are used to complete challenges on a course. The students have also been
creating an innovative project that asked them to use art and technology to share their
hobbies/interests with others. The students chose to create a mural that included all of their
favorite interests with drawings/art as well as a virtual mural in Minecraft education edition.
Students have also been learning about sportsmanship, cooperation, and gracious professionalism.

a lifetime.
Colville High School

Facilities
The third week of November we sent a camera back down the roof drain system at the Junior High. The camera was
able to identify a break in a four inch diameter copper drain line. After some careful measurements were taken, we
opened up the CMU wall and exposed the broken pipe. The necessary repairs were made and the leak in the coaches
office is now fixed! The west wall of the gym has three roof drains that have been problematic for years. I have
contacted John Lynch Construction and we are working through getting those repaired as well.
The fourth week of November was spent getting the new washer and dryer installed at Aster. All water lines and
power have been run and installed. We are waiting on one part to show up and then they will be up and running.
The first week in December has been all about completing and getting caught up on daily work orders.
We are expecting the new garbage truck to be delivered sometime in December. We have ordered the correct front
load dumpsters that pair with the truck. The dumpsters are 6 to 8 weeks out. As soon as all the necessary equipment
arrives, we will make the transition over to the new garbage system.
I want to say thank you to everyone that has helped with the above projects. Including Wards Septic Service and all
of the support staff at COLSD 115.
