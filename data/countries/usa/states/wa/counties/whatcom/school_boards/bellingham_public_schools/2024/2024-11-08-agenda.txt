The state Legislature changed the school levy laws this spring to provide additional local funds, if
approved by the district's voters during an election. This law provides communities the opportunity to vote
on whether to supplement previously approved school levy funds to help offset reductions in federal and
state funding.
This special meeting of the Board of Directors of Bellingham Public Schools is for the purpose of
exploring the possibility of a temporary supplemental levy on the November 2010 ballot or in 2011. If the
Board decides to pursue one of these options, an additional public meeting would be held to hear public
comment prior to taking any action on a resolution before the election filing date.
