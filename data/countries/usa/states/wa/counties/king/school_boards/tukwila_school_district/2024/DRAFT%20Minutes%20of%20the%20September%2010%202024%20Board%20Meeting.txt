4. Board Discussion
A. Board Goals
President Hoover shared the Board Goals document. We had our Board goals set up to talk about at the last meeting, however,
due to the fact that we didn't have all Board members present. It is important that all Board members are present as we
establish our final goals. Although not all Board members are present today, we can still have some discussion regarding goals.
We will also move this item to the September 24th Board Agenda. During our Special Meeting in June, the Board decided that
we would set three goals which included focusing on anti-racist practices, community engagement, and fiscal
management/responsibility in particular how we as a Board are ensuring that controls are being put in place to support and
prevent future binding conditions.
Under Goal #1 of Anti-Racist practices, two of the four action items have been completed. For Goals #3 and #4, we need to
think about our Norms of Engagement, particularly when items come up in our conversations that might be an unintended
microaggression, or unintentionally perpetuating antiblack norms, etc. that are not aligned with anti-racist values and how do we
disrupt that in the moment. We will work with PSESD to help us formulate what those will look like. Once approved, these will
replace the Courageous Conversation norms that we used to use.
Director Larson shared several comments:
Embedding Anti-Racism (Statement) into the District's Strategic Plan, School Improvement Plans (SIPs), Race and Equity
Policy, Board Operating Agreements, and other guiding documents.
This needs to be "one" within the core operating documents of the District.
Board Goals need to be included in the Board Operating Agreement
President Hoover shared that Director Larson's suggestions should be included as "action" items in the Board Goals document.
Superintendent Pedroza shared that we should have the updated Race & Equity policy ready for first review and adoption in
October.
There was discussion on incorporating anti-racism into staff evaluations using SMARTIE goals and embedding these principles
into professional development.
Director Simpson shared that he will add action items under Goal #2.
President Hoover shared that this item will be added to the September 24th Agenda for review and finalization.
B. WSSDA General Assembly Voting
Director Larson shared that the WSSDA General Assembly is happening next week. Anyone is welcome to attend either in person
or virtual. If you have any legislative issues you want to see added, connect with Director Larson
After the voting process, the next step is the prioritization which will be in October. Director Larson will bring back the prioritized
list for our Board to rank their top 10 items.
President Hoover took a moment to thank everyone for the amazing start to the school year. They shared that they had the
opportunity to attend the All Staff Kick-Off event. Just like last year's kick-off, it had this energy that can't be replicated. There
was excitement to be there in this collectiveness and they wanted to again say thank you. They shared that the start of any new
year involves a lot of long hours and days and they are grateful for everyone here in this room and every person in every
building doing the hard work to serve our kids.
5. Questions Only - Presentations
A. Enrollment and Attendance - 4th Day Count
B. Instructional Minutes - Final Calendar

C. Annual Report - Sexual Harassment Prohibited per Policies 3205 and 5011
Director Larson commented on the evaluation of Train the Trainer. He noticed there was a component to make some of the
protocols a little more aware. He shared that was his only concern was to make sure that if any incident came up students felt
safe to report it. Hopefully, there is a safe space where students can go to report an incident. He shared that he was glad to
see that this is being re-evaluated and looking at additional options for reporting.
President Hoover shared that one of the biggest themes that was heard when they were on the Safety and Inclusion taskforce
was not knowing how to report and what they could report. We need to make sure that when a person is reporting we need to
make sure they feel valued, heard, and safe. Additionally, another lengthy discussion was around the workload/capacity of the
Title X Coordinator as they do have other workload responsibilities. Has there been any additional thoughts or movements on
ensuring that this person is set up for success for this role? Executive Director Draganov shared that there has been several
discussions on this and as they are looking for alternative ways for students to report, they are also making sure systems are in
place to ensure none of the reports are missed. Additonally, this position works in collaboration with Human Resources on any
report that is received. Additionally, the Building Administrators will be the first party to investigate the reports.
Director Kruller asked if there was any follow-up / feedback on the effectiveness of the current reporting system/process.
Executive Director Draganov shared there is a built-in comment feature and we have received some great feedback. The HR
team does reach out if we have any additional questions. Feedback received has been to make it more engaging instead of just
"clicking" responses. This feedback has been shared with the developers and they have made improvements this year.
President Hoover commented that the restorative practices and healing circles will increase staff skills and knowledge which will
help students to feel heard, valued and safe to report.
Director Larson asked when a student reports, are the parents informed? What are the legal requirements? Executive Director
Draganov will need to research and will follow up with the Board. Currently, it is a practice that we do, but not certain that it is a
legal requirement.
D. Interscholastic Activities Report per Policy 2151
Director Larson shared that when people hear interscholatic activities, they think of Athletics, but it's actually more than that.
Those additional activities would include robotics, environmental sciences, etc. We need to keep these on the radar so that we
can fund them, celebrate, etc.
Superintendent Pedroza shared that Policy 2151 will need to be updated to include "additional activities" that are not under
WIAA. The updated policy will be included on the October 22nd Board Agenda along with the updated additional activities list as
requested by Director Larson.
President Hoover asked how are we ensuring that we are supporting our gender/trans students. They want to make sure we are
providing opportunities for everyone. They know that we may have a policy, but what does that look like in practice as far as
young people feeling that belongingness and ability to be able to feel comfortable in a sport?
E. Public Records Transparency Report per Policy 6030
F. Staffing Report - 23-24
Director Larson shared that he recognized that staff diversity is moving in a positive direction.
Director Kruller asked with the staff reductions this year, did we lose a big percentage in that aspect? Executive Director
Draganov shared that we are currently staffed at 187 out of 200 teachers. We have also had some resignations, so those are the
positions we are hiring back.
President Hoover acknowledged the impact and the difficulty of sitting through many exit interviews. They thanked Mr. Draganov
and shared that they have heard, often how kind and thoughtful he is.
G. Engagement Plan
Director Larson thanked the staff for creating the engagement plan. He shared that he appreciated the specific inclusion of
parents. He shared that we need a minimum of two parents, as it is very intimidating coming into this space. This is the same
situation for students. He emphasized that we need to include Race & Equity members in the process and reach out to other
groups for participation.
It was suggested to keep the information high level and to communicate clearly regarding the current budget, and why we need
more funding from the state.
Director Kruller commented that the time and date needed to be included. President Hoover shared that the first meeting should
include education on the budget, i.e. Budget 101. They shared we should also consider before and after-school partners for child
care during these meetings, usually funded through the pTS, and having food available. Director Larson added that translators
and community liaisons would be extremely helpful.
H. CEE Student, Parent, and Staff Survey - Data & Analysis

Director Larson commented that every year the question "most students are respectful to others" is a really low one that we
have not been able to crack. We need to look at street data. What is at the core of this? Belong Partners may have some
strategies to work on this. We need to establish a culture in which students feel respected by each other. Another question is
"another one: do you see yourself in the curriculum?" This is another question we need to look at.
President Hoover shared that when they saw this data, the first question was what opportunities are we creating, whether that is
teachers in the classroom or just as a whole building, of really creating opportunities where young people can spend time just
getting to know each other, building rapport, and community with each other. If we are so focused on instructional minutes,
building community can be instructional minutes. Are the lessons engaging for students? Additionally, we need to add some
high-level definitions around respect. Respect can look really different for different cultures, etc.
