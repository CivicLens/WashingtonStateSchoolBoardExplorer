To:

Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

From: Shawn Lewis
Subject: Financial Update
Attached are the Budget Status Reports for all funds as of the end of March 2024, along with
charts and data showing our monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund cash
balance.
Enrollment is generally flat – no significant increase or decrease in our schools or in the Running
Start program.
Our General Fund Balance is extremely steady at $1.7 million – and changed only by $12,938
from last month.
General Fund cash balance as of the end of March is $1,736,940. In the attached charts, you
may notice that the cash and investment balance change from last year is not as significant this
month as it was last month. The reason for this is due to the large cash transfer we made last
year from the Capital Projects Fund – and should not cause any concern about this year’s
activity. The cash balance reported for this month is actually a little better than we anticipated
– mainly because we have several large bills that we are paying in April – including a $600,000
invoice for Running Start at Pierce College and a $325,000 invoice for insurance.
Capital Projects Fund balance is nearly $460,000 as we continue receiving capital projects and
technology levy proceeds following last November’s successful election. In May, I anticipate
transferring about $1.6 million from the capital projects fund to the debt service fund for future
payment of the McNeil Street property. We also anticipate other large capital project expenses
to begin, with the Cherrydale HVAC system being the single largest expense. Smaller expenses
include traffic studies, which have already started at our elementary schools.
No items of significance to report in other funds.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

The Washington School Improvement Framework (WSIF) serves as a guide for schools
seeking improvement, consolidating up to nine indicators including attendance, graduation
rates, and proficiency in English Language Arts and Math into a 1-10 score. This score
determines the level of state support allocated to each school for improvement efforts.
Initially launched in March 2018, WSIF was temporarily halted during the COVID-19
pandemic and resumed its operations in March 2023, with a subsequent update in March
2024.
In the 2023 assessment, both Pioneer Middle School and Saltar’s Point Elementary were
classified as Targeted Tier I schools. Pioneer fell short of the All Schools Threshold for
Students with Disabilities, while Saltar’s Point failed to meet the Title I Threshold for
Students with Disabilities and Multi-Lingual Learners.
In the March 2024 iteration, Cherrydale Primary, Anderson Island Elementary, Chloe Clark
Elementary, Pioneer Middle School, and Steilacoom High School were all categorized as
Foundational, signaling that they have not been identified by OSPI as needing
improvement. Saltar’s Point saw a modest improvement in the category of Students with
Disabilities, but remains in improvement status.
Having missed the Title I Threshold for two consecutive years in two categories, Saltar’s
Point is now eligible for federal grant funds of up to $27,000. These funds will be utilized for
school improvement initiatives commencing in the 2024-2025 academic year.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
No action needed, information only.

Washington School Improvement Framework (WSIF)
The Washington School Improvement Framework (WSIF) identifies how schools
can improve the education of all students. The Framework combines as many
as nine indicators (such as graduation rates, attendance, and proficiency on
state tests in math and English language arts) into a 1-10 score. The school's
score then determines the state's supports for the school to improve.
• For the 2023 Identification, there are some differences in calculations as the
impact of COVID‐19 data disruptions linger because we use three years of
data for calculating WSIF:
●
●

Used assessment data from the three most recent years of available
data: SY 2018–2019, SY 2021–2022, and SY 2022–2023.
Used only the Median Student Growth Percentile Measure for the
Other Academic Indicator using growth calculations from SY 2018 to
SY 2019 and SY 2022 to SY 2023.

• The English Language Proficiency (ELP) assessment is now calculated
exclusively with WIDA.

Identification
Identification: Washington uses two threshold scores in its identification
process:
●

The first applies to all schools with a WSIF Composite School Score,
and it is equal to the lowest performing five percent of schools
based on the All Students student group. For the 2023 Identification,
the threshold is 2.25. This is called the All Schools Threshold. The
following school MUST meet the All Schools Threshold:
○
○
○

●

Steilacoom HIgh School
Pioneer Middle School
Chloe Clark Elementary

The second applies to Title I schools with a WSIF Composite School
Score, and it is equal to the lowest performing five percent of Title I
schools based on the All Students student group. For the 2023
Identification, the threshold is 1.90. This is called the Title I Threshold.
THe following schools must meet the Title I Threshold:
○

Note:
Last year the All Schools
Threshold was 2.85
The Title I Threshold was

II. PRESENTATION - Recognition of Education Support Professionals
Susanne Beauchaine, Executive Director for Human Resources, thanked the district's amazing
education support professionals for keeping our students safe, healthy, and ready to learn. The
district currently employs 69 paraeducators/library techs/campus supervisors, 27
custodians/grounds/maintenance staff, 22 office professionals, 7 licensed professional nurses,
and 2 information technology staff members. Mary Hilton, President of the SCEA, joined Ms.
Beauchaine for the presentation.
III. COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE
Mary Hilton, SCEA President, thanked the SHSD Board of Directors and the district for
recognizing the district's classified staff. She shared the district's paraeducators are burned out
and she is concerned we will lose valuable staff. She asked the directors to visit the buildings to
see how hard staff work.
IV. REPORTS

balance, and general fund cash balance. Mr. Lewis shared enrollment is generally flat with no
significant increase or decrease to our schools or in the Running Start program. The district has
begun receiving capital projects and technology level proceeds following last November's
successful election. In May, about $1.6 million will be transferred from the capital projects fund
to the debt service fund for future payment of the McNeil Street property. There are no items of
significance to report in other funds. Overall cash flow remains low but acceptable, and the
district does not anticipate needing an interfund loan this year. The district will need to do a
budget extension later in the year due to the large enrollment of students participating in
Running Start.
Director Rohrer shared she and Director Tinsley participate in the board audit committee, and
she shared Mr. Lewis and the district's administrators have done a great job to get the district
back on track and the district is ready to do great things moving forward. Director Tinsley
reiterated she appreciates the transparency of the district and the focus on minimizing
expenses. Director McDonald shared she is impressed by Mr. Lewis's financial abilities and she
appreciates the sacrifices the district's staff is making. She appreciates the staff and the
exceptional job they have done. Chair Scott shared with 3 months left in the school year, staff
should reach out to Kiwanis for support through their Mini Grants.
C. Legislative Update
Director Rohrer shared information regarding HB2494 as well as other bills, resolutions, and
funding decisions. She also shared about SB5462 involving inclusive learning standards and the
implications of that bill. She shared all increases in funding are nominal increases.
V. CONSENT AGENDA
Director McDonald made a motion to approve the Consent Agenda, Director Tinsley seconded
the motion, and the motion passed (4/0). The Consent Agenda included February and March
2024 Accounts Payable and February 2024 Payroll; February 21, 2024 Regular Board Meeting
Minutes; Personnel Reports; Sports Boosters Donation; Cherrydale HVAC Unit Replacement Bid
Award; Resolution 921-03-20-24 Cancellation of Municipal Warrant; and Approval of Contract
with Long Building Technologies for SHS DDC Controls Replacement Project.
VI. NEW BUSINESS
A. Approval of Resolution 920-03-20-24 Success Conferences Waiver
Mr. Lewis presented Resolution 920-03-20-24 Success Conferences Waiver. The district would
like to continue the use of the first two days of the school year to meet with first through fifth
grade students and their families in “Success Conferences.” We believe that these conferences
have helped set the stage for a better learning environment and higher academic achievement.
While there is a requirement to provide 180 days of instruction for all students, parent teacher
conferences may be conducted in lieu of these days if a waiver is submitted to the state
accompanied by a board resolution. While the district has other school conference days in the
school calendar, a resolution and waiver request is only required when districts use a full day for
parent teacher conferences. This proposal has been discussed with our school principals and
with the Steilacoom Education Association, and both groups support the proposal and the focus
on connecting directly with students and families before the school year starts.
Director Rohrer made a motion to approve Resolution 920-03-20-24 Success Conferences
Waiver, Director McDonald seconded the motion, and the motion passed (4/0).
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

B. Approval of Resolution 919-03-20-24 Month of the Military Child
Mary Snyder, Director of Student Supports, shared Resolution 919-03-20-24 Month of the
Military Child. Through April, in recognition of the Month of the Military Child, Steilacoom
Historical School District honors our military-connected and civilian families who, together,
ensure all our children thrive.
The Steilacoom Historical School District, in conjunction with community partners, is planning an
exciting month of celebrations designed to bring all our military and civilian families together for
fun-filled activities and resource sharing. Families will have access to both virtual and in-person
events in April including virtual field trips, community organization activities, creative art
experiences, and of course: SteillyCon.
The accompanying resolution honors and recognizes our military children and families,
encourages all school staff and community members to support and participate in activities to
recognize and support our military-connected youth, and declares April to be the Month of the
Military Child in the Steilacoom Historical School District.
Director McDonald made a motion to approve Resolution 919-03-20-24 Month of the Military
Child, Director Tinsley seconded the motion, and the motion passed (4/0).
C. Board Goal - Professional Learning
The Board established professional learning goals for the 2023-24 school year based on the
most recent Board self-evaluation process. This agenda item is a “standing” item at our Regular
Board Meetings to provide an opportunity for Board members to discuss and share around their
goals.
Chair Scott shared about WSSDA's Regional Meeting in Carbonado on May 16 as an option for
board members to work towards their professional learning goals and to develop their
expertise. He also reminded everyone about the SHSD Board Retreat on March 26 which will be
held in the PDC.
VII. BOARD COMMUNICATION
• Chair Scott shared he received an Invitation to a JBLM Educator Event vent at North Fort
Conference Center on April 11.
• Chair Scott also shared about emails received from Mr. Nolan McNamara concerning
students being discriminated against in interscholastic sports programs. There was
confusion because the documents mentioned Tacoma Public School District and not
SHSD, but Chair Scott was able to connect with Mr. McNamara, and he appreciated his
thoughts also being shared with our district. Chair Scott is passing this message on to
Superintendent Weight for follow up.

ISSUE
☒ Action - Personnel Action – Recommendation for Hire of Cherrydale Principal
☐ Information

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
The posting for the Cherrydale Primary Principal position on March 13th received significant interest, with
33 candidates applying. Prior to evaluating applicants, Dr. Weight and district staff held a listening session
with our Cherrydale team to gather input on the essential qualifications and skills for the role. Cherrydale
families were also invited to provide feedback through a survey.
This feedback played a crucial role in shaping the screening and interview protocols during the selection
process. A comprehensive screening, interview, and reference check process was conducted with Cherrydale
staff participation.
Following this process and in accordance with Board policy 5000, the Superintendent recommends Mrs.
Christine Firth for the role of principal at Cherrydale Primary School. Mrs. Firth has been the Assistant
Principal at Cherrydale Primary School, Chloe Clark Elementary School, and Saltar’s Point Elementary School
since 2021. Prior to this, she served as the Dean of Students in the district for three years and had a ten-year
tenure as a classroom teacher.
Mrs. Firth holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Family Studies from Central Washington University, a Master’s
Degree in Teaching, and a Master’s Degree in Education Administration from City University of Seattle. She
is certified in Elementary Education Teaching and holds a Principal Administration Certification.
We are delighted to welcome Mrs. Firth back to Cherrydale, where she began her teaching journey as a
Kindergarten teacher. Her extensive leadership experience within our district, combined with her dedication
to our students, staff, and families, makes her the ideal candidate for the position of Cherrydale principal.
FISAL IMPLICATIONS:
Replacing existing employee
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
It is the recommendation of the Superintendent that the Board approve issuance of a contract to Christine
Firth for the position of Cherrydale Primary principal to commence on July 1, 2024.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Mary Snyder has worked with Veteran Affairs Puget Sound Healthcare to provide a therapeutic,
integrated arts program for selected students. Their focus is to provide additional supports for
military connected youth.
This program is provided at no cost to the district. All staff provided by Veteran Affairs Puget Sound
Healthcare will be vetted through our normal contractor process by Human Resources.
As our normal process, for interagency agreements and MOUs with government entities that
provide services to students at no cost, the District Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent
approve these and then provide to the board as part of the consent agenda. If the Board ultimately
does not approve as part of the consent agenda, the district would cease services immediately and
provide 30 days notice for termination.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Approve the Memorandum of Understanding with Veteran Affairs Puget Sound Healthcare.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Each year, millions of Americans face the reality of living with a mental health condition. However,
mental illness affects everyone directly or indirectly through family, friends, classmates, or
colleagues. That is why this year, during the month of May, Steilacoom Historical School District and
others across the country will work to raise awareness of mental illness, decrease the stigma
associated with mental illness and connect our community with resources and support through
Mental Health Awareness Month.
We believe that mental health conditions are important to discuss year-round, but highlighting them
during this month provides a dedicated time for educators and families to come together as one
unified voice.
The accompanying resolution recognizes that mental health is essential for a person's overall
health. Prevention works, treatment is effective, and people can recover from mental disorders and
live full and productive lives. We encourage all school staff and community members to support and
participate in activities to recognize and support mental health awareness, and we declare May to
be Mental Health Awareness Month in the Steilacoom Historical School District.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
It is Superintendent’s recommendation that the School Board adopt Resolution No 922-04-17-24

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

The State Auditor’s Office has completed their audit of the 2022-23 school year. As part of the
board materials, we have provided a copy of the final audit report and the exit conference summary.
In summary:
•
•
•

The district had no findings related to internal controls
The district had no findings related to compliance with federal programs
The district financial position was found to be fairly stated in accordance with OSPI and
SAO financial reporting requirements

There were a few recommendations made by the auditors related to financial reporting and internal
controls, but all recommendations were identified as immaterial. Even though immaterial, the
district implemented several of those recommendations and appreciates the work performed by the
State Auditor’s Office.
Due to a finding in the prior year, the district originally anticipated audit costs would be roughly
$35,000 in the current school year. Instead due to the efforts of district staff and efficient auditors,
we incurred audit costs, the actual costs were much lower. The district has already extended its
appreciation to the audit staff for their efforts to save the district resources.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:

No action required.

The District did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with federal wage

Background:
The District did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with federal wage

in a construction contract or collect weekly certified payroll reports from the contractor and its
subcontractors to confirm they paid laborers the proper prevailing wages.

Corrective Action Taken:
The District has trained staff responsible for public works contracts to review the funding source
for all public works contracts. Whenever a public works contract is funded with federal
resources, District staff are now aware of the requirement to include the required federal wage
rate clauses. The District’s Assistant Superintendent is responsible for reviewing every public
works contract and has reviewed applicable federal and state public works laws to better
understand the required wage rate clauses and will review for these clauses prior to approval.
The District Maintenance and Facilities Manager is now responsible for collecting weekly
certified payroll reports from the contractor and its subcontractors to confirm they paid the
proper prevailing wages. While the District did not manage any federally funded public works

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other
Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with
Government Auditing Standards
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1
September 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023
Board of Directors
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1
Steilacoom, Washington
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing
Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1, as of and for the year ended August 31, 2023, and the
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s financial
statements, and have issued our report thereon dated March 25, 2024.
We issued an unmodified opinion on the fair presentation of the District’s financial statements in
accordance with its regulatory basis of accounting. We issued an adverse opinion on the fair
presentation with regard to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAP) because, as described in Note 1, the Accounting Manual for Public School
Districts in the State of Washington does not require the District to prepare the government-wide
statements presenting the financial position and changes in financial position of its governmental
activities as required by GAAP. The effects on the financial statements of the variances between
the basis of accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material.

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s
internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial
statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s
internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s
internal control.

Office of the Washington State Auditor

sao.wa.gov

Page 8
Packet page 134 of 181

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent,
or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the District’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and
corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of
deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough
to merit attention by those charged with governance.
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described above and was not
designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or
significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist
that were not identified.
Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control
that we consider to be material weaknesses.

REPORT ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free
from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws,
regulations, contracts and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and
material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with
those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion.
The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required
to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the
District’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed
in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control
and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. However,

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program and Report on Internal
Control over Compliance in Accordance with the Uniform Guidance

September 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023
Board of Directors

Steilacoom, Washington

REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL
PROGRAM
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program
We have audited the compliance of Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1, with the types of
compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the U.S. Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the
District’s major federal programs for the year ended August 31, 2023. The District’s major federal
programs are identified in the auditor’s results section of the accompanying Schedule of Findings
and Questioned Costs.
In our opinion, the District complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major
federal programs for the year ended August 31, 2023.
Basis for Opinion on Each Major Federal Program
We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financial audits contained in
Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the
audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance)
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our
report.
We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in
accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on

compliance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination on
the District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.
Responsibilities of Management for Compliance
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the
design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the
requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules and provisions of contracts or grant agreements
applicable to the District’s federal programs.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the
compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an
opinion on the District’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards and the Uniform Guidance will always
detect a material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material noncompliance
resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material, if there
is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgement
made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the District’s compliance with the
requirements of each major federal program as a whole.
Performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards and the Uniform
Guidance includes the following responsibilities:
•
•

•

Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit;
Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the District’s compliance with the
compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances;
Obtain an understanding of the District’s internal control over compliance relevant to the
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to
test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform
Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
District’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed; and

•

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among
other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the
audit.

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing
their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of
compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal
control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over
compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of
compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on
a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance
requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control
over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.
Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal
control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. Our consideration of internal
control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities
for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in
internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in
internal control over compliance and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies
may exist that were not identified.
Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control
over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above.
Purpose of this Report
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of
our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the
requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other

purpose. However, this report is a matter of public record and its distribution is not limited. It also
serves to disseminate information to the public as a reporting tool to help citizens assess
government operations.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1
September 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023
Board of Directors
Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1
Steilacoom, Washington

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Unmodified and Adverse Opinions
We have audited the financial statements of Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1, as of and
for the year ended August 31, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in
the financial section of our report.
Unmodified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting (Accounting Manual)
As described in Note 1 the District has prepared these financial statements to meet the financial
reporting requirements of state law and the accounting practices prescribed by the Accounting
Manual for Public School Districts in the State of Washington (Accounting Manual). Those
accounting practices differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAP). The differences in these accounting practices are also described in Note 1.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the regulatory basis financial position of Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1, as of the year
ended August 31, 2023, and the regulatory basis of changes in financial position thereof for the
year then ended, on the basis of accounting as described in Note 1.
Adverse Opinion on U.S. GAAP
The financial statements referred to above were not intended to, and in our opinion they do not,
present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, the financial position of Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1, as of August 31,
2023, or the changes in financial position or cash flows thereof for the year then ended, because
of the significance of the matter discussed below.

Office of the Washington State Auditor

sao.wa.gov

Page 15
Packet page 141 of 181

Basis for Unmodified and Adverse Opinions
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAS) and Governmental Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the District, and to meet
our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to
our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our unmodified and adverse audit opinions.
Matter Giving Rise to Adverse Opinion on U.S. GAAP
Auditing standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
require auditors to formally acknowledge when governments do not prepare their financial
statements, intended for general use, in accordance with GAAP. As described in Note 1 of the
financial statements, the government-wide financial statements are prepared by the District in
accordance with state law using accounting practices prescribed by the Accounting Manual, which
is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of
accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material and pervasive.
Matters of Emphasis
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2023, the District adopted new accounting
guidance for presentation and disclosure for Subscription-Based Information Technology
Arrangements (SBITA), as required by the Accounting Manual. Our opinion is not modified with
respect to this matter.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with the financial reporting provisions of state law and the Accounting Manual
described in Note 1. This includes determining that the basis of accounting is acceptable for the
presentation of the financial statements in the circumstances. Management is also responsible for
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and
fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are
conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District’s
ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date,
including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute
assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and
Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial
likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a
reasonable user based on the financial statements.
Performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards includes the
following responsibilities:
•
•

•

•

•

•

Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit;
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.
Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements;
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, no such
opinion is expressed;
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall
presentation of the financial statements;
Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District’s ability to continue as a going
concern for a reasonable period of time; and
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among
other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and
certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

Supplementary Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken
as a whole. The accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is presented for
purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for
Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). The Schedule of Long-Term Liabilities is also presented for

Office of the Washington State Auditor

sao.wa.gov

Page 17
Packet page 143 of 181

purposes of additional analysis, as required by the prescribed Accounting Manual. These schedules
are not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of
management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other
records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements, and certain additional procedures,
including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and
other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves,
and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects,
in relation to the financial statements as a whole.

OTHER REPORTING REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENT AUDITING
STANDARDS
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated
March 25, 2024 on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and
on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant
agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of
internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to
provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or on
compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government
Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and
compliance.

STEILACOOM HISTORICAL SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1

Notes to the Financial Statements
September 1, 2022 Through August 31, 2023

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 (District) is a municipal corporation organized
pursuant to Title 28A of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) for the purposes of providing
public school services to students in grades K–12. Oversight responsibility for the District’s
operations is vested with the independently elected board of directors. Management of the
District is appointed by and is accountable to the board of directors. Fiscal responsibility,
including budget authority and the power to set fees, levy property taxes, and issue debt
consistent with provisions of state statutes, also rests with the board of directors.
The District presents governmental fund financial statements and related notes on the modified
accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the Accounting Manual for Public School Districts
in the State of Washington, issued jointly by the State Auditor’s Office and the Superintendent of
Public Instruction by the authority of RCW 43.09.200, RCW 28A.505.140, RCW 28A.505.010(1)
and RCW 28A.505.020. This manual prescribes a financial reporting framework that differs from
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the following manner:
(1) Districtwide statements, as defined in GAAP, are not presented.
(2) A Schedule of Long-Term Liabilities is presented as supplementary information.
(3) Supplementary information required by GAAP is not presented.
(4) Property Taxes collected after the end of the fiscal period are not considered available
for revenue accrual as described below.

Fund Accounting
Financial transactions of the District are reported in individual funds Each fund uses a separate
set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenues, and
expenditures (or expenses) as appropriate. All funds are considered major funds. The various
funds in the report are grouped into governmental funds as follows:
Governmental Funds
General Fund
This fund is used to account for all expendable financial resources, except for those that are
required to be accounted for in another fund. In keeping with the principle of having as few
funds as are necessary, activities such as food services, maintenance, data processing,
printing, and student transportation are included in the General Fund.

Page 25
Packet page 151 of 181

Capital Projects Funds
These funds account for financial resources that are to be used for the construction or
acquisition of major capital assets. There are two funds that are considered to be of the
capital projects fund type: the Capital Projects Fund and the Transportation Vehicle Fund.
Capital Projects Fund. This fund is used to account for resources set aside for the
acquisition and construction of major capital assets such as land and buildings.
Transportation Vehicle Fund. This fund is used to account for the purchase, major repair,
rebuilding, and debt service expenditures that relate to pupil transportation equipment.
Debt Service Fund
This fund is used to account for the accumulation of resources for and the payment of
matured general long-term debt principal and interest.
Special Revenue Fund
In Washington state, the only allowable special revenue fund for school districts is the
Associated Student Body (ASB) Fund. This fund is accounted for in the District’s financial
statements as the financial resources legally belong to the District. As a special revenue fund,
amounts within the ASB Fund may only be used for those purposes that relate to the
operation of the Associated Student Body of the District.

Measurement focus, basis of accounting, and fund financial statement
presentation
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as
soon as they are measurable and available. Revenues are considered “measurable” if the amount
of the transaction can be readily determined. Revenues are considered “available” when they are
collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current
period. For this purpose, the District considers revenues to be available if they are collected
within 60 days after year-end. Categorical program claims and interdistrict billings are
measurable and available and are accrued. Property taxes not collected by the fiscal year end are
measurable and recorded as a receivable, however the receivable is not considered available
revenue and is recorded as a deferred inflow of resources.
Expenditures are recognized under the modified accrual basis of accounting when the related
fund liability is incurred, except for unmatured principal and interest on long-term debt which
are recorded when due. Purchases of capital assets are expensed during the year of acquisition.
For federal grants, the recognition of expenditures is dependent on the obligation date.

Page 26
Packet page 152 of 181

(Obligation means a purchase order has been issued, contracts have been awarded, or goods
and/or services have been received.)
Budgets
Chapter 28A.505 RCW and Chapter 392-123 Washington Administrative Code (WAC) mandate
school district budget policies and procedures. The board adopts annual appropriated budgets
for all governmental funds. These budgets are appropriated at the fund level. The budget
constitutes the legal authority for expenditures at that level. Appropriations lapse at the end of
the fiscal period.
Budgets are adopted on the same modified accrual basis as used for financial reporting. Fund
balance is budgeted as available resources and, under statute, may not be negative, unless the
District enters into binding conditions with state oversight pursuant to RCW 28A.505.110.
The government’s policy regarding whether to first apply restricted or unrestricted
resources when an expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and
unrestricted net assets are available.
The District receives state funding for specific categorical education-related programs. Amounts
that are received for these programs that are not used in the current fiscal year may be carried
forward into the subsequent fiscal year, where they may be used only for the same purpose as
they were originally received. When the District has such carryover, those funds are expended
before any amounts received in the current year are expended.
Additionally, the District has other restrictions placed on its financial resources. When
expenditures are recorded for purposes for which a restriction or commitment of fund balance is
available, those funds that are restricted or committed to that purpose are considered first
before any unrestricted or unassigned amounts are expended.
The government’s fund balance classifications policies and procedures.
The District classifies ending fund balance for its governmental funds into five categories.
Nonspendable Fund Balance. The amounts reported as Nonspendable are resources of the
District that are not in spendable format. They are either non-liquid resources such as inventory
or prepaid items, or the resources are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact.
Restricted Fund Balance. Amounts that are reported as Restricted are those resources of the
District that have had a legal restriction placed on their use either from statute, WAC, or other
legal requirements that are beyond the control of the board of directors. Restricted fund
balance includes anticipated recovery of revenues that have been received but are restricted as
to their usage.

Page 27
Packet page 153 of 181

Committed Fund Balance. Amounts that are reported as Committed are those resources of the
District that have had a limitation placed upon their usage by formal action of the District’s
board of directors. Commitments are made either through a formal adopted board resolution or
are related to a school board policy. Commitments may only be changed when the resources
are used for the intended purpose or the limitation is removed by a subsequent formal action of
the board of directors.
Assigned Fund Balance. In the General Fund, amounts that are reported as Assigned are those
resources that the District has set aside for specific purposes. These accounts reflect tentative
management plans for future financial resource use such as the replacement of equipment or
the assignment of resources for contingencies. Assignments reduce the amount reported as
Unassigned Fund Balance, but may not reduce that balance below zero.
In other governmental funds, Assigned fund balance represents a positive ending spendable
fund balance once all restrictions and commitments are considered. These resources are only
available for expenditure in that fund and may not be used in any other fund without formal
action by the District’s board of directors and as allowed by statute.
The Superintendent and the District Board of Directors are the only persons who have the
authority to create Assignments of fund balance.
Unassigned Fund Balance. In the General Fund, amounts that are reported as Unassigned are
those net spendable resources of the District that are not otherwise Restricted, Committed, or
Assigned, and may be used for any purpose within the General Fund.
In other governmental funds, Unassigned fund balance represents a deficit ending spendable
fund balance once all restrictions and commitments are considered.
A negative Unassigned fund balance means that the legal restrictions and formal commitments
of the District exceed its currently available resources.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
All of the District’s cash and cash equivalents are considered to be cash on hand, demand
deposits, and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less from the
date of acquisition.

Receivables and Payables
All receivables and payables are expected to be collected or paid within one year.

Capitalization Threshold for Leases and Subscription-Based Information
Technology Arrangements (SBITAs)
The District had one lease for copiers in place as of 8/31/2023.
The District had no SBITAs that extended beyond one year as of 8/31/2023.
The District follows the modified accrual basis of accounting in its treatment of leases and
SBITAs. Agreements are evaluated regarding the lease term, payments, and discount rates as
well as materiality to the District’s financial position. The District’s capitalization threshold for
recognition of leases and SBITAs is twenty thousand dollars ($20,000). Arrangements that are
considered short term or do not meet capitalization thresholds are treated as revenues and
expenditures in the current year.

Inventory
The District had no inventory as of the end of the year.

NOTE 2: DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS
All of the District’s bank balances are insured by the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) or by collateral held in a multiple financial institution collateral pool administered by the
Washington Public Deposit Protection Commission (PDPC).
Statutes authorize the District to invest in (1) securities, certificates, notes, bonds, short-term
securities, or other obligations of the United States, and (2) deposits in any state bank or trust
company, national banking association, stock savings bank, mutual savings bank, savings and
loan association, and any branch bank engaged in banking in the state in accordance with RCW
30.04.300 if the institution has been approved by the Public Deposit Protection Commission to
hold public deposits and has segregated eligible collateral having a value of not less than its
maximum liability.
The Pierce County Treasurer is the ex officio treasurer for the District and holds all accounts of
the District. The District directs the County Treasurer to invest those financial resources of the
District that the District has determined are not needed to meet the current financial obligations
of the District.
The district’s deposits and certificates of deposit are mostly covered by federal depository
insurance (FDIC) or by collateral held in a multiple financial institution collateral pool
administered by the Washington Public Deposit Protection Commission (PDPC).
The district’s participation in the Pierce County Investment Pool is voluntary and the pool does
not have a credit rating. The district reports its investment in the pool at the fair value amount,

Page 29
Packet page 155 of 181

which is the same as the value of the pool per share. The fair value of the district’s investment in
the pool is measured using a net asset value (NAV) as determined by the pool. The pool
maintains a weighted average maturity of 60 days or less.
All of the District’s investments during the year and at year-end were insured or registered and
held by the District or its agent in the District’s name.

Washington State statutes authorize the district to invest in the following types of securities:
 Certificates, notes, or bonds of the United States, its agencies, or any corporation wholly
owned by the government of the United States,
 Obligations of government-sponsored corporations which are eligible as collateral for
advances to member banks as determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System,
 Bankers’ acceptances purchased on the secondary market,
 Repurchase agreements for securities listed in the three items above, provided that the
transaction is structured so that the public treasurer obtains control over the underlying
securities,
 Investment deposits with qualified public depositories,
 Washington State Local Government Investment Pool, and
 County Treasurer Investment Pools.

The District’s investments as of August 31, 2023, are as follows:

NOTE 3: SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The District Board of Directors placed a Capital Projects Levy on the November 7, 2023 ballot in
the amount of $6 million to be collected in 2024 and $6 million to be collected in 2025. $4
million of the total $12 million Capital Projects Levy is assigned to pay the outstanding principal
of non-voted debt. The voters of the district passed the levy with over 57% supporting the
measure. The district certified the levy collection to Pierce County and will use the proceeds in
the 2024 to pay for the outstanding principal as identified in the authorizing resolution.

NOTE 4: PENSION PLANS
General Information
The Washington State Department of Retirement Systems (DRS), a department within the
primary government of the state of Washington, prepares a stand-alone annual comprehensive
financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for
each pension plan. The pension plan’s basic financial statement is accounted for using the
accrual basis of accounting. The measurement date of the pension plans is June 30. Benefit
payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable
in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.
The school district is reporting the net pension liability in the notes and on the Schedule of
Long-term Liabilities calculated as the district’s proportionate allocation percentage multiplied
by the total plan collective net pension liability. The DRS total collective net pension liabilities for
the pension plans school districts participate in are shown here.

The Collective Net Pension Liability (Asset)

Membership Participation
Substantially all school district full-time and qualifying part-time employees participate in one of
the following three contributory, multi-employer, cost-sharing statewide retirement systems
managed by DRS: Teachers’ Retirement System (TRS), Public Employees’ Retirement System
(PERS) and School Employees’ Retirement System (SERS).

Membership & Plan Benefits
Certificated employees are members of TRS. Classified employees are members of PERS (if Plan
1) or SERS. Plan 1 under the TRS and PERS programs are defined benefit pension plans whose
members joined the system on or before September 30, 1977. TRS 1 and PERS 1 are closed to
new entrants.
TRS Plan Information
TRS was established in 1938, and its retirement provisions are contained in Chapters 41.32
and 41.34 RCW. TRS eligibility for membership requires service as a certificated, publicschool employee working in an instructional, administrative, or supervisory capacity. TRS is a
cost-sharing multi-employer retirement system comprised of three separate plans for
membership purposes: Plans 1 and 2 are defined benefit plans and Plan 3 is a defined
benefit plan with a defined contribution component.
TRS is comprised of three separate plans for accounting purposes: Plan 1, Plan 2/3, and Plan
3. Plan 1 accounts for the defined benefits of Plan 1 members. Plan 2/3 accounts for the
defined benefits of Plan 2 members and the defined benefit portion of benefits for Plan 3
members. Plan 3 accounts for the defined contribution portion of benefits for Plan 3
members. Although members can only be a member of either Plan 2 or Plan 3, the defined
benefit portions of Plan 2 and Plan 3 are accounted for in the same pension trust fund. All
assets of this Plan 2/3 defined benefit plan may legally be used to pay the defined benefits
of any of the Plan 2 or Plan 3 members or beneficiaries, as defined by the terms of the plan.
Therefore, Plan 2/3 is a single plan for accounting purposes.
TRS Plan 1 provides retirement, disability, and death benefits. Retirement benefits are
calculated using 2% of the member’s Average Final Compensation (AFC) times the member’s
years of service – up to a maximum of 60%. AFC is the average of the member’s two
consecutive highest-paid fiscal years.
Members are eligible for retirement at any age after 30 years of service, at the age of 60 with
five years of service, or at the age of 55 with 25 years of service. Other benefits include
temporary and permanent disability payments, an optional cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).
TRS Plan 2/3 provides retirement, disability and death benefits. Retirement benefits for Plan
2 are calculated using 2% of the member’s Average Final Compensation (AFC) times the

Page 32
Packet page 158 of 181

member’s years of service. Retirement defined benefits for Plan 3 are calculated using 1% of
AFC times the member’s years of service. AFC is the monthly average of the member’s 60
consecutive highest-paid service credit months. TRS Plan 2/3 has no cap on years of service
credit.
Members are eligible for retirement with a full benefit at age 65 with at least five years of
service credit. Retirement before age 65 is considered an early retirement. TRS Plan 2/3
members who have at least 20 years of service credit and are 55 years of age or older are
eligible for early retirement with a reduced benefit. The benefit is reduced by a factor that
varies according to age for each year before age 65. TRS Plan 2/3 retirement benefits are
actuarially reduced to reflect the choice of a survivor benefit.
Other TRS Plan 2/3 benefits include a Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) based on the
Consumer Price Index, capped at 3% annually.
Annuities purchased with plan 3 defined contributions that are invested within the WSIB TAP
are considered defined benefits. Plan 3 WSIB TAP annuities are actuarially reduced if a
survivor benefit is chosen and TAP annuities include a COLA of 3% annually.
TRS Plan 3 defined contribution benefits are totally dependent on employee contributions
and investment earnings on those contributions. Members are eligible to withdraw their
defined contribution upon separation. Members have multiple withdrawal options, including
purchase of an annuity.
PERS Plan Information
PERS was established in 1947, and its retirement benefit provisions are contained in Chapters
41.34 and 41.40 RCW. PERS is a cost-sharing, multiple-employer retirement system. PERS
Plan 1 provides retirement, disability, and death benefits. Retirement benefits are
determined as 2% times the member’s Average Final Compensation (AFC) times the
member’s years of services. AFC is the average of the member’s 24 highest consecutive
service months. Members are eligible for retirement from active status at any age with at
least 30 years of service, at age 55 with at least 25 years of service, or at age 60 with at least
five years of service.
PERS Plan 1 retirement benefits are actuarially reduced is a survivor benefit is chosen.
Members retiring from inactive status before age 65 may also receive actuarially reduced
benefits. Other benefits include an optional Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA).
SERS Plan Information
SERS was established by the legislature in 1998, and the plan became effective in 2000. SERS
retirement benefit provisions are established in Chapters 41.34 and 41.35 RCW. SERS
members include classified employees of school districts and educational service districts.

Page 33
Packet page 159 of 181

SERS is a cost-sharing, multiemployer retirement system comprised of two separate plans for
membership purposes. SERS Plan 2 is a defined benefit plan and SERS Plan 3 is a defined
benefit plan with a defined contribution component.
Although members can only be a member of either Plan 2 or Plan 3, the defined benefit
portions of Plan 2 and Plan 3 are accounted for in the same pension trust fund. All assets of
this Plan 2/3 defined benefit plan may legally be used to pay the defined benefits of any of
the Plan 2 or Plan 3 members or beneficiaries. Therefore, Plan 2/3 is a single plan for
accounting purposes.
SERS provides retirement, disability, and death benefits. Retirement benefits for Plan 2 are
calculated as 2% times the member’s Average Final Compensation (AFC) times the member’s
years of service. Defined benefits for Plan 3 are calculated using 1% times the member’s AFC
times the member’s years of service. AFC is the monthly average of the member’s 60
consecutive highest-paid service credit months.
Members are eligible for retirement with a full benefit at age 65 with at least five years of
service credit. Retirement before age 65 is considered an early retirement. SERS members
who have at least 20 years of service credit and are 55 years of age or older are eligible for
early retirement with a reduced benefit. The benefit is reduced by a factor that varies
according to age for each year before age 65.
SERS Plan 2/3 retirement benefits are actuarially reduced if a survivor benefit is chosen.
Other SERS Plan 2/3 benefits include a Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) based on the
Consumer Price Index, capped at 3% annually.
SERS 3 defined contributions benefits are totally dependent on employee contributions and
the investment earnings on those contributions. Annuities purchased with plan 3 defined
contributions that are invested within the WSIB TAP are considered defined benefits. Plan 3
WSIB TAP annuities are actuarially reduced if a survivor benefit is chosen and TAP annuities
include a 3% annually.

Plan Contributions
The employer contribution rates for PERS, TRS, and SERS (Plans 1, 2, and 3) and the TRS and
SERS Plan 2 employee contribution rates are established by the Pension Funding Council based
upon the rates set by the Legislature. The methods used to determine the contribution
requirements are established under state statue in accordance with Chapters 41.40 and 41.45
RCW for PERS, Chapters 41.35 and 41.45 RCW for SERS, and Chapters 41.32 and 41.45 RCW for
TRS. Employers do not contribute to the defined contribution portions of TRS Plan 3 or SERS
Plan 3. Under current law the employer must contribute 100 percent of the employer-required
contribution. The employee contribution rate for Plan 1 in PERS and TRS is set by statute at six
percent and does not vary from year to year.

Page 34

The School District’s Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability (Asset)
At June 30, 2023, the school district reported a total liability of $4,354,022 for its proportionate
shares of the individual plans’ collective net pension liability and $634,450 for its proportionate
shares of net pension assets. Proportions of net pension amounts are based on annual
contributions for each of the employers participating in the DRS administered plans. At June 30,
2023 the district’s proportionate share of each plan’s net pension liability is reported below:

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liabilities for TRS 1, TRS 2/3, PERS 1 and SERS 2/3 were determined by
actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022, with the results rolled forward to June 30, 2023, using the
following actuarial assumptions, applied to all prior periods included in the measurement:
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment rate of return

2.75% total economic inflation, 3.25% salary inflation
In addition to the base 3.25% salary inflation assumption, salaries
are also expected to grow by promotions and longevity.
7.00%

Mortality Rates
Mortality rates used in the plans were developed using the Society of Actuaries’ Pub.H-2010
Mortality rates, which vary by member status as the base table. OSA applies age offsets for each
system to better tailor the mortality rates to the demographics of each plan. OSA applied the
long-term MP-2017 generational improvement scale to project mortality rates for every year
after the 2010 base table. The actuarial assumptions used in the June 30, 2022, valuation were
based on the results of the 2013–2018 Demographic Experience Study Report and the 2021
Economic Experience Study. Additional assumptions for subsequent events and law changes are
current as of the 2022 actuarial valuation report.
Long-term Expected Rate of Return
OSA selected a 7.00% long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments using a
building-block method. In selecting the assumptions, OSA reviewed the historical experience
data, considered the historical conditions that produced past annual investment returns, and
considered Capital Market Assumptions (CMAs) and simulated expected investment returns the
Washington State Investment Board (WSIB) provided.
The CMAs contain three pieces of information for each class of assets the WSIB currently invest
in:
 Expected annual return
 Standard deviation of the annual return
 Correlations between the annual returns of each asset class with every other asset class

Page 36
Packet page 162 of 181

WSIB uses the CMAs and their target asset allocation to simulate future investment returns over
various time horizons.
The expected future rates of return are developed by the WSIB for each major asset class.
Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
pension plans’ target asset allocation as of June 30, 2021, are summarized in the following table:

The inflation component used to create the above table was 2.20% and represents WSIB’s longterm estimate of broad economic inflation consistent with their 2021 CMAs.
Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00%. To determine the
discount rate, an asset sufficiency test was completed to test whether the pension plan’s
fiduciary net position was sufficient to make all projected future benefit payments of current
plan members.
Based on the assumptions described in the DRS Certification Letter, the pension plan’s fiduciary
net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of
current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return, a 7.00% on pension
plan investments was applied to determine the total pension liability or (asset).

Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability (Asset) to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following table presents the Steilacoom Historical School District’s proportionate share of
the collective net pension liability or asset calculated using the discount rate of 7.00%, as well as
what the net pension liability or asset would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is
1 percentage-point lower (6.00%) or 1 percentage-point higher (8.00%) than the current rate.
Amounts are calculated using the school district’s specific allocation percentage, by plan, to
determine the proportionate share of the collective net pension liability or asset.

NOTE 5: ANNUAL OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT COST AND
NET OPEB OBLIGATIONS
The state, through the Health Care Authority (HCA), administers a defined benefit other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plan that is not administered through a qualifying trust. The Public
Employees Benefits Board (PEBB), created within the HCA, is authorized to design benefits, and
determine the terms and conditions of employee and retired employee participation and
coverage, including establishment of eligibility criteria for both active and retired employees.
Benefits purchased by PEBB include medical, dental, life insurance and long-term disability
insurance. (5).
The relationship between the PEBB OPEB plan and its member employers and their employees
and retirees is not formalized in a contract or plan document. Rather, the benefits are provided
in accordance with a substantive plan. A substantive plan is one, which the employers and plan
members understand the plan terms. This understanding is based on communications between

Page 38
Packet page 164 of 181

the HCA, employers and plan members, and historical pattern of practice with regards to sharing
of benefit costs.
Employers participating in the plan include the state of Washington (which includes general
government agencies and higher education institutions), political subdivisions and tribal
governments. Additionally, the PEBB plan is available to the retirees of the K–12 school districts
and ESDs. The District’s seventy-one (71) retirees are eligible to participate in the PEBB plan
under this arrangement.
Eligibility
District members are eligible for retiree medical benefits after becoming eligible for service
retirement pension benefits (either reduced or full pension benefits) Under PERS 1, 2, 3; TRS 1, 2,
or 3; or SERS 2 and 3 plans.
Former members who are entitled to a deferred vested pension benefit are not eligible to
receive medical and life insurance benefits after pension benefit commencement. Survivors of
covered members who die are eligible for medical benefits.
Medical Benefits
Upon retirement, members are permitted to receive medical benefits. Retirees pay the following
monthly rates for pre-65 medical coverage for 2023.
Members not eligible for Medicare

Funding Policy
The School Employees Benefits Board (SEBB) Program administers health insurance and other
benefits to all employees in school districts and charter schools, and union-represented
employees of educational service districts in Washington. The SEBB studies, designs, and
approves comprehensive and cost-effective insurance benefit plans for school employees and
establishes eligibility criteria for participation in these plans. The SEB Board is separate and
independent from the Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB).
The funding policy is based upon pay-as-you go financing.
The SEBB collects benefit premiums from all school district entities for covered employees. The
premium includes a fee, established in state law. The purpose of this fee is to cover the impact
of the subsidized rate of health care benefits for school retirees who elect to purchase their
health care benefits through the state Health Care Authority PEBB plan. The amount collected is
set forth in the state’s operating budget and is subject to change on an annual basis. This
amount is not actuarially determined and is not placed in a trust to pay the obligations for postemployment health care benefits.
For the fiscal year 2022-23, the Steilacoom Historical School District paid $4,429,242 in total to
HCA-SEBB.
The District has no control over the benefits offered to retirees, the rates charged to retirees, nor
the fee paid to the Health Care Authority. The District does not determine its annual required

Page 40
Packet page 166 of 181

contribution, nor the net other post-employment benefit obligation associated with this plan.
These amounts are not shown on the financial statements.
For further information on the results of the actuarial valuation of the employer provided
subsidies associated with the state’s PEBB plan, refer to the Office of the State Actuary.
The plan does not issue a separate report; however, additional information is included in the
State of Washington Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which is available on the OFM
website

NOTE 11: ENTITY RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
The district is a member of the Washington Schools Risk Management Pool (WSRMP). Chapter
48.62 RCW authorizes the governing body of any one or more governmental entities to form
together into or join a pool or organization for the joint purchasing of insurance, and/or joint
self-insuring, and/or joint hiring or contracting for risk management services to the same extent
that they may individually purchase insurance, self-insure, or hire or contract for risk
management services. An agreement to form a pooling arrangement was made pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 39.34 RCW, the Interlocal Cooperation Act. WSRMP was formed in 1986
when educational service districts and school districts in the state of Washington joined by
signing the Cooperative Risk Management Pool Account Agreement (Account Agreement) to
pool their self- insured losses and jointly purchase insurance and administrative services. Over
90 school and educational service districts have joined WSRMP.
WSRMP allows members to jointly purchase insurance coverage, establish a plan of selfinsurance, and provide related services, such as risk management. WSRMP provides the
following coverages for its members: property, liability, vehicle, school board liability, crime,
employment practices, errors and omissions, equipment breakdown, cyber security, crisis/active
shooter coverage, and stop gap liability.

Page 43
Packet page 169 of 181

Members make an annual contribution to fund WSRMP. WSRMP purchases reinsurance and
excess insurance from unrelated carriers subject to a per-occurrence self-insured retention of $1
million for property risk $2M for liability risk shared by WSRMP. Reinsurance or Excess carriers
cover losses over the self-insured retention to the maximum limits of each Coverage Agreement.
Since WSRMP is a cooperative program, there is a joint liability among the participating
members.
Members contract to remain in WSRMP for a minimum of three years and must give notice
three years before terminating participation. The Account Agreement is renewed automatically
each year after the initial three-year period. Even after termination, a member is still responsible
for their share of contributions to WSRMP for any unresolved, unreported, and in-process claims
for the period in which they were a signatory to the Account Agreement. For the year ending
August 31, 2023, the District made payments to WSRMP in the amount of $501,871.
WSRMP is fully funded by its member participants and is governed by a board of directors that
consists of one designated representative from each participating member. An executive board
is elected at the annual meeting and is responsible for overseeing the business affairs of
WSRMP.
Worker’s Compensation: In fiscal year ending August 2022, the district made payments
totaling $252,911 to the Puget Sound Workers’ Compensation Trust, which administers claims
on behalf of several local school districts. This fund is operated for the district's benefit in-lieu-of
the district having to make monthly premium payments to the State of Washington for
industrial insurance, thus minimizing the district’s cost.
Unemployment Compensation: The district is self-insured for unemployment benefits and
reimburses the State of Washington Employment Security for benefits paid on behalf of the
district. During 2021-22 the district made no contribution to the district’s reserve account. The
district’s claims were managed by Puget Sound ESD from our reserve account.
The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and
destruction of assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; and natural disasters.

NOTE 12: PROPERTY TAXES
Property tax revenues are collected as the result of special levies passed by the voters in the
District. Taxes are levied on January 1. The taxpayer has the obligation of paying all taxes on
April 30 or one-half then and one-half on October 31. Typically, slightly more than half of the
collections are made on the April 30 date. The tax collections occurring after the end of the fiscal
period are unavailable for revenue accrual. Therefore, the fall portion of property taxes is not
accrued as revenue. Instead, the property taxes due after the end of the fiscal period are
recorded as a deferred inflow of resources.

Page 44
Packet page 170 of 181

NOTE 13: JOINT VENTURES AND JOINTLY GOVERNED
ORGANIZATIONS
The District is a member of the King County Director’s Association (KCDA). KCDA is a purchasing
cooperative designed to pool the member districts’ purchasing power. The board authorized
joining the association on December 1, 1971 and has remained in the joint venture ever since.
The District’s current equity of $30,608 is the accumulation of the annual assignment of KCDA’s
operating surplus based upon the percentage derived from KCDA’s total sales to the District
compared to all other districts applied against paid administrative fees. The District may
withdraw from the joint venture and will receive its equity in ten annual allocations of
merchandise or 15 annual payments.

The board of directors has established a minimum fund balance policy for the general fund to
provide for financial stability and contingencies within the District. The policy is that the District
shall maintain 6% of prior year general fund expenditures. For the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school
year, the district board of directors voted to suspend that policy.

NOTE 15: TERMINATION BENEFITS
Compensated Absences
Employees earn sick leave at a rate of 12 days per year up to a maximum of one contract year.
Under the provisions of RCW 28A.400.210, sick leave accumulated by District employees is
reimbursed at death or retirement at the rate of one day for each four days of accrued leave,
limited to 180 accrued days. This chapter also provides for an annual buyout of an amount up to
the maximum annual accumulation of 12 days. For buyout purposes, employees may
accumulate such leave to a maximum of 192 days, including the annual accumulation, as of
December 31 of each year.
These expenditures are recorded when paid, except termination sick leave that is accrued upon
death, retirement, or upon termination provided the employee is at least 55 years of age and
has sufficient years of service. Vested sick leave was computed using the termination payment
method.

STEILACOOM HISTORICAL SCHOOL DISTRICT
SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS
FOR YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2023
NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS
NOTE 1—BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
This Schedule is prepared on the same basis of accounting as the district’s financial. The district uses the
modified accrual basis of accounting. Expenditures represent only the federally funded portions of the
program. District records should be consulted to determine amounts expended or matched from non‐
federal sources.
NOTE 2—FEDERAL DE MINIMIS INDIRECT RATE
The district has not elected to use the 10‐percent de minimis indirect cost rate allowed under the
Uniform Guidance. The district used the federal indirect rates as calculated by the Office of
Superintendent of Public Instruction as applicable for each grant.
NOTE – 3—TRANSFERABILITY
As allowed by federal regulations, the district elected to transfer program funds. The district expended
$26,477 from its Title IV, Part A Student Support and Academic Enrichment Program (84.424) on
allowable activities of the Title I, Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies (84.010). This amount is
reflected in the expenditures of Title I, Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies (84.010).
NOTE 4—PROGRAM COSTS/MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS
The amounts shown as current year expenses represent only the federal award portion of the program
costs. Entire program costs, including the district’s local matching share, may be more than shown. Such
expenditures are recognized following, the cost principles contained in Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal
Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements
for Federal Awards, wherein certain types of expenditures are not allowable or are limited as to
reimbursement.

ABOUT THE STATE AUDITOR’S OFFICE
The State Auditor’s Office is established in the Washington State Constitution and is part of the
executive branch of state government. The State Auditor is elected by the people of Washington
and serves four-year terms.
We work with state agencies, local governments and the public to achieve our vision of increasing
trust in government by helping governments work better and deliver higher value.
In fulfilling our mission to provide citizens with independent and transparent examinations of how
state and local governments use public funds, we hold ourselves to those same standards by
continually improving our audit quality and operational efficiency, and by developing highly
engaged and committed employees.
As an agency, the State Auditor’s Office has the independence necessary to objectively perform
audits, attestation engagements and investigations. Our work is designed to comply with
professional standards as well as to satisfy the requirements of federal, state and local laws. The
Office also has an extensive quality control program and undergoes regular external peer review
to ensure our work meets the highest possible standards of accuracy, objectivity and clarity.
Our audits look at financial information and compliance with federal, state and local laws for all
local governments, including schools, and all state agencies, including institutions of higher
education. In addition, we conduct performance audits and cybersecurity audits of state agencies
and local governments, as well as state whistleblower, fraud and citizen hotline investigations.
The results of our work are available to everyone through the more than 2,000 reports we publish
each year on our website, www.sao.wa.gov. Additionally, we share regular news and other
information via an email subscription service and social media channels.
We take our role as partners in accountability seriously. The Office provides training and technical
assistance to governments both directly and through partnerships with other governmental support
organizations.

Exit Conference: Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1
The Office of the Washington State Auditor’s vision is increased trust in government. Our mission is to provide

develop strategies that make government more efficient and effective.
The purpose of this meeting is to share the results of your audit and our draft reporting. We value and appreciate

for a smooth audit process. We appreciate his positive approach to the audit process and the time he dedicated to
the audit.
Recommendations not included in the Audit Reports

We have provided exit recommendations for management’s consideration. Exit items address control deficiencies
or noncompliance with laws or regulation that have an insignificant or immaterial effect on the entity, or errors
with an immaterial effect on the financial statements. Exit items are not referenced in the audit report.
Financial Statement Audit Communication
We would like to bring the following to your attention:
•

We did not identify any material misstatements during the audit.

•

Uncorrected misstatements in the audited financial statements are listed below. We agree with
management’s representation that these misstatements are immaterial to the fair presentation of the
financial statements. However, the conditions that led to these misstatements may result in more
significant misstatements if not corrected.
o The District reported $37,556 as unavailable revenue in the ASB fund that should be reported as
unearned revenue.

o The District did not report the $4 million bond refunding transaction on the Schedule of LongTerm Liabilities. As a result, both the amount issued and amount redeemed are underreported by
this amount.
The audit addressed the following risks, which required special consideration:
o Due to the possibility that management may be able to circumvent certain controls, standards
require the auditor to assess the risk of management override.
