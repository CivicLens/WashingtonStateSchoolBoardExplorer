Consent
Items listed under the Consent Calendar are considered to be routine and are acted on by the Board of
Directors in one motion. There is no discussion of these items before the board vote unless a member of
the board, staff, or public requests specific items be discussed and/or removed from the Consent
Calendar. It is understood that the administration recommends approval on all consent Items. Each item
on the Consent Calendar approved by the board shall be deemed to have been considered in full and
adopted as recommended.Consent VotingA consent agenda is a group of routine or procedural items for
which there is general consensus among members of the governing body. Generally, a vote is taken on
the entire package without discussion to help the governing body conduct its business more efficiently.
Moderators can take consent votes with either the manual or online voting method (see the related
documents Recording Manual Votes and Recording Online Votes). A single vote is recorded for all items
with a type of Action (Consent) regardless of whether the items are organized together or distributed
throughout the agenda. In accordance with standard parliamentary procedure, moderators can only take
one consent vote during a meeting. When saving the consent vote, moderators will be prompted to
confirm voting for all items with the Action (Consent) type in a message window that appears.
