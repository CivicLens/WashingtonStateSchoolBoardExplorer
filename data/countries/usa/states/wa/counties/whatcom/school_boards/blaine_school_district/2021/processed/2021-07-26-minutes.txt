  2. Public Comment
A. Public Comment
Dan Persse addressed the board briefly on the topic of the district's budget development and distributed hard copies of a detailed email he sent earlier to each director.
  3. Reports
A. Budget Status and Financial Report
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of June. She described how the district's precaution of conservative spending has resulted in a higher-than-normal fund balance. Decreased enrollment also resulted in lower-than-normal revenue. Ms. Porter explained that the draft budget's preparation was delayed due to a family emergency, and the directors expressed their appreciation for her efforts in budget development.

Ms. Porter provided additional explanation about the 4-year budget projection which is provided with the draft budget pursuant to state law. Any budget deficit or negative fund balance shown by the projection of current trends would be addressed in the future by making budgetary adjustments. Anticipated future revenue loss will certainly impact the district's ability to continue current programming. Although the board must adopt the 4-year projection as part of the budget, there is no obligation to follow that projection.
  B. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Summer 2021: Work is ongoing in preparation for all students returning to full-time learning. A collaborative retreat is scheduled for the administrative team for the week of August 2.
Budget Planning: A Public Hearing and board action on the 2021-2022 budget will take place at next month's meeting. The budgeted enrollment level is based upon existing enrollment, but there continues to be uncertainty regarding how families will respond to the conflicting health authority guidance related to COVID safety protocols. There was discussion regarding students whose families had expressed a preference for online education in the spring survey.
2021-2022: The district is still waiting for school-specific guidance from the Washington State Department of Health.
Policy Updates: There are several policy updates on this meeting's agenda which address new requirements going into effect for the 2021-2022 school year.
Board Meetings: Year-End and Coming-Year presentations by principals will be combined in the future, starting in August 2022. Therefore, the board will take action later in this meeting to adjust the board meeting calendar.
