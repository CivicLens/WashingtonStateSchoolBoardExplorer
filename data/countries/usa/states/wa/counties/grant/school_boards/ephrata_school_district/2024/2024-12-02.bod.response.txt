community to four year terms. The purpose of a regular School Board meeting is to allow the Board to conduct school business in an open forum. A time for public comment occurs at regularly scheduled Board of Education meetings to provide an opportunity for individuals to address the board regarding district issues. The Ephrata School Board welcomes civil, respectful statements and clear, concise communications that inform its deliberations. The Board uses the public comment period as an opportunity to listen to citizen concerns, but not to debate issues or enter into a question-and-answer session. Public comment allows the Board and Superintendent to hear issues that interest our community. It is not a time for dialogue between the speaker, Board or Superintendent. Public Comment Guidance Individuals that wish to comment during a Board meeting must fill out the Public Comment Form below. Individual comments must be less than three minutes in duration. Each speaker is limited to one speaking opportunity on a given subject during a single meeting. Comments about specific staff members will not be accepted in this forum. Comments regarding staff members, whether positive or negative, are best delivered in writing. Please review Board Policy 4420, which explains the procedure for resolving a concern about a staff member. Comments about ethnicity and/or the character or motives of individuals will not be tolerated. The Board President may, at his/her discretion, interrupt, warn or terminate public commentary if it interferes with the orderly conduct of the meeting or does not adhere to the above parameters.
