Lynden/Ferndale International Masonic Lodge representatives, Troy Luginbill, Everett Thompson, and Dick Decima, attended the meeting and presented Blaine Middle School Teacher Susan Alexander with the 2020-2021 Educator of the Year award for Blaine School District.
  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Reports
School administrators reviewed their written reports. Director Lotze asked about Terre Shapiro's new STEAM teaching assignment which Jordan Radke confirmed will be full time. Craig Baldwin provided an updated Move-a-thon fundraising total of more than $2,000. Director Nunamaker asked about the elementary school's yearbook which was provided by the PTO, and discussion followed.
  B. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment through the month of May which increased slightly but remained at 73 FTE below budget. She does not expect June's count to have much impact on the overall average.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of April, including a revenue spike resulting from spring tax revenue collection. Lower activity levels and costs have resulted in the district ending this unusual year on strong financial footing. Expenditures in April included insurance payments. Director Lotze asked if the district had received stimulus funding yet, and Ms. Porter explained what has been received already. The district has not yet claimed any ESSER 2 or ESSER 3 dollars which all remain available as reimbursements.
  D. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Summer Planning: Resources in math and literacy will be provided for families. A summer workout program will be offered for student athletes. A schedule of community access times for the stadium and track will be made available.
Staffing: Dr. Granger explained new positions that will provide increased support to families and resources for students.
Budget Planning: Considerations continue to include uncertain enrollment, various staffing needs, and the outcome of collective bargaining.
2021-2022 Planning: The district's recovery plan is due to OSPI by June 1st and will be submitted after this meeting. Due to very little interest in an online-only option, there will not be a teacher allocated for this purpose, and all students will receive in-person instruction next year. Director Nunamaker asked about expectations for online preference and discussion continued. The district will work to meet the needs of those few families who require online instruction due to extenuating circumstances.
No Charge Meals: Thanks to a federal grant, all students will be eligible for no charge meals in 2021-2022.
2021 WSSDA Conference: The directors were encouraged to RSVP for attendance at this year's conference which will be held in person November 18-21 in Bellevue.
Upcoming Event: Dr. Granger will hold a Community Q&A session on June 7 at 6:00 p.m. Director Nunamaker was invited to attend and observe.
