Lynden Middle School will be holding their first Math Fun Night on December 13th. The goal is to get
parents involved in hands on math with their sons and daughters and to provide information about the new
math materials. Dinner will be served and all are invited to attend.
Lynden Middle School Counselor's began a project called "Start the Ripple". Students use their hand prints
to be creative and capture the simple ways they can spread respect and kindness to one another. The
project is hanging on the walls of the cafeteria for all to enjoy and be inspired!
Lynden Academy's ALE audit has been completed by the State Auditors Office and it was determined that
all documentation was in compliance and they appreciated the efforts of all involved.
Lynden Academy is grateful for their larger space and the many hands that made it happen. They look
forward to the gym that is in the works.
Lynden High School Ag Tech was awarded a $3,500 grant from Northwest Farm for the use towards
biotech curriculum.
