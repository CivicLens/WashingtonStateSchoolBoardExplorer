3. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
3.01 Discuss goals and options for hiring an interim superintendent for the 2021-2022 school
year
Mr. McLaurin reminded the Board that at the March 9 Special Meeting they decided not
to conduct a search for a superintendent to begin on July 1, 2021. He noted that the
primary reason for that is timing; it is a short window of time and the Board felt that if
they appointed an interim superintendent for a period of time they could conduct a full
search, which would allow them to obtain input from the community and staff. Mr.
McLaurin said tonight the Board will discuss the pros and cons of appointing an internal
candidate verses external candidate for an interim superintendent.
Mr. McLaurin asked the Board to discuss the attributes they are looking for in an interim.
Dr. Faye Britt took notes. Some of the attributes mentioned are:
•
•

Strong community relations
Re-establish connections with bringing students back into school

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Strong focus on education
Work well with others
Superintendent credentials or requirement on job description
Someone with experience (in an interim situation)
Good communicator
Someone that knows the culture or is willing to learn the cultures
Someone that knows the history of the district and what is going on now
Someone that can merit the respect of teachers and community
Avoid someone that would come in with big, grand ideas
The Board does not want to go through a lot of change this year and again next
year.
Someone that is comfortable coming in and keeping us steady and focused on
what we need to do this coming year.
Keep track of administrative tasks that are getting done
Someone with humility and fast to adapt
Someone that understands our policy governance since we do have a unique
governance culture
Someone that does not want to be the full time superintendent. It puts the Board in
a position of being questioned by the community if they hire the interim
superintendent for the superintendent position.

Mr. McLaurin asked Executive Director of Human Resources Mr. John Fairbairn to share
the attributes that the executive team is looking for in an interim superintendent. Mr.
Fairbairn noted the following:
• It is the Board’s decision and the executive team will support the decision
• Highly knowledgeable about the district’s strengths/needs
• Well known to current staff
• Maintaining the important work (construction, governance, COVID, reopening)
• Someone we don’t have to train since it is 1 year or less
• Recognize difficult budget situations (knowledge there is important)
• Levy campaign
• The community needs to know that their input is heard and valued in the hiring
process of the superintendent. If the interim became the superintendent, it makes
it challenging for the candidate, as they appear to be the favorite since they were
appointed.
The Board discussed the pros and cons of an internal versus external interim.
•

Internal plus:
o Knowledge of what is going on in the district
o Grow your own; they know the curriculum, budget, and what needs to be
done.
o They know the community.
o Promotion for someone internally

•
•

•

o We know the track record of how they work with the team. For a short-term
position, how that person interacts with those already in place is a crucial
factor.
Internal Negative:
o Domino effect of back filling
o Always done it this way scenario
External plus:
o Someone could come in with fresh eyes; different ways to look at things
o The district has a good plan in place and a strong team. There may be many
candidates to choose from that have superintendent experience.
External negative:
o Vetting process for an external interim would be challenging

Mr. McLaurin asked since we have policy OE-2 for Succession do we want to exercise
our ability to appoint an interim, or do we want to have a process for people to apply?
Mr. McLaurin reminded the Board that they are charged with coming up with the best
person that they can identify for an interim superintendent who has the long list of
experience and expertise that they are looking for.
The Board discussed the options of conducting an external interim search versus
appointing an internal interim superintendent.
Melinda Cool made a motion to do an external search for an interim superintendent
Final Resolution: Motion does not carry
Yea: Melinda Cool
Opposed: Kevin Erickson, Jessie Deardorff, Lee Anne Riddle, Andrew McLaurin
