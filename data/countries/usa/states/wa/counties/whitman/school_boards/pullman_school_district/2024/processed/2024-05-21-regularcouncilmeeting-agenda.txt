Recommended Action :

By motion, accept the quote of Fisher Systems for the
Police Facility Access Control Panel Conversion and
Upgrade for $51,963.28 plus the additional monthly fee of
$210.

Public Content
There is an immediate need for a conversion of an outdated relay control panel that
controls locking and unlocking doors in and out of the jail sally port area, lobby area,
and the secure holding/jail area off the control room. Upgrade to existing badge
access control panels throughout the facility from WinPak 2003 to Brivo, a cloudsupported SaaS used and supported in other city-owned facilities. Updating the
facility will allow control of all doors from one web-based control panel and
permission-based user access controls. The existing WinPak 2003 interface runs off
a local Windows Server 2003 instance that is eight (8) years out of support and nonupgradeable. There is no recovery option in the event of hardware or software failure,
and the server instance is a significant cyber-security liability, as security-related fixes
also stopped with the end of support for that platform. This upgrade was approved in
the CIP process. The quote/contract from Fisher Systems for the replacement of the
control panel is $51,963.28, with a monthly service fee of $210.00.

Recommended Action :

Staff recommends approval to enter into a five-year contract
with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources
(DNR) for the mutual response and suppression of wildfire
activities threatening the City of Pullman, the greater
Palouse region, and across Washington State.

Public Content
Fire department staff recommend approval of this five-year contract with DNR for the
response and mitigation of wildfire activities that threaten the City of Pullman and our
neighbors throughout the State of Washington. Following the passage of HB 1498 in
2023, DNR can now offer a variety of firefighting apparatus to aid local resources in
combating an emerging wildfire threat. The available apparatus includes access to
DNR's fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Additional equipment available under this
agreement includes access to DNR's heavy equipment, such as a dozer, which is
highly effective when working in terrain such as our wildland-urban interface. Under
this agreement, all resources sent by DNR during the initial phase of an emerging
incident are at no cost to the City of Pullman.
As specified in the contract, this contract will supersede our existing DNR Interagency
Agreement (Contract No. 93-103824).
Should fire department personnel and equipment respond to a wildfire incident on
DNR property, historic reimbursement mechanisms will remain in place. This includes
covering costs associated with backfilling career staff positions while they are
assigned to an incident.

Recommended Action :

By motion adopt the attached resolution authorizing the
execution of a Washington State DOE Water Quality
Combined Financial Assistance Agreement No. WQC-2024Pullma-00066 for the Pullman Stormwater Decant Facility
project.

Public Content
Design and construction of a new city decant facility has already been approved
through the citys CIP process. The project site is on the east side of Guy Street
across from the Citys Public Works Maintenance and Operations (M&O) campus.
Grading of the site as part of a separate project has been underway since 2022, and
is scheduled to be completed later this summer. Construction of the decant facility will
then follow, most likely in 2025. A decant facility is needed to properly manage the
liquid and solid waste generated from the M&O divisions road and storm drain
cleaning activities, primarily Vactor truck and street sweeper waste, as well as some
sanitary sewer maintenance and operations. Currently, the project is at a 90% design
level, which was partially funded through a DOE grant.
In September 2022, staff submitted a separate grant application to the Washington
State DOEs Stormwater Financial Assistance Program to help fund construction of
the new facility. This grant submittal was approved by Council on September 27,
2022 with Resolution R-59-22.
Later, in June 2023, the City received notice that the project was selected by DOE for
water quality funding. The DOE grant agreement has since been finalized and is
ready for Council acceptance. Once executed, staff will begin the process to finalize
the design plans and specifications so the project can be bid this winter and
constructed in 2025. The cost to complete this work is estimated at $1,755,000.
There is a 15% local match requirement ($263,250) for this grant which will be
provided bythe Stormwater budget ($184,275) and the Sewer budget of the Utility
Fund ($78,975). The remaining project costs ($1,491,750) will be provided by the
DOE agreement. This project is in line with the goals of the citys Stormwater
Management Program, and supports implementation of the citys NPDES Municipal
Stormwater Permit.

Public Content
City staff are seeking partial funding for the Pullman Veterans Memorial Parkthrough
a state grant opportunity.
The Washington Wildlife and Recreation Program (WWRP) provides funding for a
broad range of land protection and outdoor recreation, serving the goals ofacquiring
valuable recreation and habitat lands before they are lost to other uses and
developing recreation areas for a growing population. This legislation was passed in
1990, and continued funding has been supported by governors, the Legislature, and
groups like the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition. The program is one of
many competitive grants administered by the Washington State Recreation and
Conservation Office (RCO).
WWRP has several categories, each with different allocated funding. City staff
prepared an application for the Local Parks Category and submitted it on May 1st.
The funding request is for the development and construction of Pullman Veterans
Memorial Park (Phase 1) at 435 SE Fairmount Drive, adjacent to the City Cemetery.
The City purchased the land for this purpose in 2022. The park and its central
features will be open and available to the public at the completion of Phase 1.
Staff requested $500,000, which is the maximum grant award amount. The City will
be responsible for the rest of the project cost, which is estimated at roughly $2 million.
If selected, the City will need to certify the availability of the remaining funds at least
one month prior to approval of grant funding, which is anticipated to be in early
Summer 2025.
Currently, American Legion Post 52 is leading a fundraising campaign to secure
donations and community contributions. The ability to accept a potential RCO grant
award is dependent on successful fundraising and the ability to provide the rest of the
project costs.In the case that the project is selected for an award and the rest of the
funds have been secured, staff will return to the Council next summer regarding
certification of funding and a grant agreement.
The initial application was due May 1, and a technical review process is underway.
Staff will receive feedback and suggestions for changes and then must resubmit by
the Technical Completion Deadline, July 18, 2024. Staff will also give a virtual
presentation to an evaluation team for project scoring this August.The Authorizing
Resolution / Application Authorization is due with the July 18 resubmission, which is
the reason for this agenda item. The attached Resolution uses the required text
provided by RCO.Staff is requesting the Council's adoption of the attached resolution,
authorizing the application and naming persons authorized to execute documents.
Park design plans and information about donating is available online at this link:

can develop and implement plans, goals, and policies that build community-wide
climate resilience. The Model Climate Element provides different pathways for
communities that have done some or limited climate planning. The Planning Division

(Planning) had meetings with Commerce every two weeks, working through the
Model Climate Element Guidelines, assisting with providing current plans for an audit,
and working with the Consultants (Cascadia Consulting Group and Berk Consulting,
Inc.) on the Guidance Workbook. Instead of creating a new Climate Element, the City
opted to add climate resiliency language throughout the current Comprehensive Plan.
The Consultants created maps showing Vulnerability and Risk Assessments and
proposed language changes and updates to the current Comprehensive Plan.
In March 2023, the Planning Commission started reviewing the proposed changes; in
April, the Commission requested to postpone continuing review until the new
Environmental Resilience Commission (ERC) reviewed the proposed changes. The
ERC started reviewing the proposed changes in September 2023, at their meeting on
March 1, 2024 they completed the review of the changes and voted unanimously to
send the changes to the Planning Commission for final recommendation to City
Council. Per RCW 35A.63.070 and Pullman City Code 17.110.020 and 17.180.030, a
public hearing is required before a recommendation is forwarded to the City Council.
The Planning Commission reviewed the changes during a public hearing during their
regularly scheduled meeting on March 27, 2024, and voted unanimously to forward a
recommendation for approval to the City Council.
