Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulgáb).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time immemorial and their

ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice the traditional ways of their
ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural traditions passed on to them by their
ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its Indigenous people,
as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history, and can
demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.

Reports as presented.

Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:

May Budget Reports:
Fund balance and net cash: The beginning fund balance for the 2023-24 year was $3.8 million. As of the end of May 2024, the fund balance
was $126,497.02 (compared to $3.9 million last May 2023) and net cash is approximately $2.4 million (compared to $6.3 million last May
2023). Consistent with prior year trends, fund balance, net cash, and revenues show a large spike in October and April from receipt of a
large portion of local property taxes. The months following these large influxes show declines especially since the state apportionment
allocation in November and May is only 5%, and June is only 6% of the total allocation versus 9% in most of the other months. While it is
consistent with the normal pattern at this time of year, it is at a significantly lower balance across this fiscal year than in prior years.
Expenditures remain at a fairly consistent monthly level. A short-term temporary interfund loan from the Capital Projects was not necessary
for the months of January, February, or March. A short-term temporary interfund loan from Capital Projects was approved by Board
Resolution 24-07 for the month of June. June is the lowest point in the year for fund balance. Projections for July indicate a very narrow
margin in covering current month obligations. Accordingly, an additional interfund loan from Capital Projects will be proposed for approval by
board resolution to be utilized during the month of July and August. This is due to the timing and receipt of revenue accruals for the 2023-24
fiscal year which won't be fully received until the fiscal year is closed.
Current projections estimate that the district will have an ending fund balance of around $1 million (depending on the Safety Net grant award
for special education costs) for the 2023-24 fiscal year. This figure also assumes the District has made repayment of all funds loaned from
the Capital Projects Fund.
Local Tax Revenue: The district has received 98% of total budgeted General Fund tax revenues for the 2023-24 fiscal year. Tax revenues
received year-to-date amount to $9.4 million of the $9.6 million budgeted.
State Apportionment Revenues: The district's State Apportionment allocation is increased since actual average full-time equivalent (FTE)
enrollment is approximately 113 more than budgeted enrollment. In November, the District requested OSPI to adjust the enrollment figure
used to disburse the District's monthly allocation, to a level that would more closely align with the increase in enrollment that the district was
experiencing. This allowed the district to receive needed revenues earlier and supported cash flow levels for November and December. The
amount of the increase becomes more evident with January's apportionment which is when the State makes its annual 'true-up' on its
payments to school districts. January is when the state adjusts from paying school districts based on budgeted average student FTE to
payments based on ACTUAL average student FTE. The remaining increase in apportionment is than spread from January to August. The
overall increase in revenues for additional enrollment is estimated to be between $1-1.3 million dollars.
June Enrollment Report:
The June 2024 enrollment reports are submitted for Board review and approval. Actual enrollment for June 2024 was 5,382.84 FTE (FullTime-Equivalent). June enrollment decreased 23.11 FTE compared to May's enrollment. The average FTE taking into consideration
September through June monthly enrollments is 5,423.28. This is 109.28 FTE more than budgeted enrollment of 5,314.00.
Compared to 2022-23 average enrollment, the district is serving approximately 60 more student FTE in 2023-24 than the year before.

Over the past several years, mental health services were provided to elementary students who would not have received them otherwise.
These mental health counselorsworked continuously with 6-7students each day at all of our elementary schoolsand engagedin several
mental health triage situations. Mental health support has been an increasing need across the District and is identified as a priority for
Arlington students. This year we have the opportunity to have a full-time mental health professional at Weston High School who would be

The district will provide space for this mental health counselor at Weston High School to meet with students, staff, and families, in exchange
for services at no cost to the families. NWESD 189 has a separate agreement with this mental health counselor to reimburse them for
services that cannot be billed, or the difference between insurance reimbursement and cost for service.

Schedule as presented.

Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
In keeping with the provision of an educational program for students as free of costs as possible,Arlington Public Schools Board Policy and
Procedure 3520/3520P provides for the types ofcircumstances and guidelines by which the schools and programs may charge student fees
where appropriate. Board Policy 3510 and 3520 also provide authority and circumstances around waivers for certain fees. Schools and

programs must submit a list of fees for Board approval annually. With the exception of some Associated Student Body (ASB) items or
fundraisers, fees are for supplementary or optional items and are not intended to exceed the costs of the supplies, materials, or services
provided, and/or in the case of fines, are intended to cover replacement of lost or damaged district property or materials. Fees are received
and receipted according to district procedures and proper accounting standards. These procedures are subject to audit on an annual basis.
The district recommends the attached fee schedule for 2024-25. Changes from the previous schedule (in the order they appear on the
schedule) are as follows:
1) Senior Dinner Dance - The Senior Dinner Dance is an Associated Student Body (ASB) optional event, planned and organized by the
students through the ASB. Arlington High School has requested an increase in the price range on the fee schedule to $15-$25 to better
represent the increasing cost of the venue where the senior dance is hosted.
2) Student Learning Device Protection Plan - In order to better offset the increasingly high cost of repairs for district owned student learning
devices, the District Technology Department proposes the increase of the Device Protection Plan (DPP) enrollment fee from $20 to $30, to
increase the cap on replacement cost (if enrolled in the plan) from $50 to $100 (limited to one incident) and to clarify that if enrolled in the
plan, repairs are at no cost, but the repairs are capped at 2 incidents, with the first incident being covered, and the second incident being
covered at 50%.
3) Parking Permits - Arlington High School would like authorization to increase the parking permit fee from $35 to $50, and to change the
parking ticket cost from $15/$25/$35 for 1st/2nd/3rd offense, to $50/$60/$65. This will assist in enforcing and managing the numerous
student vehicles parking at Arlington High School during the day, and for providing an offset to the maintenance and operation of the parking
lot.
4) The Child and Nutrition Services Department recommends an increase of $0.25 for paid full-price student meals and $0.50 for adult
meals, which would go into effect with the 2024-25 school year. These prices arebased on the Child and Nutrition Services Department's
cost analysis and the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI)/federal program analysis guidelines.
5) Traffic Safety Drivers Education Tuition Fee - Per request from the District's Traffic Safety Education Coordinator, the Traffic Safety
Drivers Education Tuition Fee would increase from $625 to $650, the written test fee from $50 to $60, and the drive skills test from $90 to
$100. The changes are requested to cover the increasing costs of staff salaries, gas, maintenance and insurance, and as part of the ongoing
plan to collect enough funds to allow for purchase of an additional drivers education car. This program is provided as a service to students
and families in the community. It is optional and voluntary. The district does not receive any state funding to provide this program. The
program has operated with the assumption that it must be self-supporting. Private companies are also available to provide this class to teens
in the community. Arlington Public Schools' Drivers Education Class is priced in range with what private companies charge, and is a
convenient option for students in Arlington.
Budgetary Impact:

Fees are revenue and typically are considered cost recoveries to defray the costs of ASB activities.
Board Policy 3510 and 3520 provide the authority and circumstances for waiving fees.
Previous Board Action:

The Board approved the 2023-24 Fee Schedule during the July 10, 2023 Board Meeting, and two
amended 2023-24 Fee Schedules during the January 8, 2024 and March 11, 2024 meetings respectively.

E. Resolution 24-10 Interfund Loan

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves Resolution 24-10
Interfund Loan.

Goals :

Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
The District has been carefully tracking cash flow. Previous authorization for an interfund loan provided for up to $2.8 million. The District has
recently accessed approximately $2.6 million of this for the month of June. Projections indicate continued cash shortfalls may be
experienced into the month of July and August. The District is requesting an additional interfund load of up to $1 million so that current
obligations for July and through the end of the fiscal year can be met.
WAC laws 392-123-135 through 160 and the State Accounting Manual for School Districts, allows for temporary interfund loans from the
Capital Projects Fund to the General Fund, provided the loan does not interfere with the operation of the Capital Projects Fund and that the
General Fund pays the amount of interest to the Capital Projects Fund that it would have earned had it remained invested with the County.

Apportionment funding relief will not be received until the end of July and August. Other expected funds such as Safety Net and other grant
revenues will not be received until the end of the month of August, September and even October. The District plans to repay the loan
balance in full by the time the year-end close processes are complete and all revenue accruals have been made for the 2023-24 fiscal year.
Budgetary Impact:
Interest must be paid by the borrowing fund to the loaning fund. The interest rate to be used is the rate the Snohomish County Treasurer
uses for the District's investments during the periods/months of the loan. The estimated loan interest to be paid to the Capital Projects Fund
could be approximately $4,376.70 (Estimated using April's interest rate of 5.325% APR, generates approximately $145.89 per day. If the
entire loan is utilized for 30 days, the cost would be $4,376.70) The amount may change depending on the County's actual interest during
the period as applied to the amount of the loan outstanding, and the payback date(s).
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:
The interfund loan must be authorized by Board Resolution prior to making the loan.
Previous Board Action:
The board approved Resolution 24-02 Interfund Loan during the January 22, 2024 regular board meeting.
The board approved Resolution 24-07 Interfund Loan during the May 28, 2024 regular board meeting.
