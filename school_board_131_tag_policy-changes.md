The Blaine School District No. 503 held a special board meeting on December 7, 2021 to discuss and finalize a redistricting plan for the district. The board had previously met on November 22, 2021, and heard concerns from Birch Bay patrons regarding the initial draft redistricting plan.

The alternate plan was presented at the meeting and received positive feedback from both board members and Birch Bay residents.

The board discussed the benefits of the alternate plan, which included more compact districts within Birch Bay and a clearer alignment with community interests. Concerns were raised about the historical lack of candidates from Birch Bay and the displacement of the current director in District 4 due to the redistricting. It was clarified that the displaced director would be allowed to complete their current term.

The alternate plan was ultimately supported by both the board and the Birch Bay community, with residents expressing appreciation for the district's willingness to listen to their concerns and address them in a constructive manner. The board agreed to further discuss the redistricting plan at their December 14 meeting.

## 2020-01-27 - BLAINE_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The text details a school board meeting where several policy matters were discussed and acted upon. Notably, President Gibson abstained from voting on a facility use payment due to a potential conflict of interest stemming from his previous role as pastor at Northwood Alliance Church. This suggests a proactive effort by the president to avoid any perception of impropriety.

The board also agreed to schedule a meeting with McPherson & Jacobson, the firm that conducted the superintendent search, to establish performance objectives for Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger. This meeting is mandated by the superintendent search contract's two-year guarantee clause.  Finally, the board entered into executive session to review the performance of a public employee, extending the session twice before reconvening and adjourning the meeting.
