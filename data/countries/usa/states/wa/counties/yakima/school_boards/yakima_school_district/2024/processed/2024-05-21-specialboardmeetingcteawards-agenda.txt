YAKAMA LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Today, the schools of the Yakima School District rest on the ancestral lands of the fourteen Confederated Tribes and Bands of the
Yakama Nation. The people of Yakama Nation inhabited more than 12 million acres across Adams, Benton, Chelan, Douglas,
Franklin, Grant, Kittitas, Klickitat, and Yakima counties. Today, we honor those native peoples who are tied to the land through
history, legends, and culture. We acknowledge their descendants who live in the world today.
We thank the caretakers of this land, who have lived here and continue to live here since time immemorial. An acknowledgment is
a simple, powerful way to show respect, and a step toward correcting the stories and practices that erase indigenous peoples
history and culture. It also honors the truth. As a school district, we will continue to build upon our relations with the Yakama
Nation.
