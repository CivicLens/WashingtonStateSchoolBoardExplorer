2. Good News
Family Community Services hosted a successful student school supply distribution day serving 117 families and over 275 students.
The Isom PTA provided $1000 grants last spring to support the library, Music, and PE programs. Mr. Jorgenson, music teacher, used the
funds to purchase materials and built (with his own hands) two Marimbas that are ready for use in 2022-2023.
The personnel action form of staff joining the Lynden School District is expansive and full of celebrations.
Two staff members were recently recognized. Laura Toften received the Lynden Lions Service Award from Lynden High School. Leanne
Van was honored at a recent Seattle Mariner's game having been named a WSECU Teacher of the Week.
Fisher reported that over 90% of their families have attended the originally scheduled parent connection conferences in place for the
youngest learners. The newest little Lions are super excited for school to start!
Partners for Schools has provided the third and final donation of $35,000 toward the 2021-2022 Be The One Mentoring Program. This
fulfills a $105,000 commitment to the partnership with Lynden Schools and the greater community to provide a robust mentoring
program for middle and high school students.
The lead up and start of schools is to be celebrated. The positive energy observed among the students, families, and staff was
noticeable and very encouraging. Good stuff on a lot of levels.
