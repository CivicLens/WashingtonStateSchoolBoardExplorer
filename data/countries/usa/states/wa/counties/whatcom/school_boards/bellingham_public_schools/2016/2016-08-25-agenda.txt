Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
Attached is Resolution 14-16 which approves an increase in expenditures or appropriations and petitions OSPI to make changes to the
district's budget. During the 2015-16 budget process, we built in additional budget capacity for contingencies like staff adjustments needed at
the beginning of the school year for class size reduction and additional support, salary changes resulting from conversations with bargaining
groups that have yet to be finalized, and unexpected needs. During 2015-16, unanticipated revenues allowed the district to enhance
spending on some programs under the contingency program and beyond. Additionalresources came from state and federal sources for title
grants, other grants, special education, vocational programs, food services, and transportation. There were spending increases in many of
these programs. To provide capacity for higher than expected spending of approximately $400,000, the district is asking for an increase in
general fund budget appropriations of $1,000,000 for the 2015-16 school year. The additional capacity will provide assurance that the district
stays within the budget through to August 31, 2016.

2.8 Driveway Easement

Meeting :

Aug 25, 2016 - Regular Board Meeting and
Public Hearing

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the request outlined below for approval of a
driveway easement to a property owner in the Whatcom
Middle School neighborhood. As Superintendent, I have
reviewed and approved this request and am submitting as a
consent item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
At your March 19, 2015 meeting you authorized the granting of a driveway easement for ingress, egress, parking, and utilities to the
owner of a piece of property south of Halleck Street near Whatcom Middle School. The portion of the district-owned parcel impacted by
the easement is located at the far northeastern corner of the paved area south of Whatcom Middle School and is approximately 8 feet
wide and 75 feet long. The original easement area is shown in the attached document titled 'March 2015 Easement Exhibit'.
By way of review, the owner of a home located immediately adjacent to (north of) the parcel has used the proposed easement area on
our property for many years as a driveway(as have previous property owners)and alleges that a prescriptive easement over the parcel
arose prior to the time the district acquired the property in 1961. This matter was thoroughly researched, including legal counsel review,
and it was determined that to be a reasonable conclusion.
The March 2015 easement was never recorded as the owner was unsuccessful in reaching agreement with the city to construct an
additional curb cut required to access the easement area.
The owner is now requesting a small additional area in order to utilize an existing curb cut and is willing to provide additional
compensation for the additional area. See ExhibitC, Easement Area 2, in the attached 'Driveway Easement Final'.Granting the
easement does not impair or alter our use of the property.
The proposed easement is attached for your review.
Board approval of the attached driveway easement is requested.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
As part of the construction of Cordata Elementary School on Aldrich Road we constructed an off-site wetland mitigation area on a 5 acre
parcel on Northwest Drive. This was required in order to mitigate the impact of filling some of the existing wetland on the Cordata
elementary site.
Costco Wholesale is constructing a new warehouse on Bakerview Road. As part of that project they are required to construct a wetland
mitigation area to mitigate the impact of filling some of the existing wetlands on their warehouse site. Costcos mitigation area is located
immediately southof our mitigation area on Northwest Drive. (See Exhibit C in the attached easement document).
Costco is requesting an easement that will allow an unnamed stream on their wetland mitigation area to be directed onto our adjacent
wetland mitigation area as depicted in Exhibit C.
Costcos proposed easement has been reviewed by our wetland consultant (Northwest Environmental Services), the Washington State
Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Washington State Department of Ecology and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; all of whom
support the granting of the easement due to the resulting ecological benefits. The easement was developed with the oversight of our
legal counsel.
All costs associated with developing, granting, and implementing of the easement including consultant fees, legal fees, recording fees,
maintenance and monitoring will be borne solely by Costco. In addition, the District will receive $5,000 compensation for granting the
easement.
The proposed easement is attached for your review.
Board approval of the attached Wetland Mitigation easement is requested.

Explanation of Issue:

ESD 112 isoffering school districts an opportunity to enter into a contractual agreement wherein districts
will pick up the cost of skills testing services for Commercial Driver License (CDL).
Although many testing scenarios were evaluated, the above scenario appeared to best meet the needs of
school districts,examiners, and the industry. Testing at local Licensing Services Offices could be
problematic with lengthy wait times. Testing with independent examiners can work in some situations,
however, it is likely that most independent testers will put school bus driver applicants at the "end of the
line", since those tests generate the least revenue.
