RE: 8th Grade Field Trip to NCI Mountain School
DATE: February 8, 2010
I am writing to request approval for the Greater Yellowstone team of 8th grade students to attend the
North Cascade Institutes Mountain School Field Science and Leadership Program Fisher Case Study.
Pre-planning for this three-day, two-night field trip, during the week of June 9, has included criteria set
forth in District Policy and Procedures (2320) on student trips.
Mountain School Program
The program is designed to connect students to the diverse ecosystems and communities of the national
park through outdoor hands-on, experiential-based education. Students will participate in a hands-on,
field based science investigations project that is studying the fisher, an endangered forest carnivore
found in the North Cascades. Through this experience, students will gain a deeper understanding of the
natural world and the importance of conservation efforts aimed at preserving endangered habitat and
species.
Location, Lodging and Food
The facility is located in North Cascades National Park in the heart of the North Cascades mountain
range. Travel time to the Learning Center from Bellingham is approximately two hours. The 16 building
facility includes classrooms, labs, library, dining hall and lodges. Each room sleeps two to three

participants with two shared bathrooms in each lodge. Students are segregated by gender, either in
separate dorms or in the same dorm with the partition closed and locked with a bathroom for each side of
the partition.
Instructors and Chaperones
Students break up into small hiking and learning groups with approximately a one to five adult/student
ratio. Teachers and chaperones are an integral part of Mountain School, participating fully in all activities.
All instructors have CPR and first aid certification. In addition, many instructors have Wilderness First
Responder (WFR) training, an advanced 80-hour first aid certification. Parents will also serve as
chaperones, participating in the learning activities as well as supervising the dorms along with the
teachers. They will be fingerprinted as per District Guidelines.
Costs and Fundraising Plan
The tuition is $137 per student plus the cost of transportation. The total cost to students will not exceed
$160. If they are unable to cover the entire cost, we are asking that they contribute whatever they can
and the remainder will be covered through scholarships or fundraising. We are also asking families to
contribute additional funds for scholarships if they are able and willing to do so. We are also pursuing
other fundraising options should the need arise. Fundraising will be optional and non-graded. Any funds
raised that exceed the cost of transportation will be evenly distributed to the students that are unable to
pay the full tuition.
Transportation
On Wednesday, June 9th, the students of the Greater Yellowstone team will depart from Fairhaven
Middle school at 8:00 AM and travel to the North Cascades Institutes Mountain School. Students will
return to Fairhaven on Wednesday, June 11th at 4:00pm. The fundraising plan describes how we plan on
raising money to pay for our transportation (see Costs and Fundraising).
Communication With Families
This will be the third year that Fairhaven 8th graders will be attending Mountain School. Miguel Boriss,
Joel Gillman, and Kate Larocque, the eighth grade teachers, will be communicating regularly with parents
and providing all the necessary information. Parents will be required to provide written permission using
form 2320F-5.

Consent

TO: Doug Kyles, Executive Director School Administration
FROM: Jane Tromburg, Principal, Parkview Elementary
DATE: February 8, 2010
RE: 5th Grade Class Field Trip to NCI Mountain School
I am writing to request approval for approximately 49 fifth graders to attend the North Cascade Institutes
Mountain School Ecosystem Explorations in the Spring of this school year. Pre-planning for this threeday, two-night field trip, during the week of April 14-16 has included criteria set forth in District Policy and
Procedures (2320) on student trips.
Mountain School Program Summary
The Mountain School program is designed to connect students to the diverse ecosystems and
communities of the national park through outdoor hands-on, experiential-based education. The multidisciplinary Mountain School curriculum is aligned to Washington States Essential Academic Learning
Requirements (EALRs), Grade Level Expectations (GLEs), and the Washington Assessment of Student
Learning (WASL) to facilitate the transfer of information learned at Mountain School back to the
classroom and to each students daily life. In addition to academic lessons learned at Mountain School,
students develop important social skills and a sense of respect for one another and their surrounding
environment as they live and work together in a cooperative community.
The new 5th grade Ecosystem Explorations program gives students the opportunity to hike the Learning
Center trails, investigate the biodiversity of North Cascades plant communities through a hands-on
science investigation, learn about migratory birds that stop over in the North Cascades during their
travels, and examine the tiny, intricate and often overlooked features of the forest community both in the
field and under a microscope back in the lab.
What and Where is Mountain School?
This award-winning program is operated by the North Cascades Institute at their new Learning Center.
The 16 building facility includes classrooms, labs, library, dining hall and lodges. Mountain School
participants stay in three dormitory-style lodges, which sleep a total of 56 participants. Each room sleeps
two to three participants with two shared bathrooms in each lodge. Travel time to the Learning Center
from Bellingham is approximately two hours.
Instructors and Chaperones
Instructors are a combination of graduate students and college interns studying environmental education,
natural science and resource management. National park interpreters supplement the instructional staff.
All instructors have CPR and first aid certification. In addition, many instructors have Wilderness First
Responder (WFR) training, an advanced 80-hour first aid certification. Five parents will also serve as
chaperones, participating in the learning activities as well as supervising the dorms along with the
teachers. They will be fingerprinted as per District Guidelines.

Costs
The full cost of the program is $300 per participant. With scholarships and grant funds North Cascades
Institute provides a sliding scale for schools based on their poverty index. The cost for our students is
$125 per participant. The Parkview PTA will provide scholarships to families for which this is a hardship.
No child will be excluded due to the costs associated with this learning experience. The classroom
teachers attend at no charge.
Communication With Families
This will be the fourth year Parkview fifth graders will be attending Mountain School. Tracy Bell and
Jackie Brown, the fifth grade teachers, will be communicating regularly with parents and providing all the
necessary information. They are excited about this opportunity for their students. Parents will be required
to provide written permission using form 2320F-5.

RE: FBLA State Conference
The Squalicum chapter of Future Business Leaders, (FBLA) would like to attend the State FBLA

conference in Yakima, WA, April 8-10, 2010. The students will leave the morning of the 8th and return the
10th, missing no school as the event is during Spring Break.
Because students must first place in 1st through 5th place at the Regional conference, being held in
Stanwood, February 11, 2010, the exact number of students who will attend State has not been
determined. However, traditionally there have been approximately 20 to 30 students over the past 5+
years. Based on an estimate of 25 students, the cost per student will be $300, covering hotel,
transportation by bus, and registration. Students will pay $75 and the remaining costs will be covered
from previously raised funds from the Squalicum Student Store, Kids Night Out fundraiser and
Entertainment book sales. No student will be denied participation in this activity based on financial need.
This is a competitive conference where students compete in written tests and performance events with
the goal of winning 1st through 5th place awards. Students who win at the Regional FBLA conference
plus the chapter officers are eligible to attend state. The conference provides our students with an
opportunity to demonstrate their business knowledge and skills, build chapter friendships, develop
leadership skills and network with students and advisers from across the state.
Our group would be staying at a hotel in Yakima by the convention center, which will be assigned by the
State FBLA office. We will have two or three adult chaperones (depending on the number of students
who attend), with Diane Bates, teacher/advisor and her husband, Mike Bates and Mrs. Colleen Baldwin,
parent and competitive event judge.

To: Doug Kyles, Executive Director, School Administration
From: Mary Anne Stuckart, Sunnyland Elementary Principal
Re: 5th Grade Class Field Trip to NCI Mountain School
Date: February 18, 2010

Sunnyland Elementary is requesting permission from the Bellingham School Board to attend Mountain
School with all of our fifth grade students from March 29, 30 & 31 for Mr. Steeles classroom and March
31, April 1, & 2 for Mrs. Gates classroom. The North Cascade Institutes Mountain School is a nationally
recognized environmental education program, located in North Cascades National Park.
Curriculum
This nationally recognized program and curriculum aligns well with the Washington State Fifth Grade
Level Expectations in science and literacy and is designed to enhance classroom learning. While at
Mountain School, students spend the majority of their time outside, hiking on trails and exploring
mountain ecosystems first-hand through interdisciplinary activities. The curriculum of Mountain School
includes experiential, hands-on activities in science, math, language, music, art, social studies and
conservation.
The North Cascade Institute requires that a teacher and three to six chaperones accompany each class.
The staff at Mountain School provides teachers with pre-trip lessons to help prepare students for
Mountain School and post-trip surveys for students, chaperones, and teachers to assess the experience
and lessons. The Mountain School Teacher packet also includes parent information in English and
Spanish, information for chaperones, the daily schedules and information relating the activities to fifth
grade GLEs.
Mr. Steele, Mrs. Gates and I believe that all Sunnyland students will benefit from the Mountain School
experience. Many students at Sunnyland have few opportunities to participate in outdoor environmental
education and that this experience provides a valuable opportunity for our many ELL students.
Instructors and Chaperones
North Cascades Institute education staff design lessons, provide leadership and train instructors at
Mountain School. All instructors have CPR and first aid certification. In addition, many instructors have
Wilderness First Responder (WFR) training, an advanced 80-hour first aid certification. Parents will serve
as chaperones, participating in the learning activities as well as supervising the dorms along with the
teachers. They will be fingerprinted as per District Guidelines.
Costs
The full cost of the program is $300 per participant. Travel by school bus is estimated to be about $700.
With scholarships and grant funds, the North Cascades Institute provides a sliding scale for schools
based on their poverty index. The cost for Sunnyland students is $140 per participant including bussing.
We know that some of the Sunnyland families will pay the full $140 and many of the families will pay a
smaller amount commensurate with free/reduced lunch prices. Plans include writing persuasive letters to
the Sunnyland Community and local businesses. Students have sold 60 cases of peanuts and held a
fund raiser at the Park Lanes Bowling Alley. A car wash is planned for March. Due to our hard work, we
only have $1300 left to raise. We will continue to fundraise to provide scholarship support so that all
Sunnyland fifth graders will be able to attend Mountain School. No child will be excluded due to the costs
associated with this trip. The classroom teacher attends at no charge. This is Sunnylands first time to
participate in Mountain School and everyone is looking forward to the adventure.
Communication With FamiliesWe sent home a parent information packet and held a parent meeting in
November. We shared the slideshow created by the North Cascades Institute and reviewed the packet.
Pending School Board approval, parents will be asked to give written permission using form 2320F-5. In
the event that students do not attend the North Cascades Institutes Mountain School, a plan is in place to
offer an alternate placement.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Background Information
Over the last ten months, administrators, along with the support of building staff, have finalized Policy and
Procedure 3022, Student Electronic Resources. This is a new policy addressing access by students to
technology in Bellingham Public Schools.
This policy is modeled after similar policies in other districts and model policies provided to member
school districts by the Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA). The proposed
procedure includes form 3022-F: K-12 Student Acceptable Use Policy and Parent Opt-Out Form. This
form is provided for parents to systematically opt out of student access to the district computer network
and resources.
Continued work centering around establishing procedures for social media aspects of technology will
continue.
Recommended Action
The administration is recommending Board approval of Policy 302, Student Electronic Resources. Also
included for your perusal is the Administrative Procedure 3022P.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.
