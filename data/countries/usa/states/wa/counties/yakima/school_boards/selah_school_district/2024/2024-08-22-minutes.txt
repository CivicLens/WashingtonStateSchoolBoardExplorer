  8. Associate Superintendent for District Operations Report
A. Financial Status Update for July, 2024
Chris Scacco gave an update. We are 91% through the school year in July and have received 88% of our expenditures. Our fund balance was $10.6 million at the end of July. Our estimate was $10.2 million for year-end. Things are looking good for our projections. We are still waiting on our 2 buses that are currently being held up by the Washington State Patrol, due to cup holders installed for the driver. The year-end closing deadlines are that the books must be closed and submitted to OSPI by October 31.
  9. Superintendent Report
A. Superintendent Update
Kevin stated that the district had a positive opening day kickoff on Tuesday morning. Chris mentioned that many groups have begun professional development. We've got students coming on Monday and our adults are ready. He also gave an update on next year's board schedule, with what goes on each month during the board meetings and study sessions. We may need to see how it goes as we added annual reports to the study sessions. The community collaborations will be changed into a superintendent Q & A for 4 different sessions throughout the year and have an open forum for people to ask questions and get answers. Podcasts and videos are platforms we're hoping to utilize so items of interest can be presented on and people can listen in when they have a chance. There are also scheduled visits for board members to go to schools in 2-month blocks, which rotate. The last line have the student representatives scheduled for the schools throughout the district.

Jamie asked to get a heads up for presentation interest the month prior to see if it can be a written update.  He doesn’t want to waste a director’s time for a presentation, if there is not many changes.

Joe asked to hold everyone accountable, that each of the board members give an update during board communications regarding their school visits.
  Dan stated that perhaps for podcasts and video, board members could assist.
  10. Board Communications
A. Board of Directors Communication
Jamie wondered how Courtney Peart’s program was going to be handled this year.  Chris stated that the expectation of the new hire will be continuing with the extra hours and experiences that have been offered in the past. 
  Sarah asked about board member ID cards for the new school year. Kevin indicated that the schedule will be sent for the board to have their ID picture.
  Dan wondered about focusing as a board on Long Term Facilities Plan, student voice, and student safety last year.  He asked to see if there were ideas for focus this year, such as cell phone policy, attendance, data? Please mull these themes over and see if there’s something you’d like to add for this year. Derek inquired about getting input about these ideas from parents.  Kevin indicated that climate survey data was captured last year, so we may have information from that.  If we present the survey with suggested areas, that may be a better way to generate thoughts.

Thank you to the students who presented at kickoff. They were great.
