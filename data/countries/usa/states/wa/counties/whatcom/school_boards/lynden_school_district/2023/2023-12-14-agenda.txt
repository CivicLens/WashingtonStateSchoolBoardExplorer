5. Good News
The Final Mile event was held last month and was a huge success! Students from all three elementary schools can participate
in a marathon over the course of the fall season at their own school. They then gather to run their "final mile" together at the
high school where they receive their medal and celebrate with friends and family!
Lynden Academy K-5 students enjoyed their first "Staycation" during an in-house field trip afternoon consisting of fall themed
crafts, games, and snacks. Lynden Academy's campus days are rigorously academic, so these planned events are essential and
valuable for community building.
Lynden Middle School band and choir concerts were well attended and the students gave wonderful performances!
Fisher Elementary has a new addition in their building! Their new aquarium will be housed in the main entrance of the school
and will be part of the 4th grade science curriculum in partnership with the Nooksack Salmon Enhancement Association. The
whole school will be able to observe the work of the 4th graders each year with salmon eggs arriving in February and a release
in March.
Lynden Academy and the elementary schools all completed parent/teacher conferences in November making great
connections with their families.
The highly capable coordinators at Lynden Middle School have started a monthly program newsletter filled with resources and
classroom highlights for their families.
Lynden Middle School's band had a great time performing at the Lynden Senior Center! The audience was so appreciative and

supportive of the students as they played!
