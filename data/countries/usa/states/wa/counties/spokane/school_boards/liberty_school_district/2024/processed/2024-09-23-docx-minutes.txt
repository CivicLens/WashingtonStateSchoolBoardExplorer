CALL TO ORDER: Board Chair Jeremy Engle called the meeting of the Liberty School District Board of Directors to
order at 7:00 p.m. The flag salute was given, and a quorum was declared. Others present were board members
Mark Bullock, Stephanie Stout, Chad Denny, and Superintendent Jerrad Jeske.
AGENDA REVIEW: No changes to the agenda were made.

SALUTE TO LIBERTY:
• Alex Saywers gave thanks to all of the parent volunteers who put on the Sport-A-Thon
• Jerrad Jeske recognized the food service department for their extra work they have put in this year to
accommodate all of the extra meals the district is now serving.

SUPERINTENDENT REPORT: The following was a part of Jerrad Jeske’s report:
• Enrollment numbers are looking solid. We budgeted for 560 students, and as of today, we’re at 569.98. Last
September, we had 569.17, so we’re nearly identical to last year. While our high school is down by about six
students, our K-8 enrollment is up by roughly seven. These numbers don't include the 20 new TK students,
which we’ve kept separate. Overall, we’re in great shape!
• Danita Shaw in the food services department, continues to collect free & reduced applications from
families. Early #’s indicate that we are projected to qualify next year as well which would give us an
additional 2 years for the free meal program. After qualifying for a total of 4 years, we would then have the
ability to apply for an additional 4-year extension.
Food Service counts:
• Elementary Breakfast- Serving about 200/day which is up 40-60 students
• Elementary Lunch -Serving about 320-340/day which is up about 100 students
• HS breakfast-Serving about 40-60/day but that includes 5th graders
• High school Lunch-Serving about 70-80/day
• Maintenance updates:
• Marshall has a short list of items we want to get done before winter hits. Plan is to add some additional
tar on this flat roof here at the EJH. Also, get all of our parking blocks set before Steve starts plowing
snow.
• Campus Security: With the latest updates we are right around 100 cameras on campus.
• Hidden Rivers gave a quote for the irrigation system along the baseball field. The quote came back at a
little over $20K. We are going to continue to look at some different options.
• Mark Bullock discussed connecting with some people, to see about more bids for the irrigation work.
• Transportation updates:
• Chris Davis continues to work on his bus certification.
• Mark Erickson did put in for the mechanic job. He will have a 20-day grace period based on the PSE
contract.

ELEMENTARY/JUNIOR HIGH REPORT: The following were a part of Alex Saywers report:
• September has been a busy month, working very hard on routines and expectations.
• On September 4th and 5th, teacher covered bus safety rules with all the students. The drivers appreciate
having all of us on the same page and hearing all of the same rules.
• On Friday, September 6th we had our first Kick-off Assembly for the Sport-a-thon. Erica Demateis and Holly
Pratt kicked off our K-8 Sport-a-thon with an Olympic Themed assembly. We had our activity day on
Friday and student enjoyed playing lots of exciting games!
• We have wrapped up our AIMSWeb Assessments and we will have our first Profile Meetings this week to

During our late starts we focused on working on our School Improvement Plan, where staff came up with
the idea of recognizing classrooms for exceptional behavior in some of our common areas. We will focus on
Hallways, Restrooms, and Recess over the next few weeks. Ms. Bair and Mrs. Canning are making some
giant smile tickets we will place on the bulletin board outside the library to recognize our exemplary
classrooms.
Next Monday, we will have our first K-5 Awards Assembly, focusing on the character trait of Dependability.
Next Wednesday, our 8th graders will be attending a field trip to the Unlock Your Future Trades event,
where we will head to the Hub and learn about lots of different career opportunities.
On Friday, October 4th, we will have our first ASB Activity. During periods 5, 6, and 7 students will be able
to rotate to different activity areas hosted by our junior high staff. I look forward to seeing how that goes
after some careful planning from our ASB representatives.
Also, on October 4th we will have our Fall Family Maple Bar Morning at 7:30.
