## 2010-10-14 - BELLINGHAM_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS (Minutes)

The Bellingham School Board meeting minutes detail discussions and actions related to diversity and inclusion initiatives as well as policy changes. A community member advocated for recruiting international students to increase diversity and revenue within the district.  The board unanimously approved several resolutions, including Resolution 22–10 accepting the Shuksan Middle School Reconstruction and Resolution 21–10 regarding Policy Governance. Notably, the board reviewed and approved revisions to Governance Policy GP-3 (Board Job Description) and GP-12 (Cost of Governance). They also heard a first reading of Governance Policy 7.1 (Annual Calendar) and Ends 2.1 (District Standards for Measuring Academic Competence), with the latter being postponed for further discussion due to suggested modifications by Director Steve Smith.
