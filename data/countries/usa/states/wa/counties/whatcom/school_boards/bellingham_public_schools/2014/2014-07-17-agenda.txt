Explanation of Issue: Teaching Channel Agreement
The agreement with the Teaching Channel is a pilot effort to support the use of the Teaching Channel
"Teams" platform among small groups of teacher leaders and principals in the Bellingham School District.
This initial 100 seat contract will enable the creation of up to 10 online teams focused on uploading video
of practice for purpose of fostering collaborative discussion and feedback on teaching and administrative
work. We envision opening up these initial seats to specific groups of teacher leaders, e.g., National
Board candidates, English Language Learner (ELL) specialists, Department of Teaching and Learning
Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs), etc., as well as volunteer principals who are interested in
testing out the platform as a means to foster greater collaboration and communication about practice.
The contract also includes two days of on-site support from representatives from the Teaching Channel.
We will assess our initial use/interest this year before committing additional funds for this effort in any
subsequent year.
