The School Board meeting minutes detail the presentation and discussion of three monitoring reports: EL-5 (Staff Compensation), EL-14 (Academic Program), and EL-15 (Instructional Materials Selection).

They also sought assurance that materials are adapted to diverse student needs. These requests reflect a focus on improving academic standards and curriculum transparency.  

The minutes also indicate that the Board will respond to these monitoring reports at a subsequent meeting (June 9, 2011).

The School Board meeting minutes highlight a focus on community engagement and improving early childhood education.  The board discussed the importance of preschool and leveraging community resources to support families. They also considered establishing links with community agencies to bolster early learning initiatives within schools, including the potential for a "Parent Academy." 

Furthermore, the minutes detail policy changes related to the Board/Superintendent Relationship (B/SR). While most B/SR policies were approved without modifications, B/SR-5, concerning Monitoring Superintendent Performance, underwent a change. The revised policy clarifies the standard for compliance, stating that the Superintendent's interpretation of board policy must be "reasonable."  The board retains final decision-making authority on the reasonableness of interpretations and will provide feedback to the Superintendent through monitoring response documents.

This transcript details feedback from a parent advisory committee meeting regarding various school district policies and practices.  Parents expressed concerns about the inconsistency of science curriculum across schools, advocating for a more standardized approach. They also voiced opinions on the kindergarten schedule, preferring a return to daily half-day sessions with a noon release time. The late start time was another point of contention, leading to supervision issues after school and prompting the PTA to offer before-school activities.  The parent highlighted the positive impact of specialized teachers for PE and music but lamented the cuts to the PE program and the loss of the strings program. Concerns were also raised about the adequacy of special education support for struggling students. The district acknowledged these concerns, particularly regarding the balance between allowing school autonomy and ensuring consistent academic standards across all schools.  The superintendent noted that limited resources necessitate difficult choices, prompting a discussion on prioritizing full-day kindergarten versus other programs.
