Re: Updated Demographic Trends and Enrollment Forecast
_________________________________________________

Enrollment trends and data contribute to staffing, budget, and program decisions each year. The last demographic study was
prepared for the Bainbridge Island School District in October 2021. It has become a standard practice for the district to work with
a consultant to review and update demographic information periodically. Recently, the District again contracted with Education
Data Solutions, LLC.

The presentation will highlight major findings and conclusions, enrollment trends, birth trends, population trends, housing trends,
private and homeschool trends, and a forecast.
