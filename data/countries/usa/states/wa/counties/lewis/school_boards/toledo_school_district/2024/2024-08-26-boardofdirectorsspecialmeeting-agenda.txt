legal counsel available, information regarding the infrastructure and security of computer and telecommunications

identify specific system vulnerabilities, and other information that, if made public, may increase risk to the confidentiality,
integrity, or availability of agency security or to information technology infrastructure or assets;
2. To consider the selection of a site or the acquisition of real estate by lease or purchase when public knowledge regarding
such consideration would cause a likelihood of increased price;
3. To consider the minimum price at which real estate will be offered for sale or lease when public knowledge regarding
such consideration would cause a likelihood of decreased price. However, discussion of the factors comprising the
minimum value of the property, and the final action of selling or leasing public property will be taken in a meeting open to
the public;
4. To review negotiations on the performance of publicly-bid contracts when public knowledge regarding such consideration
would cause a likelihood of increased costs;

such director or staff member, a public hearing or a meeting open to the public will be conducted on such complaint or
charge;
6. To evaluate the qualifications of an applicant for public employment or to review the performance of a staff member;
however, discussion of salaries, wages, and other conditions of employment to be generally applied within the district will

occur in a meeting open to the public, and when the board elects to take the final action of hiring, setting the salary of an
individual staff member or class of staff members, or discharging or disciplining an employee, that action will be taken in
a meeting open to the public;
7. To evaluate the qualifications of a candidate for appointment to the board; however, any interview of such candidate and
final action appointing a candidate to the board will be in a meeting open to the public; or

potential litigation to which the district, the board, or a member acting in an official capacity is, or is likely to become, a
party, when public knowledge regarding the discussion is likely to result in an adverse legal or financial consequence to
the district.
Potential litigation means matters protected by attorney-client privilege related to litigation that has been specifically
threatened; litigation that the district reasonably believes may be commenced; or the litigation or legal risks of a proposed
action or current practice of the district, if public discussion is likely to result in an adverse or financial consequence to the
district.

1. Consideration of a quasi-judicial matter between named parties, as distinguished from a matter having a general effect
on the public or a class or group; or
2. Collective bargaining sessions with employee organizations or professional negotiations with an employee, including
contract negotiations, grievance meetings, and discussions relating to the interpretation or application of a labor
agreement, or that portion of a meeting in which the board is planning or adopting the strategy or position to be taken
