     Todd Nunamaker, Dougal Thomas, Joan Lotze, Charles E Gibson
  Robert Schweitzer, Redistricting Project Manager for Sammamish Data Systems, was also in attendance.

President Gibson shared a description of the meeting's purpose and timeline for continued discussion of Blaine School District's redistricting plan options.
  2. Draft Redistricting Plan
A. Discussion of Redistricting Plan
The board previously met on November 22, 2021 and heard comments from Birch Bay patrons in opposition to the draft redistricting plan published on November 15, 2021. Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger expressed appreciation for the concerned patrons who allowed this process to play out, providing the district with clarification of their desires and with time to consider their input.

President Gibson called for questions from the board and discussion followed. Director Thomas liked the cleaner appearance of the alternate redistricting plan that was provided by Sammamish Data Systems. Mr. Schweitzer described the development of this alternate plan using Census Blocks, building up from the southern part of the district. He likes the alternate plan, although it does displace the current director in District 4. This plan provides two very compact districts located solely within the Birch Bay area. Director Thomas expressed concern about the historical lack of candidates from Birch Bay and discussion followed. It was clarified that Charles Gibson, the displaced director from District 4, would be allowed to finish his current term. Director Lotze agreed that the alternate plan's boundaries made more sense to her by grouping together communities with mutual interest. Director Nunamaker arrived in the meeting at 5:11 p.m. He also shared positive comments on the alternate plan.

Dr. Granger described his meeting last week with Birch Bay community members, as well as the work with Mr. Schweitzer in developing an alternate plan to address their concerns. He thanked Mr. Schweitzer for his tremendous efforts in accommodating the needs of the district.

President Gibson then called for comments from the public.
  Doralee Booth thanked Dr. Granger for taking the time to speak with Birch Bay patrons, for hearing their concerns, and for acknowledging their insights. She also thanked the board for taking time to review the alternate plan. She further described the alternate plan as cohesive by not splitting up neighborhood areas, and she stated that the new plan provides Birch Bay with its desired representation. Ms. Booth commented that Birch Bay residents would be running against themselves in Districts 3 and 4, and she assured the board that efforts would be made to make sure there are Birch Bay candidates to serve in those director positions. Although District 5 includes residents from both Birch Bay and from Blaine, she appreciates that they share an understanding about living south of the railroad tracks.

Pat Jerns expressed appreciation that issues and concerns from Birch Bay were addressed. He feels that the alternate plan addresses those concerns, and he believes it provides a beginning for good balance between Birch Bay and Blaine. He agreed with the comments made by the directors earlier in the meeting.

Dave Wilbrecht shared his appreciation for the thoughtfulness that went into the district's redistricting process, and he also agreed with comments made earlier in the meeting. He thanked the board and Dr. Granger for taking time out of their busy schedules to hear concerns from the Birch Bay community.

Dr. Granger reminded the board that this item will be on the December 14 meeting agenda. Any member of the public who wishes to provide written comments prior to that meeting can do so before noon on December 13.
  Director Nunamaker asked for information about the number of students in each director district. Dr. Granger indicated that he did not have that data available in the meeting but had reviewed it previously. He also reiterated that the redistricting process considers overall population and does not consider population specific to students.

Director Thomas expressed a desire to publicly thank Dr. Granger for his consistent accessibility and willingness to meet and listen to people's concerns. He agreed with the importance of ensuring that the district complies with the law. He commended Dr. Granger for his work in making sure that the district operates within the law while considering the concerns of patrons. Directors Lotze and Nunamaker voiced their agreement, and Doralee Booth described Dr. Granger as Birch Bay's hero for finding a way to address this long-standing concern from their community.
  Discussion continued regarding anticipated future residential development. Mr. Schweitzer encouraged the inclusion of new "through roads" with any new housing development, which would help to create more user-friendly Census Blocks when this process begins again in 2030.
