Approval of the Agenda
Director Gray made a motion to approve the agenda, as presented. Director Burchard seconded
the motion. The motion carried unanimously.
II.
2024-2025 Budget Discussion
Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson first recapped overview budget information shared at
the March 25, 2024 Work Session. To aid the board in their ongoing budget discussion Ms.
Ellingson, at this Work Session, shared more in-depth information on how budget allocations are
determined. The presentation included the following:
•

Fund Balance Information (2023/24 & 2024/25) – For the 2023/24 school year the
forecasted amount needed from Fund Balance will be approximately $4 million. This is
less than originally projected. Preliminary estimates for 2024/25 predict needing to
access approximately $1.8 million from Fund Balance. Included in this amount are
monies ($574,000) that Nutrition Services anticipates accessing from restricted funds
that can only be spent on expenses related to Nutrition Services. The assumptions used
in making these ending fund balance projections, and the items/areas still pending that
could impact these projections, were also shared. Included on the pending list were both
Nutrition Services and Special Education. For 2024/25 it was noted the first collection
date for new levy monies is April 2025.
In response to board questions, Ms. Ellingson provided an overview of the Nutrition
Services budget and shared that, while Special Education will need enhanced staffing in
2024/25 as compared to 2023/24, she is working with the department to determine
exactly how much. Updated budget information on both of these departments will be
shared with the board at an upcoming Work Session.
The topic of elementary school supplies, including the original rationale for providing
basic school supplies for elementary students and whether or not the district should
continue the practice, was discussed. It was the consensus of the board to make no
change in practice regarding elementary school supplies for the upcoming school year.

•

Cash Flow Projections – A graph illustrating monthly cash flow fluctuations and ending
cash flow balances for 2020/21, 2021/22 and 2022/23, as well as projections for
2023/24 (approximately $8 million) and 2024/25 (slightly over $6 million) was shared.

•

FTE Enrollment Report – Board members were provided with a chart showing
anticipated enrollment at each school/grade level and the budgeted certificated staff
(MEA) FTE allocated to the school based on this enrollment for both basic education,
special education and special programs (Title, LAP, Transitional K, SOAR, Dual Language,
ELD and Highly Capable). Regarding special education, Ms. Ellingson reminded the
staffing allocation is under review and will most likely decrease.

The chart additionally includes budgeted allocations for certificated administrators and
classified staff by building and/or department. Regarding para educators the chart
provides specific detail on the hours/day allocated to each school/program.
•

Prototypical Funding vs Actual Staffing – Two charts were provided comparing
positions/monies received from the state via the prototypical school funding model and
the actual staff, with associated costs, needed to provide the educational experience
provided by the Mead School District. The first chart included overview information with
the second being more in-depth in nature. Local levy funds pay for 67.15 certificated
non-administrator positions (15%), 9.63 certificated administrator positions (29%) and
82.4 classified support staff positions (38%).

•

MEA Staffing Distribution – A chart showing, as a percentage, the number of certificated
staff members at each step on the salary schedule was shared. 37% are at the highest
step on the salary schedule (MA/90, Step 16). 82% of teachers have a Master’s Degree.
The district currently employs 759 teachers - 130 have 0-4 years of experience, 122 have
5-9 years of experience, 143 have 10-14 years of experience, 149 have 15-19 years of
experience, 100 have 20-24 years of experience, 67 have 25-29 years of experience and
48 have 30+ years of experience.

•

Staffing Distribution by Group – A pie chart, based on 2024/25 preliminary budget
numbers and showing salary percentages by group, was shared. As expected, certificated
non-administrative staff (primarily teachers) represents the largest percentage (66%).
Salaries and benefits represent 82% of the district’s overall budget.

Noting nurse staff was reduced in the current school year, Director Gray asked for an update to
ascertain if there is a need to add staff back. Superintendent Hanson noted there have been a
number of “asks” from various departments/schools for increased staffing. A list of asks will be
prepared and shared with the board. Director Burchard noted the importance of considering
requests from a risk-based standpoint.
As requested at the March 25th Work Session, Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson shared a
list of potential reductions. She noted the importance of only adding something to the budget if
something of similar cost is removed.
Board discussion on the 2024/25 budget will once again be an agenda item at the May 20th Work
Session.
VIII. Adjourn
The meeting was adjourned at 7:20 pm.
