2.5 Resolution 33-23, Certification of 2024 Excess
Property Taxes

Meeting :

Nov 9, 2023 - Regular Board Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached resolution in connection with
excess property taxes. As superintendent, I have
reviewed and approve this item.

Public Content
Staff Contact:Kathryn Weilage, Chief Financial Officer

Explanation of Issue:
Resolution 33-23 certifies the districts levy collections for calendar year 2024 to Whatcom County. This adjusts the local levy to the levy
authority as providedby voters. Under law, the board of directors is required to certify the levy amount to the assessor by November 30.

At the February 11, 2020 election, the voters of Bellingham passed a General Fund Educational Support and Operations Excess Levy in the
amount of $35,000,000 for collection in calendar year 2024. Recent changes in the laws regarding imposition of local tax levies and use of
local revenues have limited the amount of money that may be collected by school districts in the form of local levies for general operational
purposes.

During the budget process, we estimated the levy collection for 2024 at $35,000,000. Using the state's formula, the district is eligible to
receive $2,500 per pupil, adjusted for inflation annually since 2020. The district is allowed to certify up to the amount authorized by voters,
which may be adjusted to the amount calculated under state law by the county before collection. Accordingly, we are requesting that the
board certify the $35,000,000 approved by voters. The debt service and capital projects levy certifications reflect voter authorizations plus
adjustment for refund amounts that are collectible by the district by law; these amounts are advised by Whatcom County.
