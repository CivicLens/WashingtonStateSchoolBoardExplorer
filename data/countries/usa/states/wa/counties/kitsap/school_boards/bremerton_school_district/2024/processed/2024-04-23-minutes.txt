  2. STRATEGIC PLAN REVIEW
Rose Wagner presented the Strategic Plan Survey Results:
160 employees completed survey
Bremerton High School and Renaissance High School Staff still needs to complete the survey
There was confusion around the purpose of the Promise Statement and there were wonderings if we could live out promise
Core values-there was strong alignment from survey that they should be the core values
Portrait of a Graduate- survey showed all above 90% agreement
Goals and measures- All high ratings
Some of measures will be flushed out more
Signature Strategies- All high 80s and low 90s for agreement
Promise Statement was revised to removed repetition- Our Unconditional Promise: Empowering your voice, your dream, your future. We are Bremerton!
President Rotter commented that she likes slimed down version and that it captures the sentiment. The board really wanted student voice to lead this and that is where this came from- their wishes/what they want from us.
Goals and Measure-
District leadership is making small tweaks to measures to be more specific
Signature Strategies:
Director Rotter wants to ensure that the language used is understandable to the ley person and to take out things that no one but internal people know what it means (instead of saying CEL 5 D just say Teacher evaluation rubric).
The final draft review will be on May 28th.
