Treatment and rehabilitation. The team qualified for National and

Kudos to the students at Lynden Middle School who emptied their pockets, piggy banks, turned in their
birthday money, looked under sofa cushions, cleaned their rooms and turned in over $1,500 for our
Leukemia & Lymphoma Society "Pennies for Patients" fundraiser! They set a goal of $1,200 with a stretch
goal of $1,500, and the students exceeded the stretch goal. They demonstrated their care and
compassion of others!
Lynden Middle School successfully completed their Strengthening Families Program dual-language in
Spanish and English. Twelve families, 8 Spanish and 5 English, participated along with an amazing support
staff. We are the only school district in Whatcom County and the Northwest who have (1) two programs
running in conjunction with each other dual-language and (2) two full sets of trained facilitators (4 in each
program) that are District Employees.
Isom Elementary has been identified as a 2016 Washington Achievement Award Winner! The award is
specifically in the area of "Closing the Achievement Gap for Students with Disabilities".
Fisher Elementary and a local church partnered to start a program to send a backpack filled with food
home with some of their students whose families are in need. There is enough funds to carry this through
the end of the year with the hope that we are able to find additional organizations and partners to help
support and fund this next year.
The School District was honored to award Lynden Door with the WASA Community Leadership Award for
their commitment to opening the Technic Training Center at Lynden Door for community students.
May 8th - 12th is Teacher Appreciation Week. Governor Jay Inslee has issued a proclamation. Don't
