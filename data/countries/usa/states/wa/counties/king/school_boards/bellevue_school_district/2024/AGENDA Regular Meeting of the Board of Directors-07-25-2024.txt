Information

Public Content
The Board is grateful to receive public comment and appreciates the thoughtful input of its community.
Because of the limitations of the Boards calendar, Public Comment is generally limited to 20 minutes per
meeting. If you would like to address the Board on an issue, please limit your remarks to not more than 2
minutes. To maximize the number of comments we can hear, please use only the time you need to make
your statement. You may provide written documentation to the Board Secretary to be included as part of
the official record. The Board will listen to all comments carefully but will generally not respond to
comments spontaneously or without further deliberation.
The meeting chair may terminate an individual's statement when the allotted time has passed. Although
this can be disappointing, please consider that this is to enable the maximum number of comments to be
heard and that there are numerous additional ways to share feedback with the Board and the district.
The meeting chair may also interrupt a speaker to require the same standard of civility that the Board
imposes on itself. Examples of uncivil comments include comments that:

Are libelous or slanderous;
Are an unwarranted invasion of privacy;
Are obscene or indecent pursuant to the Federal Communications Act or any rule or regulation of the
Federal Communications Commission;
Violate school district policy or procedure related to harassment, intimidation, bullying, or discrimination;
Incite an unlawful act on school premises or violate a lawful school regulation; or
Create a material and substantial disruption of the orderly operation of the Board meeting.
The Board as a whole has the final decision in determining the appropriateness of all such rulings and
can maintain order by removing those who are disruptive. The Board recognizes, however, the distinction
between uncivil discourse, which it will not tolerate, and comments about the Board, district, and/or staff
that are negative yet still civil in nature and will exercise its authority to maintain order in a content-neutral
manner.
The Board has a dedicated email address (Board@bsd405.org) and voicemail (425-456-4270) for
receiving communication in the senders' language of choice that is distributed/transcribed to all Board
directors and logged with staff.
