## 2024-02-20 - LYNDEN_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Lynden School District Board of Directors met on February 20, 2024, to discuss several key issues.  A primary focus was the potential placement of a General Obligations Bond on the April ballot for funding capital improvements. While some community members advocated for the bond's inclusion, citing the need for updated facilities and their positive impact on student learning, the board ultimately voted against moving forward with an April election due to concerns about insufficient time for community engagement and due diligence.  The board also discussed Resolution #02-24, which expressed opposition to House Bill 2331 and Senate Bill 5462. The specific content of these bills was not detailed in the minutes.
