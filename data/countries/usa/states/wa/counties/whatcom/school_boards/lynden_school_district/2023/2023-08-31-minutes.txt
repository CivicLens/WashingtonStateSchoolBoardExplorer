4. Information from the Audience
5. Reports
a. SuperintendentSchool Finance and Local Funding InitiativesTrevor Carlson with Piper Sandler was in attendance to present a tax rate analysis to the
board regarding a potential bond. Discussion was held on understanding bond and levy
impacts on the community. The presentation included historical information, the
mechanics of elections and election results, as well as historical passage rates for levies
and bonds. He presented the 2022 and 2023 Washington School Bond Election Results.
He also shared historical election results specific to Lynden. He covered the impact of
McCleary in 2019 which capped the tax amount increases. Mr. Carlson shared
comparable tax rates with other districts in Whatcom County. He then gave an overview
of bonds and capital project levies which included what each can be used for, the
difference between the two, and the voting requirements for passing each of them.
His presentation continued with information on interest rates, tax-exempt yield curves,
and assessed value. He concluded his presentation by sharing projected tax rate impacts
based on different bond amounts.
b. Teaching and Learning
c. Finance and Operations
6. Board Workshop
Superintendent VanderYacht gave a brief introduction regarding capital facilities work. This
included a brief description of the work that has been done by three separate community facility
planning groups- a facility planning committee, a long range facilities planning committee, and a
bond planning task force. He shared the goals, mission, and results of each group that have
previously been submitted to the board.
The discussion tonight focused on the bond planning task force. A recommendation of a bond
resolution was presented to the board on August 10th. Superintendent VanderYacht briefly
summarized the key findings of the bond planning task force.
Director Costanti facilitated a board discussion focused on scope (needs of district), timing
(campaign, election, design, construction), and costs (value proposition for our students,
families, and the community) of a bond resolution. The board discussed the scope of work vs.
cost. A question was asked about whether we should consider not including the elementary

schools in this bond, thereby asking the community to approve a lower cost. The BPTF felt very
strongly that our increasing enrollment patterns at the elementary schools needs to be
addressed immediately and included in this bond. We currently have 25 portables in the district,
and 18 of those are at two elementary schools.
Director Vis made several comments on the scope of work and whether we could cut some items
off of the list. He suggested considering paying for some of those projects with the district’s
operating budget instead so we can use that money toward a bigger high school with more
square footage.
One member of the group clarified that decommissioning Judson Hall and converting the old gym
at Fisher to a district warehouse were not in their original scope of work.
Further discussion was held about what our community tax payers would be willing to pay.
The Board had lengthy discussion on education and providing information to the community that
is clear and transparent.
Ashley McClaran was also in attendance and shared information on construction management
models.
The board then discussed timing- most agreed that late September or early October would be
ideal for approval of a bond resolution. The time needed to form a Citizens Group to promote the
bond and have time to get information out to the community is essential. September 28th is a
possibility for resolution if the plan is to move forward with putting a bond on the February 2024
ballot.
General consensus was that there is no interest in delaying the timing or significantly adjusting
the recommendation of the Bond Planning Task Force.
7. Public Comment
The public was invited to provide comments and feedback regarding the capital facilities
discussion that they observed during the board workshop.
A community member discussed the importance of asking for the full amount so that we can
accomplish what needs to be done. That will need to include reaching out to community
members that have students in Lynden Christian.
A community member and BPTF member clarified that the building conditions are not going
away or getting better. The board will need to work fast. These needs are immediate. Outreach
to the community should include PTA meetings, senior center, and attendance of community
meetings such as Kiwanis and Lions Club.
A community member expressed appreciation to the bond planning task force for their work and
the level of detail they included in their report. He also appreciated the board asking questions
that were fiscally responsible. He expressed the importance of coming up with a plan and the

creation of a committee to help pass this bond. He also expressed the importance of a backup
plan if it fails.
Superintendent VanderYacht shared that there are community members who have reached out
with interest in leading the citizens group. Clarification was given by Ashley McClaran regarding
communication about the bond to the community before the resolution has been adopted by the
board and confirmed this is allowed within certain parameters.
A community member shared information on the economy and RCW’s and WAC’s regarding
state-funded schools. She also shared ideas on how the district may be able to save money in
their operating budget.
A community member acknowledged the support of our community for education. He also
wanted to make the board aware of the plans of local private schools that will be happening
simultaneously with the district’s bond resolution.
8. Information from Board Members
The Board discussed the upcoming WSSDA General Assembly scheduled for September 22-23rd.
Director Hickman will be attending the event virtually.
She shared her goals as the legislative representative for the district. She asked the board
members to read the General Assembly handbook and decide on what measures the board
would like to vote on. She expressed that this is a big opportunity for us to have a voice. Further
discussion regarding General Assembly will be on the agenda for the 9/14 board meeting.
9. Adjourn Meeting to go into Closed Session
CJ Costanti motioned to adjourn the meeting at 9:47pm.
10. Closed Session
An update was provided to the board regarding the collective bargaining negotiations.
