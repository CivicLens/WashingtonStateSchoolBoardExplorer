LWSD School Board Statement
Juneteenth
June 2024
Juneteenth holds significant historical, cultural, and societal importance in the United States. It
commemorates the emancipation of the last Confederate community of enslaved African Americans and
symbolizes the ongoing struggle for freedom, equality, and justice. Juneteenth serves as a reminder of
the unyielding resilience, strength, and ingenuity of the Black community, while also highlighting the need
to continue working towards a society free from racial oppression. Lake Washington School District
celebrates Juneteenth as a formal holiday to honor the ancestors of the past, celebrate the change
agents of the present, while laying the foundation for a more inclusive and equitable future.

6. Surplus Of Equipment, Books And Vehicles,
Resolution No. 2376

Meeting :

Jun 3, 2024 - Board Meeting - 7:00 p.m.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Adopt Resolution No. 2376 declaring the equipment and
materials listed on the attached page as surplus to the
needs of the district and authorizing the superintendent to
proceed with the distribution, transfer, sale, or disposal of
items listed.

Public Content
SITUATION:
In the normal course of district operations, materials and equipment become dated, damaged and in
many cases, unusable or unsupportable. Our last surplus authorization for equipment was in June 2023.
Since that time, we have been accumulating items that are no longer of any use to the schools or
departments.
Also included in this request are vehicles that are being surplused due to the age and increasing cost of
repair, maintenance and operation. The buses are no longer on the state depreciation schedule. Some of
the buses have been used for parts on other buses as needed.
In order to dispose of this equipment and materials, they must be declared surplus to the needs of the
district. Resolution No. 2376 has been prepared in order to do so.
Once this property is declared surplus by the board and appropriate public notifications are made, we will
offer it for sale/redistribution consistent with the requirements of RCW28A.335.180. This could include
sales to other private and public schools, sale to the general public and/or disposal. As appropriate, we
will use the state surplus warehouse for disposal.
RECOMMENDATION:
The Board of Directors adopts Resolution No. 2376 declaring the equipment and materials listed on the
attached page as surplus to the needs of the district and authorizing the superintendent to proceed with
the distribution, transfer, sale, or disposal of items listed.

Situation
Lake Washington School Districts Building Excellence Plan is a multi-phase plan to provide permanent classrooms for students, address
aging facilities and reduce reliance on portables. Phase I of the Building Excellence Plan was approved by voters in February 2022. Phase II
will focus on aging facilities with a goal of rebuilding/enlarging the four remaining schools that have not received upgrades or rebuilds since
the start of the 1998 modernization program.
The board considered recommendations, received information, and feedback in six study sessions between March 2023 and March 2024.
The Facility Advisory Committee provided feedback on recommendations for future facility planning to accommodate our changing
enrollment landscape and continue to provide learning environments that promote excellence for students.

An overview of the Construction Levy recommendation was presented to the board of directors at the regularly scheduled meeting on May
20, 2024.
