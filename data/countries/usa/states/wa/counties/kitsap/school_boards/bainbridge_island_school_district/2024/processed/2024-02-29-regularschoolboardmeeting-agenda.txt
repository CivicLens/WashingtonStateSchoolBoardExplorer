To: Amii Thompson, Superintendent
From: Kiyo Toma, Director of Technology
Re: Network Switch Refresh Project
Type: Action

Summary: BISDs current set of network switches are approaching the end of their lifecycle. In order to
maintain a high-quality network service for K-12 education and operations, Technology Services is
seeking Board approval to move forward on the Network Switch Refresh project.
Background: In December 2023, Technology Services posted a public RFP for vendors to bid on the
BISD Network Switch Refresh project. The key goals for the BISD Network Switch Refresh Project are:
1. Replacing the existing 8 year old network switches across all seven school sites and district offices
(Administration, Technology, Capital Projects, Transportation, etc.)
2.

2. Upgrading to faster switches with support for current and emerging standards such as PoE++, AI
monitoring, cloud-based management
3. Selecting a vendor able to provide high quality support and warranty services
4. Balancing investment costs with long-term care and quality of service
5. Ensuring the project qualifies for the federal e-Rate reimbursement program (estimated 40%
savings of total costs)
We reviewed the vendor responses to the RFP in January 2024 and would like to present a summary of
the project requirements, the vendor responses, and our recommendation to the Board of Directors. If
approved by the Board, the project will be managed by Technology Services staff with support from the
awarded vendor. The project is scheduled to begin in the summer of 2024 and may extend into the 202425 school year.
I recommend the Board of Directors approve the Network Switch Refresh Project for the 2023/24 and
2024/25 school years.
Proposal $ 690,500

Re: Capital Projects, Facilities and Operations Report - February 2024
______________________________________________________________________
Small Works Capital Projects
DA Hogan and Associates are refining multiple design concepts of the Central Campus
Athletic Complex for Capital Committee review during the 2023/2024 school year.
Capital staff are working with the COBI Public Works Department to obtain an updated
industrial waste discharge permit for the connection to the citys sanitary sewer line as a
result of the successful sewer lift station replacement.

The Long-Range Strategic Facilities Planning Committee will resume regular meetings on
March 13th and continue through June of this year. The Sustainable Action Planning
Committee held another successful and enlightening committee meeting on February 14th.
An in-depth discussion and brainstorming activity regarding health, biophilia, and site water
were conducted.
NW Lift and Equipment has submitted the necessary paperwork to start the contract
writing process for the replacement of the heavy-duty vehicle lift system at the
transportation shop facility. A draft contract is being revised in preparation for legal review.
Meetings have been scheduled with the contractor to determine a definitive schedule for
the project.
Permits for the Woodward Middle School Restroom Renovation Project have been
submitted to COBI for review. Capital staff are working with architects and consultants to
prepare bid documents and a competitive request for proposals to local contractors.
In preparation for potential future district-wide projects, Capital staff are working to
research and develop district standards related to solar applications that will allow the
district to experience utility savings in the future. Part of this research will include the
compilation and categorization of various grant opportunities available at both the state
and federal levels.
Transportation
One driver in training has completed her training and obtained a CDL. She began
substituting for regular routes on February 17th.
There is currently one driver in training and the department is preparing to solicit additional
candidates to begin training in the near future.
Operations
Facilities staff were busy performing restorative and preventive maintenance at all school
facilities during the mid-winter break. Including but not limited to, floor care, light fixture
replacement, and detailed cleaning.
Maintenance staff have begun removing fixed locker units at Woodward Middle School in
an effort to widen existing corridors and alleviate congestion during passing times.
Groundskeepers are working to prepare outdoor athletic facilities for spring sports and are
coordinating maintenance schedules for practices and games with the athletic department
for Bainbridge Island High School and Woodward Middle School.

Re: Monthly Report on Technology Levy, Planning and Projects

Technology Levy Budget Summary
This is a summary of the 2023/2024 technology levy budget. This summary provides information on the total encumbrances
(outstanding and paid) applied to the 2023/2024 fiscal school year. The 2023/2024 technology levy budget is supported by
collections from 2021 BISD technology levies.
SY 2023/2024Technology Levy Budget Capacity
Encumbered To Date (Commitment to Pay when Invoiced)
Variance (Est. Remaining Encumbered Budget Capacity)

$ 2,866,770.00
$ 1,333,561.01

Overall, our operational technology status continues to be healthy. Since the last Technology Monthly Report in January 2024,
there have been no major technology financial expenditures outside of monthly payroll.
Over the mid-winter break, BISD Technology Services completed the transition to a modern SIP phone system, which provides a
higher quality of service compared with our legacy system. We are currently working on a budget analysis for the next school
year, with the goal to adjust payroll expenditures in General Funds and the current 2021-2024 Technology Levy for technology
positions.
Lastly, as the Director of Technology for BISD, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Bainbridge Island community
for their continued support of the Technology Levy.
