Commission Chair Pat Wright asked that Commission members review the Tourism Reports on their own.

Action, Motions: 2. Downtown Wayfinding Signage Grant Application
The Commission discussed that this was a great way to say “You were expected” and help give people a
‘sense of place’ wherever they are in town. This also makes town more welcoming and hopefully helps
visitors decide to return. Ryan Clements with the 2040 Wayfinding Committee also attended the meeting

to answer any questions regarding the Wayfinding Application. He expounded that these are for
Wayfinding signs not covered in the Downtown project, these signs will be in wider scope of Pullman.
When asked if other funding sources had been researched. Ryan noted that LTAC was the initial source for
this piece of the Wayfinding signs, however, there is conversation on looking at additional sources. The
Commission did ask if Pullman businesses had been approached as an additional source of funding for
Wayfinding signage. While it currently has not been asked of businesses, Ryan noted the suggestion. The
Commission inquired had Ryan solicited more than one bid for the Wayfinding signage, is this the same
company that was being used for the Downtown Pullman work, is it a local company? This was currently
the only bid and the closest company that had been asked to provide a bid. As this was not a timesensitive issue, the Commission did request a second bid for the Wayfinding signs. The Commission did
find this was a good investment with the signs expected to last at least 20 years.
The Commission unanimously agreed to recommend a grant of up to $9000.00 be extended to the 2040
Wayfinding Committee and City of Pullman with the contingency that a second bid be obtained.

Action, Motions: 3. American Junior Golf Association Grant Application
The Commission reviewed the application. The Commission discussed the past success of this event and
prior applications. The Commission had additional budget questions for American Junior Golf Association
(AJGA) as well as questions regarding sponsorship for the event. The Commission unanimously agreed to
defer a decision on this grant application and requested additional information regarding the following: 1.
The Commission requested a more detailed budget on expenditures that the grant would cover. 2. If the
City of Pullman (through the LTAC grant request) is the primary sponsor—what would the sponsorship
package include? These requests were to be forwarded to Libby Boroughs and the application would be
reviewed at the next LTAC meeting.
