Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the Happy Valley Elementary School
Constructability Report, which is required to receive state
construction assistance funding. A team from Meng Analysis
reviewed the plans and submitted a report witlh their
comments and questions. Based on their report, the design

team revised portions of the drawings and produced a clean
set of plans. As Superintendent, I have reviewed, approved
and am submitting as a consent item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
One of the requirements for receiving state construction assistance funding for Happy Valley Elementary is for the district to
hire an independent consultant to conduct a constructability review of the project documents. The process involves reviewing
the plans associated with the project in order to identify errors, ambiguities, omissions, discrepancies, and conflicts that could
become potential problem areas during the construction phase and result in costly change orders and/or claims.
A team from Meng Analysis spent a week reviewing the Happy Valley plans and produced a 60+ page report containing
comments and questions generated from their review. The report then went to the design team who reviewed the comments
and provided a response to each comment/question. More importantly, the review resulted in the design team revising
portions of the drawings where problem areas were identified, producing a clean set of plans for bidders. Mr. Cowan and Mr.
Lawyer have reviewed the report and responses with the design team. A copy of the report is posted to the Board Docs
Library.
I recommend your approval of the Constructability Review Report.
