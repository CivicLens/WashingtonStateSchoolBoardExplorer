Meeting Purpose – Explanation of Community Linkages: School Board Director Jenn
Mason thanked everyone for taking time to be here this evening. She shared that the
school board and district are very interested in learning how to best support families, and
community linkages are an opportunity to strengthen the school board’s connections with
our students and families. More specifically, the board is seeking input on the goals we
have set for our students through our board policies expressed in The Bellingham
Promise.
Small Group Discussion with School Board Members and Facilitators: For
discussion purposes, attendees divided into four groups, facilitated by Isabel Meaker,

Kristi Dominguez, Steve Clarke and Mike Copland. The small groups focused on the
following guiding questions:
1. How do you see The Bellingham Promise connected to your work in supporting
our families through challenge?
2. What is working well for our students and families?
3. What is missing or needs improvement?
4. What do you see with our families that maybe we’re not seeing?
5. How can we better work together?
At the conclusion of the small group time, Dr. Copland asked each table group to share
briefly what they discussed. Following is a summary of responses to the guiding
questions:

Whatcom Detention Center (WDC), as a school, can be more calming for students
than a traditional school.
The Bellingham Promise demonstrates how we care about children, teaching them
to be their best selves.
Students entering WDC are assessed and typically learn a year’s worth of math
and language arts content in 90 days.
Students need to be recognized, but WDC cannot issue credit or graduate
students.
It is important to continue strengthening the relationship between WDC and
Bellingham Public Schools. Because of the nature of detention, WDC is able to
learn a lot about what is happening in their students’ lives while the students are
under their care.
WDC would like to continue the partnership with Bellingham Public Schools,
including staff training.
A “rapid response team” should be considered (homeless liaison, counselor, etc.).
Executive Director Jay Jordan read a poem written by a WDC student.
A collective buy-in is needed to do all that we can to help students and families.
The increased family engagement team is working to level the playing field for
families.
The elimination of school fees helps to ease families’ minds.
The Bellingham Promise is flexible and does not reflect a cookie-cutter approach.
More staff training is needed to support students with challenging behaviors and
living in difficult circumstances.
There was discussion regarding the loss of academic traction for students over the
summer, with an interest in a longer school year.
Where are we reducing opportunities for students to feel “less than”?
There is power in the relationships between teacher and child, child and parent.
Students who have experienced trauma benefit from firm boundaries.
All school staff, not just teachers, should receive interactive training and coaching
around challenging behaviors and how to be an advocate for kids.
LGBTQ youth typically struggle with a lack of family acceptance.

Curriculum and expectations need to be tailored to students.
The new portions of The Bellingham Promise are important for students to hear
and be reminded of.
The district is committed to facilitate change.
“Teaching” refers to all staff (custodians, food service, paraeducators), not just
certificated staff, so it is important to communicate with and train all staff.
It’s important to have adults use preferred pronouns, etc.
There is some discrepancy in the referral rates to Northwest Youth Services by
school.
More parent engagement is needed for parents of LGBTQ youth.
Whatcom Youth Pride is June 9.

Dr. Copland thanked everyone for being here this evening. The notes from this meeting
will be added to the website and will be a part of our district’s history. He shared that the
learnings from this evening will be referenced in many settings including future school
board meetings and executive meetings.
Ms. Mason also thanked all who attended.
Ms. Diaz Hackler adjourned the meeting at 7:05 p.m.
