Meeting :

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff has submitted the attached resolution relating to the
sale of bonds in connection with our $160 million bond
issue. As Superintendent, I have reviewed and approve this
resolution and am submitting it as a consent agenda item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
The attached resolution authorizes the sale of $60 million of bonds associated with our $160 million bond
issue after the bond election has been certified by the Whatcom County Auditor. In addition, the
resolution authorizes the sale of $34 million of bonds to refund (refinance) certain existing bonds at lower
interest rates if market conditions are favorable for doing so. The actual bond sale is currently scheduled
for December 3, 2013, subject to market conditions.
As we discussed previously, this is a'delegation resolution', whereby you are delegating
temporaryauthority to the Superintendent to approve the final structure and interest rates associated with
the bonds. The advantage of a delegation resolution is that it allows for the district to quickly enter the
bond market when conditions are favorable. Without a delegation resolution, the district's only option is to
enter the bond market on the date of a regular or special board meeting which may or may not be a date
that is most advantageous to the district. You will notice several blanks throughout the document. These
are provisions that will be determined as we get closer to the sale date. A complete summary will be
provided after the bonds are sold.
I recommend approval of attached resolution 19-13.

Meeting :

Nov 14, 2013 - Regular Meeting, 6 p.m.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff has submitted to me the attached resolution in
connection with the establishment of the actual
Maintenance and Operations Levy for 2014. As
Superintendent, I have reviewed and approve this resolution
and am submitting it as a consent agenda item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
As we discussed during the budget process, we knew our voter approved Maintenance and Operations Levy of $29,300,000 for
2014 collection would exceed the maximum allowable levy lid amount. In formulating the budget, we took this into consideration
and did not allocate resources based on the $29,300,000. Rather, we used an estimated levy lid amount of $27,518,262 to
allocate resources.
Now, after all of the information used to determine the levy lid is available, the actual levy lid amount is $27,831,882 compared to
our estimate. The net financial result for 2013-14, assuming the levy is fully collected in the spring of 2014, will be a revenue
increase of approximately $160,000.
The attached Resolution 20-13 will be used to formally establish our actual Maintenance and Operations Levy for 2014 at the
levy lid amount of $27,831,882.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
The 2013 Legislature appropriated $7 million in the 2013-15 capital budget for a new round of energy
efficiency grants. There is also $2 million remaining from previous appropriations. The $9 million in longterm energy efficiency grants of up to $500,000 per district will be awarded in one round in mid-March
2014.
We previously applied for and were awarded a similar grant for making lighting and controls
improvements along with water use improvements at several schools.

One of the required actions in order to apply for this round of grants is to enter into an Interagency
Agreement with the Department of Enterprise Services to provide for project management and monitoring
services including the selection of a pre-qualified Energy Service Company (ESCO), eliminating the need
to formally bid the project work; identifying potential energy savings projects; negotiating ESCO fees;
assistance with design, construction and commissioning services, energy audit services, etc.
