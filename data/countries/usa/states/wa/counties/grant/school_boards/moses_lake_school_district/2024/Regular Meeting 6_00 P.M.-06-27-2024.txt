This will be a 60 minute exempt meeting.
Exempt Meeting:Some meetings frequently held by school boards are not subject to the OPMA. They are known Exempt meetings. The
board need not provide public notice or public access when it is gathering for collective bargaining sessions, grievance meetings and
discussions on the interpretation or application of a collective bargaining agreement.For example, student disciplinary hearings and
collective bargaining sessions with employee groups do not require public notice or access.
Executive Session:Parts of board meetings can be held without the public. These portions of the meeting are called executive sessions. If
the board is going into executive session, the president or chair must announce the general purpose of the session and how long it will last.
If the executive session runs longer, the president or chair must make another announcement extending the session.
