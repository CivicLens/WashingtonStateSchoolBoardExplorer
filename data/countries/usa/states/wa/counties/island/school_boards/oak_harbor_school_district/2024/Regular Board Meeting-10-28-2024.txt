Amber Hagel, Jennifer Bassett, Cat Ian Frese, Nevada Van Natter, and Tricia Hart have worked for over a year revamping how
HCE serves all students' academic and social emotional needs at their level. This involved aligning our master schedule,
creating structured blocks of CORE instruction time and intervention/extension blocks tailored to each individual students' needs.
This team of educators is dedicated to the needs of all students, not just those assigned to their caseloads.

Our amazing para educators are grouped based on content area to support instruction, intervention and the immediate social
emotional needs of students. They have been extremely flexible in the daily changes to their schedules as we refine this work.
The entire team puts the needs of our students first with enthusiasm and are always searching for strategies to make the system
work the best for all students. They are simply AMAZING:)
