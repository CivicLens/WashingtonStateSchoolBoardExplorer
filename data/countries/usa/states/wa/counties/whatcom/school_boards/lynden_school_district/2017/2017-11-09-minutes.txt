children and was attended by 1200 people. Local companies and organizations provided hands on
experiences for children. Eleven of our LHS Honor society students volunteered their time to help
supervise booths and sell snacks and pizza at cost. Feedback on our student volunteers was universally
positive and the exhibitors said our students helped to make their experience very enjoyable in the midst
of so many parents and children.
The blood drive at Lynden High School had 52 donors, including both students and staff. Congratulations
