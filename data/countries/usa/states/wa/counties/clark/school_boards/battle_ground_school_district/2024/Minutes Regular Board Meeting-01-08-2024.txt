Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors approve Resolution A-24 Clark
Regional Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan.

Public Content
Presenter:
Cheri Dailey
Director of Risk Management and Business Operations
Background:
Request the School Board to formally adopt by Resolution the following parts of the Clark Regional Natural Hazard Mitigation
Plan (CRNHMP):
All of Volume 1.
The Introduction, Appendices and Battle Ground School District Jurisdictional Annex of Volume 2.
Formal adoption is required to receive final plan approval from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
In 2016, the County and 16 jurisdictional partners began a project to complete a Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan (NHMP). The
Board formally adopted that plan on April 10, 2017, by Resolution No. C-17.

FEMA requires NHMP to undergo a complete review and update every five years, and once updated the plan must complete
the formal State and FEMA review and participating jurisdiction adoption process. The local review and update were
completed in April 2022, and the State and FEMA Region 10 have completed their pre-adoption review and committed to
approve the plan upon receiving documentation of its adoption by participating jurisdictions.
Once adopted by participating jurisdictions and final approval is received from FEMA, the result will be an approved multijurisdictional, multi-hazard mitigation plan that meets federal mandates in the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106390) and establishes eligibility for hazard mitigation project funding under the hazard mitigation assistance grant program,
which provides pre and post-disaster grant opportunities.
Public Engagement
The planning update process included a 30-day Public Comment Period (Nov 7 - Dec 9, 2022) with notice posted on the district
website, the Clark Regional Emergency Services Agency (CRESA) website, and in The Columbian. There were no public
comments received.
Budget Impact
There is no immediate budget impact.
With the adoption of the updated NHMP, Battle Ground School District will be eligible to apply for specified grants.
