Re: North Cascades Institute/Mountain School Field Experience
Carl Cozier Elementary is requesting permission from the Bellingham School Board to attend a 3 day
learning experience for 5th graders, the North Cascade Institute's "Mountain School: Ecosystem
Explorations during the fall of the 2010-11 school year. This is a nationally recognized environmental
education program, located in North Cascades National Park. We have examined District policies
regarding overnight field trips and believe that this program and our plan meet all requirements.
The program is aligned with Washington State learning requirements, and addresses Grade 5
Benchmarks in reading, writing, communication, math, social studies, the arts, health and fitness, and
especially science. Learning is integrated across content areas with a main focus on understanding
ecosystems: their components, inputs and outputs. Students will plan and conduct simple investigations,
generate data by measurement and observation, then organize and use their data to construct
explanations that they will present to others for critical review. This systemic approach mirrors
Washington State's approach to science learning. Students will develop vocabulary through a natural
process of use and repetition in a variety of meaningful contexts. These experiences will assist them as
they take the science WASL in the spring.
Mountain School will be an experience in which we learn and practice many aspects of responsible
citizenship, including respecting the rights of others, cooperation, and interdependence. We will live these
practices as a group, and then see and learn about these same processes in larger natural communities.
The format of the learning is such that all students are successful, and we usually find that some of our
students who have more difficulty in a classroom setting get their chance to shine in this type of setting.
This type of experience is one that students will never forget, and will strengthen ties within the class
groups, which will give the students strong bases of support when they go off to middle school. Getting
up close and personal with nature in such a beautiful setting, and learning to see the interconnectedness
of all life will go a long way toward developing the attitudes that will make our students caring stewards of
our environment.
Our living quarters will be indoors in a state of the art environmental learning facility that will keep the
experience enjoyable even in inclement weather, and add to our safety. It also has allowed an expansion
of the program.

The dates for each of the three classes to attend will be September 20 22 and September 22 24. The
approximate cost for each class is $125 x 25 students and 3 parent chaperones per class, for a $10,500
total. This includes food, lodging, instruction, and materials. Transportation is estimated to cost an
additional $1800. We plan to ask each student to contribute $65. We will encourage the students to raise
funds over the summer through extra family chores or other additional efforts. We believe that this
additional effort on their part will help them value the experience, and begin to see the relationship
between work and getting what one wants. Every student will be allowed to attend, even in the event of
financial hardship. Student fees should raise about $5,460. In addition, we have received approximately
$1,000 in donations to subsidize the cost for families needing assistance. We are asking the PTA to pay
for our transportation and the remainder of the class fee. We estimate that total cost for the PTA to be
about $6,800. The PTA has expressed a willingness to support the enrichment program, subject to
School Board approval.

Explanation of Issue:
On May 20 we were pleased to receive bids from four highly qualified general contractors for the
construction of our new Aldrich Road Elementary School. The fact that four bidders responded to our
project, and that the bids were extremely competitive (a 3% variance between the first and second lowest
bidders), is an indicator that the lowest bid we received is an accurate reflection of the true cost to build
our new school. The $181 per square foot cost we received for our project is significantly less than the
$252 average cost per square foot for the 25 most recent elementary school projects which qualified for
state construction assistance. I am also pleased to report that the apparent low bid of $10,207,201, which
includes selected alternates, is within our total project budget.
We are pleased to have the opportunity to once again work with Tiger Construction Company of Everson.
As you know, Tiger Construction was the General Contractor for Wade King Elementary School.
I recommend that we award the Base Bid and Alternates 1, 2A, 4A, and 6 for the construction of the new
Aldrich Road Elementary School to Tiger Construction Company, as indicated in the attached bid recap
and made a part of the minutes.
Mr. Cowan and Mr. Babayan will attend our meeting on May 27 to answer any questions or provide you
with any additional information.

Acting Superintendent's
Recommendation: The Acting Superintendent recommends approval.
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Business and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
I am pleased to report that the Districts quest to acquire a future school site in the north end of the
district, which began in 2004, may finally be over.
We have agreed in principle to acquire approximately 14 acres from King Mountain Church. The
proposed agreement is well within the parameters you established and the proposed purchase price is
nearly $400,000 below the appraised value.
By approving the Purchase and Sale Agreement, you are authorizing the Superintendent to execute all
necessary documents and for staff to initiate more detailed due diligence activities associated with the
parcel.
It is important to note that funding for this proposed purchase comes from investment earnings and
surplus funding in the districts Capital Projects Fund dating back to 2000 or before and not from any
funds associated with our $67 million 2006 Bond Issue.
I recommend your approval of the Purchase and Sale Agreement between the district and King Mountain
Church.
