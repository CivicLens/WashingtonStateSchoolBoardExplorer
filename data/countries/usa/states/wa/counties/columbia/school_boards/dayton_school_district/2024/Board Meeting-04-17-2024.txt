Type :

Information

Public Content
The Dayton School District Policy #1430 addresses Audience Participation at a Meeting of the Board of
Education
AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION
The board of directors recognizes the value of public comment on educational issues and the importance
of involving members of the public in its meetings. In order to permit fair and orderly expression of such
comment, the board of directors will provide a period at the beginning of the meeting during which visitors
may make formal presentations. Such presentations should be scheduled in advance.
The board of directors will also allow individuals to express an opinion prior to board of directors action on
agenda items the board of directors determines require or will benefit from public comment. Written and
oral comment will be accepted by the board of directors before the adoption or amendment of policies not
expressly or by implication authorized by state or federal law, but which will promote the education of
kindergarten through twelfth grade students in public schools or will promote the effective, efficient or
safe management and operation of the district. Individuals wishing to be heard by the board of directors
shall first be recognized by the president. Individuals, after identifying themselves, will proceed to make
comments as briefly as the subject permits. Any representative of a firm eligible to bid on materials or
services solicited by the board of directors shall also be entitled to express an opinion. The president may
interrupt or terminate an individual's statement when it is too lengthy, personally directed, abusive,
obscene or irrelevant. The board of directors as a whole shall have the final decision in determining the
appropriateness of all such rulings.

Individuals with disabilities who may need a modification to participate in a meeting should contact the
superintendent's office no later than three days before a regular meeting and as soon as possible in
advance of a special meeting so that arrangements for the modification can be made.

Type :

Procedural

Public Content
Board of Education Policy 1410 addresses the convening of an Executive Session.
EXECUTIVE OR CLOSED SESSIONS
Before convening in executive session, the chairperson shall publicly announce the general purpose for
excluding the public from the meeting place and the time when the executive session will be concluded.
The executive session may be extended to a stated later time by announcement of the chairperson.
An executive session may be conducted for one or more of the following purposes:
A. To consider the selection of a site or the acquisition of real estate by lease or purchase when public
knowledge regarding such consideration would cause a likelihood of increased price;
B. To consider the minimum price at which real estate will be offered for sale or lease when public
knowledge regarding such consideration would cause a likelihood of decreased price; however, the final
action of selling or leasing public property shall be taken in a meeting open to the public;
C. To review negotiations on the performance of publicly-bid contracts when public knowledge regarding
such consideration would cause a likelihood of increased costs;
D. To receive and evaluate complaints or charges brought against a director or staff member; however,
upon the request of such director or staff member, a public hearing or a meeting open to the public shall
be conducted on such complaint or charge;
E. To evaluate the qualifications of an applicant for public employment or to review the performance of a
staff member; however, discussion of salaries, wages, and other conditions of employment to be
generally applied within the district shall occur in a meeting open to the public, and when the board of
directors elects to take the final action of hiring, setting the salary of an individual staff member or class of
staff members, or discharging or disciplining an employee, that action shall be taken in a meeting open to
the public;

F. To evaluate the qualifications of a candidate for appointment to the board of directors; however, any
interview of such candidate and final action appointing a candidate to the board of directors shall be in a
meeting open to the public; or
G. To discuss with legal counsel representing the district matters relating to district enforcement actions,
or litigation or potential litigation to which the district, the board of directors, or a member acting in an
official capacity is, or is likely to become, a party, when public knowledge regarding the discussion is
likely to result in an adverse legal or financial consequence to the district. Potential litigation means
matters protected by attorney-client privilege related to litigation that has been specifically threatened;
litigation that the district reasonably believes may be commenced; or the litigation or legal risks of a
proposed action or current practice of the district, if public discussion is likely to result in an adverse or
financial consequence to the district.
