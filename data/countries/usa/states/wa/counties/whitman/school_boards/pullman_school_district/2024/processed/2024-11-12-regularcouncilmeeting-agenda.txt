Recommended Action :

Staff recommends a motion and subsequent approval of the
attached resolution as presented raising the existing property
tax levy by the allowable legal limit factor as well as capturing
revenues related to new construction activities. In addition,
staff is requesting City Council authorization for the City
Finance Director to sign the associated documents for timely
submittal to Whitman County.

Public Content
Chapter 251, Laws of 1995, codified as RCW 84.55.120, requires that a public
hearing be conducted on revenue sources for the coming years budget, including the
consideration of possible increases in property tax revenues.
This public hearing occurred onSeptember 24, 2024. No public comment was offered
and there were noadditional comments received by the Finance Department in the
interim.
As part of that hearing, a discussion regarding the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD)
occurred. As per RCW 84.55.0101, when the IPD is above1%, cities can only adopt
to levy the1% above the highest lawful level since 1985 limit factor.
Although the City of Pullman has adopted a biennial budget process, property tax
levies are still set on a yearly basis and recorded with the Whitman County Assessor
on or before November 30thof each calendar year as per RCW 84.52.070.

Due to cost increases for City of Pullman government operations to provide services
and programs to the community, staff is recommending:
1) Capturing additional new revenue resulting from all new construction,
improvements to property, changes in assessed value, and any annexations;
2) Increasing the prior year levy amount by the statutory maximum rate of 1%
above the highest lawful levy since 1985
For the regular levy this amount would be:
2024 Highest Lawful Levy Since 1985: 7,744,236.78 x 1.01 = $7,821,679.15
2024 New Construction Projected Levy Amount = $123,382.58
Total to be collected for 2025 = $7,945,061.73
Preliminary Budget for 2025 Property Tax Levy = $7,867,336
The excess levy of $1,043,342 to repay the 2018 bond items is setby the repayment
schedule for principal and interest.

and process applications for new permits to occupy the right-of-way from businesses
on Main Street. Further discussion is needed with the City Council on these items.
