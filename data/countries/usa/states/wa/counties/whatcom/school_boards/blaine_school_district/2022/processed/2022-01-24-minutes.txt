  4. Reports
A. School Administrator Reports
Each school administrator provided a brief report to the board. There were no questions for Mr. Radke. Mr. VanderYacht added information to his report about teachers' efforts to prepare for the brief period of remote learning this week. Director Gibson asked Mr. Benson about the middle school's AVID and accreditation process and discussion followed. There was discussion regarding the high school's ASVAB testing participation, and Mr. Ellis provided more detail about the opportunity.
  B. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment through the month of January. Enrollment continues to remain below the budgeted level, and there was discussion regarding how this will impact revenue from the state for the remainder of the fiscal year. Ms. Porter reminded the board that enrollment revenue is paid based upon the budgeted figure until January at which time actual enrollment is used and any deficit is spread out over the remaining months of the year. Director Creydt asked Ms. Porter to explain the fluctuation in enrollment at the 6th grade level. Ms. Porter explained that there are many factors that tend to impact enrollment and she explained common trends that could account for fluctuations in any given cohort. Director Gibson asked about the budgeted enrollment level and Ms. Porter replied that this year's budgeted enrollment is 2,140 FTE. President Thomas asked about Bright K enrollment, and Ms. Porter explained that those students will be counted as kindergartners and she shared information about that program's funding.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a report on revenue and expenses through the month of December. She reviewed the expenses that run through each fund, and explained the revenue spikes that result from property tax payments collected in October and April. Ms. Porter described another revenue spike that will occur when federal ESSER funding is claimed. There was discussion regarding the time frame for submitting a claim for ESSER funding. Director Creydt expressed concern that Ms. Porter may miss the deadline, and she offered her assistance to ensure that the claim for funding is submitted in time. Ms. Porter assured her that ESSER funding will be claimed on an intentional schedule within the required time frame and discussion continued. Ms. Porter added clarification that ESSER funds cannot be claimed until the money is spent. Dr. Granger added comments about the intentionality of how ESSER funds have been budgeted over time.
  D. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
2022-2023 Planning: The calendar committee is considering options and expects to have a school calendar recommendation for the board to consider at the February meeting. Staffing considerations are also being reviewed.
Legislative Update: Several bills related to educational funding are being considered during this year's legislative session which is currently underway. Adjustments to the funding formula for Transportation have been requested in SB 5881. A new mandate is being proposed in HB 1664 related to nurse and counseling staff and OSPI is advocating for this mandate to be funded if imposed. HB 1226 would make it possible to pass a bond initiative with a simple majority which will be important for the district's future initiatives, particularly when voters are asked to fund construction of a school in Birch Bay. HB 2660 is intended to increase the availability of school meals at no cost. Enrollment stabilization funding is addressed in HB 2660 in response to declines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Granger explained the legislature's pending action to delay payroll deductions for the new Long Term Care tax. School districts have been advised to withhold these funds until the legislature takes formal action. Director Creydt asked if employees were given the option to buy their own plan to avoid the tax. Dr. Granger explained that the option was provided under a specific timeline that ended last November. Some employees were able to secure their own plan, however many providers stopped offering those plans.
Director District 5 Vacancy: The application deadline was on January 21. In order to increase the number of applicants in the pool for consideration, it was agreed that the deadline should be extended to February 4.
Future Meeting Items: Dr. Granger described the timeline for board consideration of contract renewal for the district's executive directors, administrators, and non-represented staff.
COVID Guidance: There has been a shift in the health authority guidance. The Test to Stay option has been expanded to include community exposures as well as school exposures. Staff members are also now able to participate in the Test to Stay program. Last week, the district performed an average of 150 tests per day, and Dr. Granger expressed his appreciation for the efforts of school nurses, as well as other staff members who stepped up to assist.
Remote Learning: Many hours went into the review of options last week, and it was determined by the leadership team that a brief period of remote learning was appropriate. Last week, campuses experienced positive case rates well in excess of 10% plus significant additional absences for both students and staff. While no one prefers remote learning, the hope is that this break will ensure that the district can staff buildings and departments when students return to in-person learning on January 31.
Upcoming Meetings: The next regular meeting is February 28, preceded by a work session for mid-year goal updates. There was discussion regarding the board's request last fall for a work session to review the 1000 series of policy updates. A work session is also on the calendar in March to review facility use and other policy priorities. There will be no change to the district's facility use fee schedule which is working well.

  7. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)

Director Creydt commented on recent meeting schedule adjustments, and she voiced a preference for consistency in the scheduling of board meetings. Director Gibson explained that the meeting schedule has historically been consistent, but greater flexibility has been required in recent times. President Thomas added that directors should be prepared for the possibility of meetings at multiple times late in the day on regular meeting dates.

There was discussion regarding the directors' availability for a work session to review the 1000 Series of policy updates recently provided by WSSDA as part of their Policy Manual Review service. Dr. Granger asked that any unavailable dates in February be provided to him before January 28, and a date for the work session would then be determined.

Director Creydt again asked to schedule discussion of the extra curricular issue brought up in public comments. Dr. Granger suggested that the issue first be discussed in the directors' small group meetings with him, and then discussed at the board's upcoming policy work session in the context of the 1000 series policy updates.

There was discussion regarding the limited number of applications received for the board's vacant position. All agreed that a pool of multiple candidates to choose from would be desirable, and the application deadline should be extended. A special meeting will need to be scheduled in February for director candidate interviews which would take place in an open public meeting.
