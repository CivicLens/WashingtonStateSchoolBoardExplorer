  D. Budget Status and Financial Report
Director of Finance Keith Yaich provided a written report regarding revenue and expenses through the month of October. Year-end reports for 2023-2024 were attached to the agenda, including the F-196 Annual Financial Statement. He also provided a verbal explanation of the 2023-2024 year-end reports during the meeting, addressing the ending balance for each account. Mr. Yaich commended the board and the district for making the hard choices to practice conservative spending.

President Freeman and Director Creydt expressed appreciation for Mr. Yaich's report. It was noted that Mr. Yaich's monthly Financial Report was inadvertently not attached to the agenda prior to the meeting, and it was then uploaded as an agenda attachment. President Freeman described it as "amazing" that the 2023-2024 fiscal year ended so close to the budgeted target. He expressed appreciation for Amber Porter's work in developing the budget and managing the finances prior to her departure, and also thanked the district's business office staff for their work in managing the district's funds. He acknowledged the difficulty resulting from the district's staffing reduction and commended the district for fulfilling their commitment to fiscal responsibility.
  E. WSSDA Conference Review
The following individuals shared a summary of information learned at the WSSDA Annual Conference:
Director Lazarus noted that school district representatives statewide acknowledged the challenges facing education, yet the legislature's focus continues to be on other issues with no priority on fixing the issues in education funding. He emphasized that it is a difficult time to be in education and he expressed gratitude for attending the conference.
Director Swinburnson found the seminars informative and engaging, echoing Director Lazarus' point that many districts across the state are struggling. He referenced one district struggling with leadership turnover and noted his observation that the successful districts are those where staff, boards, administrators, and the community are all pulling in the same direction.
Director Galbraith found the conference valuable for its focus on the importance of relationships, noting that other districts, like Blaine, are facing not only financial struggles but also a lack of civility. He emphasized that while criticism from a distance doesn't help, robust conversation is important, and the district should focus on what can be done for students. He observed that other boards and communities who faced incivility didn’t let it derail their efforts for students, and he expressed his passion for both the well-being of students and for the dedicated staff in Blaine schools. He stressed the need for civil conversations and working together in the same direction.
President Freeman appreciated the chance to meet others, build relationships, and bond as a board. This was his second time attending the WSSDA conference, and he echoed comments about other districts facing challenges. He described his learning at the law conference, gaining new perspective on the issue of boys playing girls sports. He stated that he would support a coach forfeiting a match if girls were in danger, emphasizing the importance of understanding that state law is at the core of the Title IX and gender identity issue. He shared information about another school district that faced a superintendent loss, a labor strike, and transportation issues, concluding that it was valuable to hear about challenges elsewhere, reaffirming that Blaine is in good shape.
  F. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Presentations were provided in November at the Supper with the Superintendent event as well as the Staff Advisory Committee. The focus has been on the upcoming legislative session. Dr. Granger described a grassroots effort by local parents to set up a townhall in Blaine, and he will coordinate with the three legislative offices to set a date. Director Swinburnson asked if all three state legislators had expressed interest in participating in the townhall, and Dr. Granger affirmed.
A third-grade teacher was added due to increased enrollment at that grade level. However, the district will not reach the threshold for K-3 funding because the cost of adding the necessary staff exceeds the funding the district would receive.
The monthly K-5 Literacy update was provided. Dr. Granger described a parent survey and referenced three curriculum options being considered (ARC, myView, and CKLA). The committee meets again on December 9, and the goal is to pilot a curriculum in the spring of 2025.
Additional Title IX updates were provided at the WSSDA Law Conference. Dr. Granger explained how different Title IX regulations are followed at Blaine Primary School. The district will start using Guardian software to track Title IX complaints.
Whatcom County’s 11.4% property tax increase may impact future local school funding initiatives. Additionally, the city is proposing tax increases, which will need to be considered. The Facilities Committee will reconvene in January to discuss next steps, with a deadline of February 21 to submit a board resolution to the County Auditor for the April election.
Despite the bond initiative's failure, Dr. Granger expressed appreciation for all who voted. Across the state, only two bonds passed with the 60% super majority while most would have passed if only a simple majority was required. President Freeman recalled that the high school bond took three attempts to pass before succeeding.
