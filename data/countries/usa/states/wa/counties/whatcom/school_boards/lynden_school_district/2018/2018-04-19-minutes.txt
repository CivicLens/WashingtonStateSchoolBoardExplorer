• Board Linkage
Jim Frey introduced the World Café linkage activity to engage Lynden School District staff and board
members. The linkage activity was based on the questions: What is successful in the District?; What are
areas for improvement in the District?; As we grow, what do we need to be aware of? Staff shared their
thoughts on these questions and had good discussion amongst their peers. Board members and
Administration thanked the attendees and the feedback for future direction of the Lynden School District.
