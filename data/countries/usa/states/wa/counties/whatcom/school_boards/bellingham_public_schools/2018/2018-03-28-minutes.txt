POLICY GOVERNANCE REVIEW
Board Response to Monitoring – EL-9 – Asset Maintenance and Protection: At the
Mar. 14, 2018 regular meeting, the consent agenda included a monitoring report and data
set on EL-9, Asset Maintenance and Protection. In accordance with Policy Governance,
the board discussed whether the superintendent is in compliance with the policy and
whether any policy changes are needed. (See Attachment B for a summary of comments.)
Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities, and Mike
Anderson, Buildings and Grounds Director, participated in the discussion and answered
questions from the board. Summary of comments:
 Mr. Cowan said the district has made tremendous strides in energy efficiency and
resource conservation, thanks in large measure to Mr. Anderson’s efforts. The
district follows Washington Sustainable Schools Protocol for all new
construction. This has many positive outcomes; for example, Happy Valley
Elementary School is the most energy efficient school in the district. Additionally,
our district, along with other community partners, helped the City of Bellingham
finish third in the nation in the Georgetown University Energy Prize.
 Ms. Diaz Hackler suggested families and community members be informed of
this work and related cost savings, perhaps through an article on the district
website.
 The board discussed a proposed change in the EL-9 policy to include stronger
language related to energy conservation efforts. Following discussion, it was
agreed that the policy should not be changed at this time.
