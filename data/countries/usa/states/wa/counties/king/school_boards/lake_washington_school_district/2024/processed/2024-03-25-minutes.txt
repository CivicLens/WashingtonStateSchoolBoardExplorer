1. Redirecting 2022 Construction Levy Proceeds And Matching Funds Resolution No. 2365
Resolution 2365 authorizes the 2022 capital construction levy proceeds and State Construction Assistance Program (SCAP) funds to be redirected so that they can be used for up to a 12-classroom additions and core space modifications at Eastlake High School (Site 86) and Redmond High School (Site 85). This funding was part of the 2022 Building Excellence Levy for high school capacity for 600 students on the east side of the district. This is the first reading of Resolution 2365. This Resolution will be brought to the Board for action at their April 15, 2024 meeting.
  2. WSSDA Positions - Discussion and Vote
Annually, the Washington State School Directors Association (WSSDA) creates, revises and confirms Permanent and Legislative Positions. Permanent positions are those positions that "represent WSSDA’s beliefs and values and indicate WSSDA’s stance on issues of widespread concern for its membership. The permanent positions are advisory to individual school boards and the greater community." Legislative positions are those that are, "WSSDA’s call to action directed at the state Legislature. These member-ratified positions define and direct the work of WSSDA’s staff as they engage with legislators in Olympia to support public education."
The LWSD Board is recommending revision to current positions and the adoption of new positions.
Climate Impact Mitigation Assistance: Revisions to existing legislative position to be more general about alternative fuels (rather than just specifying electric) and encourage funding for non-vehicle related costs e.g. infrastructure.
Funding Safe, Healthy, Contemporary School Buildings: Revisions to existing legislative position to add language supporting contracting indebtedness to construct new school buildings (i.e., LGO bonds).
Literacy: Two positions – one permanent, one legislative – affirming literacy as a civil right and encouraging funding for evidence-based literacy practices. These positions are being worked on in collaboration with the Shoreline School District Board of Directors.
The Board approved these positions. These positions will now be submitted by Director Guthrie on behalf of the Board for consideration by the WSSDA Membership at General Assembly in September 2024.

RESOLUTION: The Board adopts the proposed WSSDA positions as presented.
Motion by Eric Laliberte, second by Lindsey Yocum.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
  The board took a short recess at 8:37 p.m. and resumed at 8:48 p.m.
