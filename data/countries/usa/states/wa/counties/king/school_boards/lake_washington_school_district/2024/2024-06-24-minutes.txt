  E. Non-Consent Agenda
  1. 2023-24 Budget Extension and Public Hearing
When the Board of Directors approved the 2023-24 budget in August 2023, it established the maximum level of expenditures the district could incur. That maximum level was established based on information that was known at the time and prior expenditure patterns. As a result of both revenues and expenditures related to the special education high-cost Safety Net Award, transportation and new accounting requirements for subscription and lease financing, there is a possibility that actual expenditures may exceed the general fund budgeted amount. 
Accordingly, staff has proposed a budget extension to increase the appropriation limit by $12,000,000. The beginning fund balance and additional revenues received during the year provide the funds necessary to meet this expenditure level. The appropriate public notices have been published in the local newspaper.

The Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 2379, increasing the 2023-24 General Fund appropriation amount from $556,155,096 to $568,155,096.
  RESOLUTION:  Adopt Resolution No. 2379 increasing the 2023-24 General Fund appropriation amount from $556,155,096 to $568,155,096.
Motion by Eric Laliberte, second by Lindsey Yocum.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries

The public comment period is June 24 to August 4. Budget documents will be posted on the district website.
