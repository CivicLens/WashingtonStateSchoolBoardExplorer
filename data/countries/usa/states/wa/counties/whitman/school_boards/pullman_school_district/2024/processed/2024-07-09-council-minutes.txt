M. Public Hearing

N. Regular Agenda
Public Works Director Sean Wells explained at the August 9, 2022, City Council meeting
that the Council authorized and designated Gooch Thermal Inc. as the sole source
provider for the Primary Digester Heat Exchangers at the Waste Water Treatment Plant
(WWTP) following the procurement procedures contained in Pullman City Code
1.107.110(3).
A capital improvement project to replace the aging heat exchangers at the WWTP has
been approved and is budgeted for 2024. The heat exchanger provides heat for the
digestion process needed to meet the State of Washington Department of Ecology
biosolids permit requirements. The city must maintain the time and temperature
requirements via digestion so the biosolids can be disposed of yearly. The only direct
replacement option for the heat exchanger is the Gooch model 1000K by Gooch Thermal
Systems Inc., which is the current heat exchanger model. To use a different heat
exchanger make and model, the piping and pump configuration at the plant must be
redesigned and reconstructed, which would be far more expensive and time-consuming
than replacing the existing heat exchanger with the same make and model.
Action, Motion: 1.

A motion to authorize the execution of a Sole Source Contract with Gooch
Thermal Systems Inc. for a replacement Heat Exchanger for the Wastewater
Treatment Plant.
Motion by Ann Parks, second by Nathan Weller.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Nathan Weller, Pat Wright, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira
Action, Motion: 2.
A motion to authorize Transit staff to apply for funding assistance for two new
electric buses and planning and design work associated with a new Transit
facility.
Motion by Carla De Lira, second by Eric Fejeran.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Nathan Weller, Pat Wright, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira
O. Discussion Items
Discussion Items: 1. Work Group Selection
Due to Mayor Benjamin's absence, Councilmember Parks moved, and Councilmember
Weller seconded to table the work group selection discussion to a future meeting.
Motion by Ann Parks, second by Nathan Weller.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Nathan Weller, Pat Wright, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira
P. New Business
