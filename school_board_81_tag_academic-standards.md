The Mercer Island School District Board of Directors held a special meeting on October 11, 2024, to discuss Board Policy 1800 OE-1, which focuses on personalized learning, and to review the iReady Math assessment tool under Board Policy 1800 OE-10. Superintendent Fred Rundle introduced Dr. Ray Smith to lead a discussion on the importance of effective teaching practices, emphasizing the need for potential revisions to the policy language to broaden the focus from "personalized learning" to "learning" as a whole. The Board acknowledged the necessity of defining the "why," "how," and "what" of the policy and discussed metrics to monitor progress, such as the percentage of teachers whose students show significant growth. In the afternoon, discussions centered on the iReady assessment tool, with representatives from Curriculum Associates presenting its adaptive nature and the importance of using multiple data sources for comprehensive student evaluations. The Board expressed the need for clear measures and monitoring systems to enhance instructional decisions.
