## 2024-11-01 - FERNDALE_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Ferndale School District No. 502 held a special session on January 24, 2023, to discuss the filling of a vacant school board director position (Director Position No. 3).  The vacancy arose from Jessie Deardorff's resignation on November 20, 2022. The board outlined the process for filling the vacancy as per Policy 1114P, which required selecting five candidates from the applicant pool for interviews. However, the board struggled to reach a consensus on five candidates and ultimately voted to suspend policy 1114P to interview only four candidates: Cindy Cultee, Katie Dorr, Patricia Dunn, and Toni Jefferson. The decision to deviate from the established policy highlights potential challenges in the board's selection process and the need for clear communication and agreement among members.  The board received significant parental feedback via email regarding the candidates, which influenced their decision-making process.

## 2021-12-07 - BLAINE_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Blaine School District No. 503 held a special board meeting on December 7, 2021 to discuss and finalize a redistricting plan for the district. The board had previously met on November 22, 2021, and heard concerns from Birch Bay patrons regarding the initial draft redistricting plan. In response to these concerns, Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger and Redistricting Project Manager Robert Schweitzer worked together to develop an alternate plan that addressed the community's desire for better representation. The alternate plan was presented at the meeting and received positive feedback from both board members and Birch Bay residents.

The board discussed the benefits of the alternate plan, which included more compact districts within Birch Bay and a clearer alignment with community interests. Concerns were raised about the historical lack of candidates from Birch Bay and the displacement of the current director in District 4 due to the redistricting. It was clarified that the displaced director would be allowed to complete their current term.

The alternate plan was ultimately supported by both the board and the Birch Bay community, with residents expressing appreciation for the district's willingness to listen to their concerns and address them in a constructive manner. The board agreed to further discuss the redistricting plan at their December 14 meeting.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting was conducted remotely. The resolution proposed increasing the Replacement Maintenance & Operations levy collection for 2022 to $6,082,990, revising the originally projected amount of $5,909,503 in the 2021-22 Budget.

Director McKinney expressed concern about potential negative impact on the district's image due to exceeding the initially projected levy amount.
