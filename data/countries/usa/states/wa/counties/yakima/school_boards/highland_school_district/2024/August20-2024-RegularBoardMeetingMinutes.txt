e. Budget Status /Enrollment and Operations Report: Francis: For the end of July, we are looking very
good due to some changes we made going back to February: reorganizing staff, utilizing what we have
instead of new purchases, and other steps taken all of which contributed to our current status. There are
some things that we still need to do to ensure we don’t go over budget, and we’ll see how the [current
fiscal] year ends. The GF is still OK at $2.1M, a bit higher than one year ago, CP $1.350M, ASB $184K,
Transportation $158K and Debt Service $372K. Many small projects were completed over the summer:
The refinished/painted awnings and doors look really good, the new lighting is great and enhances safety
and security. MWC has new playground equipment and the kitchen has some new upgrades, these last
two were purchased with a grant that Francis wrote last year.
f. Personnel Report: Mark: We have one resignation by a newly hired teacher that decided to take a job
in another district, three leaves for family or medical reasons, several of the para positions have been
filled, short list of extracurricular hires plus Kelly Fitzpatrick to be the MS AD in addition to teaching at
the MS. Not hiring an event supervisor this year. We have been not able to fill the Speech Language
Pathologist position. Cindy moved to accept the August 20, 2024 Personnel Report as presented, Carlos
2nd; motion carried.
