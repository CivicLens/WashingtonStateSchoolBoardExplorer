OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
April 14, 2021 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Mason called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. She acknowledged that this meeting,
while attended from various locations, is being held on the ancestral homelands of the
Coast Salish people. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz
Hackler, Jenn Mason (President), Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day
(recorder). Director Katie Rose was unable to attend.
Audience:
Ms. Mason noted that, because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19, public
participation is limited to written submissions only, and all written comments received
will be shared with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all messages
received.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
The study session portion of the meeting will be moved up in the agenda, following the
superintendent’s report.
There are nine weeks of the school year remaining. The state superintendent and the
Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) are working with the federal
government on state testing, and it was announced today that the Smarter Balanced
Assessment test (SBAC) will not be given this spring.
Executive Director of Operations Jessica Sankey gave an update on vaccines. More BPS
staff have been vaccinated and all have been given the opportunity to get the COVID-19
vaccine. Beginning tomorrow, 16 and older are eligible for vaccinations. We are working
with local health providers to help facilitate opportunities to get eligible students the
Pfizer vaccine if they are interested. At this point, there is not a requirement for students
to get vaccinated to attend school; those decisions are usually made at the state level by
public health officials. Dr. Baker and Ms. Sankey responded to questions from board
members.
All students are now eligible to be back for in-person learning, and it is anticipated that
there will be an announcement soon regarding increased in-person time for students
within the health parameters that have been given. We expect some families will continue
with remote learning. This should be the last schedule adjustment for the 2020-21 school
year.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
There were so many changes and updates to policies due to the pandemic. The board recognizes
all of the hard work and planning done by so many. This includes pivoting HR activities to
remote alternatives, providing online professional development, shifting the volunteer coordinator
to meet food and internet needs, and managing staffing as families’ remote/in-person needs and
preferences shifted over the school year. There was also commendable work done to avoid
substitute shortages that affected many other districts in our state. The Board also recognizes
excellent work to support newer educators and to gain agreements with the BEA and BAO for
contracts. In hiring the new Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Director, the district also shows
continued commitment to addressing equity issues.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
No areas identified.
4. Comments on the report itself.
The Board appreciates all of the examples and the comprehensive nature of this report and the
examples showing how our superintendent is in compliance with EL-4.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
With widespread concern about learning loss due to the pandemic, this report shows the
outstanding work done to engage students and mitigate this concern. The MAP data looks
promising in terms of showing that significant learning loss did not occur in the early part of the
pandemic—and shows that there may have even been gains. The Board appreciates the long list
of activities initiated to address math scores.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
•
•

Continued work to address the impact of issues affecting student subgroups that lead to
achievement gaps.
Continued improvement on lagging math scores.

4. Comments on the report itself.
The Board appreciates the many examples of strategies being used to address achievement gaps
and engage in high-quality math instruction. The Board also appreciates the creativity in
identifying new data measurements as other testing data was not available, due to the pandemic.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• BPS moved from near the state average in 2010 to above the state average in 2019.
• Dropout rate continued to decline.
• Five-year graduation rates for students eligible for free/reduced meals increased from 68% to
82%, while dropout rates fell from 29% to 11%.
• Graduates with IEPs enroll in higher education at rates higher than the state average.
DB:
• Notable that the 5-year graduation rate reached 90 percent.
• Noted continued decreasing trend in dropout rates.
• Clear progress with some subgroups, ELL, IEP, FR lunch (low income) and students of color.
• Noted the continuing trend of increasing enrollment in dual credit coursed by ELL, low
income and students of color.
CDH:
• The board appreciates the work done to encourage and add opportunities for students to
participate in dual credit courses.
JM:

Really positive work to improve 5-year graduation rates and decrease dropout rates for
students with low incomes.
Steady improvements in closing graduation gap for Hispanic/Latinx students and students
with low incomes.
Continuing positive trends for students earning dual enrollment credits.
Significant increase in the number of students earning industry certificates.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
KB:
• Graduation rates for ELL students.
DB:
• As post high school options broaden beyond traditional post-secondary education (i.e.,
college), it might be useful to track where all students go. This may shed some light on the
fluctuating numbers. The broadening of post-secondary options may also have future policy
implications.
CDH:
• The board would like to see higher graduation rates among our students who receive free and
reduced meals.
JM:
• Recognizing that it is a small group and the data is subject to fluctuation, continued
improvement for graduation rates for ELL students.
4. Comments on the report itself.
KB:
• Appreciate the data and the graphs included in the report.
DB:
• It seems that year after year the breadth and “granularity” of the data for this report gets better
and better. The board appreciates this effort, it helps deepen our understanding of graduation
and post-graduation outcomes.
CDH:
• The superintendent and his team really do a great job tracking down data and materials to
share with the board.
JM:
• Appreciate the contextual information regarding the analysis of why students have dropped
out.
• Since it has come up in our meetings, it might be helpful to include information about the
number of students/trends in Community Transitions.
5. Possible changes to the policy.
DB:
• See number 3 above.
