In addition, the board was requested to approve the minutes from the March 27,
2024 Regular Board Meeting and the exhibited Out of Endorsement Course Assignments. Director Moore moved for approval of the consent agenda. Director Heller seconded the motion. The Board vote was unanimous.
4.02 Monthly Enrollment and Finance Report (Exhibit) (Information) – Business Manager José Domenech presented to the Board the April enrollment and monthly
budget report through March 2024.
4.03 Comprehensive School Counseling Plan (Exhibit) (Information) – Senate Bill
5030 requires districts to develop and implement a comprehensive school counseling program. Special Services Director Dr. Becky Bell presented the comprehensive school counseling plan.
4.04 Resolution 24-005 180-day School Year Waiver for 3 Days of Professional Development (Exhibit) (Action) – Although Resolution 24-003 180-day School Year
Waiver for January Snow Days was approved at the March 27, 2024 regular school
board meeting; we were advised to apply for a 180-day school year waiver based
on professional development days rather than snow days. Thus, a new resolution
was required. RCW 28A.150.220 requires that there is a minimum of 180 school
days per year. However, OSPI allows school districts to apply for a waiver to the
180-day school year requirement in order for the district to implement a local plan
to provide for all students an effective education system designed to improve student achievement by enhancing the educational program for all students in the
district. The San Juan Island School District conducted staff professional development training on August 28, 29, and 30, 2023 which enhanced the educational
program for all students in the district. For this reason, the Board was requested to
approve Resolution 24-005 allowing the Superintendent to apply for a waiver to the
180-day school year requirement based on professional development days. Director Heller moved for approval of resolution 24-005. Director Moore seconded the
motion. The Board vote was unanimous.

Director Moore moved for approval of the revisions. Director Bevens seconded the
motion. The Board vote was unanimous.
5.03 Approval of WIAA Resolution 24-004 for 2024-2025 (Exhibit) (Action) – By action
of the 1976 Legislature, each School District Board of Directors may delegate control, supervision, and regulation of any extracurricular activity to the WIAA and
compensate such entity for services provided. Annual approval of a resolution is
required. The Superintendent recommended approval of Resolution 24-004, Delegating Authority to WIAA.
