Re: School Board Study Session 7/22/2024
___________________________________________________
I will hold a Study Session on Monday, 7/22/2024 for the purpose of sharing information and to develop a comprehensive
understanding of Capital Projects operations and budgets, including the previous two bond issues and the current capital levy. I
will also share historical information regarding the current Facilities Master Plan, as well as the preceding 2005 Master Plan, and
the process that guided their creation and implementation. The study session will be concluded with a board discussion
regarding the work conducted by the Long-Range Facilities Planning Committee and Sustainable Action Planning Committee
during the 2023/2024 school year.
