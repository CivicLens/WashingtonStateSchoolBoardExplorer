Recommended Action :

I move to approve the student placement at SPERO
Center for $326,000 for the 24/25 school year.

Public Content
SPERO CENTER, a day treatment program located in Vancouver, WA, and operated by ESD 112, offers
therapeutic services for students experiencing internalizing psychopathologies, such as anxiety and
depression. SPERO is designed for students who have not made sufficient progress in managing their
disabilities, making it difficult to succeed in less restrictive environments. The program provides a
structured, supportive setting where students can develop coping strategies tailored to their unique
emotional and psychological needs.
Placement in a public day school occurs when its determined that the district is unable to provide
appropriate education services within one of its educational programs. The Special Services Department
requests board approval to place a student there during the 2024-2025 school year. The estimated cost
for placing students at SPERO during the current school year is $326,000.

FLORENS ACADEMY is a specialized day treatment program in Vancouver, WA, operated by ESD 112.
It provides targeted behavioral and adaptive services for neurodivergent students whose externalizing
behaviors significantly impact their learning and that of their peers in less restrictive settings. Offering a
more intensive level of professional support than is typically available in neighborhood schools, this
program fosters a structured environment that promotes both academic and social-emotional growth,
helping students develop the skills they need for long-term success.
