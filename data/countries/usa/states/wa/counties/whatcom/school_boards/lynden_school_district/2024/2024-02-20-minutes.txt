3. Public Input
The board received four written comments regarding the capital facilities bond and reviewed
those individually during the meeting.
A community member addressed the board regarding the general obligations bond that recently
failed in the February election. He expressed that he believed the bond is a worthy investment
and urged the board to run the bond again in April.
A community member addressed the board regarding their duties as elected officials and how
their time and energy should be spent.
A staff member & community member expressed his desire for the board to put the bond out to
vote again. He explained that teaching in new well-thought and well-designed facility is
profoundly more impactful to students. The need is there. Children will be effected by this bond

in a positive way. He also inquired about whether the board could advocate for the bond in their
positions as directors.

4. Board Workshop
Discussion was held regarding whether to place the general obligations on the April ballot.
Topics included timelines and options for future elections, scope of projects, low voter turnout.
Other factors for consideration that were brought up and considered were the tight timeline and
whether that would allow the board and the district to perform their due diligence in decision
making and communicating. However, the longer we wait the more it will cost.
There was acknowledgment that more information needs to be communicated so that the
community understands the bond process. An April ballot measure would not allow for the
opportunity to engage with community members about the bond as needed.
