Congratulations to LHS student, Alex Wazny. He was named as the Regional Saxophone Winner at the San Juan Music
Educators Association's Solo & Ensemble Contest. He is headed to the state competition!
Over 150 Lynden Academy students and their parents visited the Lynden Heritage Museum in January. It was Lynden
Academy's best attended field trip since pre-Covid.
High schoolers from Lynden Christian have been visiting Fisher Elementary's Kindergarten and Transition to Kindergarten
classes every Thursday afternoon. This is part of LC's Plus Time program involving community service. High schoolers help the
younger students learn lessons about arts and crafts time, sharing, manners, taking turns and playing games. As LC begins their
2nd semester, a new group of students will be visiting Fisher kindergarteners as well as Isom Elementary kindergarteners.
Lynden Academy welcomed 23 new students at the semester change.
Congratulations to the FBLA team! Their participation in the FLBA Northwest Regional Conference resulted in 19 students
