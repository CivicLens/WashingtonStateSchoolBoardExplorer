Explanation of Issue:

Dykeman Architects are 95% complete with the construction/bid documents for the Birchwood Elementary School project.
Within the next few weeks, the documents will be 100% complete and ready to be provided to the prospective bidders. Prior to
doing so, we need Board authorization to call for bids on this project.
We anticipate the bid process will run from mid-April to mid-May at which time we will make a recommendation to the Board for
award of the lowest responsible bid. We anticipate construction will start in June 2013 with Substantial Completion in July 2014
in order for students and staff to occupy the building for the 2014-15 school year.
I request Board authorization to call for bids for the Birchwood Elementary School project.
