Lake Washington School Districts Building Excellence Plan is a multi-phase plan to provide
permanent classrooms for students, address aging facilities and reduce reliance on portables.
Phase I of the Building Excellence Plan was approved by voters in February 2022. Phase II will
focus on aging facilities with a goal of rebuilding/enlarging the four remaining schools that have
not received upgrades or rebuilds since the start of the 1998 modernization program.
The board considered recommendations, received information, and feedback in five study
sessions between March 2023 and March 2024. The Facility Advisory Committee provided
feedback on recommendations for future facility planning to accommodate our changing
enrollment landscape and continue to provide learning environments that promote excellence for
students.

An overview of the Construction Levy recommendation will be presented to the board of
directors at the regularly scheduled meeting on May 20, 2024. Board action on the measure is
scheduled for June 3, 2024.
Draft Resolution No. 2375, Construction Levy, authorizes a six-year levy to be placed on the
November 5, 2024 ballot.
The county requires notification of at least 60 days prior to the election date in order to certify the
measures for inclusion on the ballot. The deadline for the November 5 election is August 6, 2024.
