HB 2180 Increasing the special education enrollment funding cap: Director Creydt thinks it's great that more money will be coming, and she stated her opinion that the lack of funding is impacting students' ability to receive special education services.

SB 5462 Promoting inclusive learning standards and instructional materials in public schools.

  Director Creydt also mentioned bills related to gun safety and financial literacy education.
  E. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Levy and Bond Initiatives: Informational presentations have been provided to various community organizations. A brochure with information will arrive in local mailboxes this week. Both The Northern Light and Cascadia Daily News have provided good coverage on the initiatives.
Capital Facilities Project Update: Documents are being prepared in support of Whatcom County's growth study, which the board will consider at the December meeting. The district is also working with Whatcom County on a potential property for the school site in Birch Bay. Discussion continued regarding the process of determining feasibility for a property to be developed as a school site.
Budget Planning: Presentations are being provided at mandatory staff meetings on each school campus to ensure that all staff members are aware of the district's consideration of a $2.7M budget reduction in the 2024-2025 school year. This presentation will also be provided to families at the Supper with the Superintendent event on January 30.
High School Water Leak: A sprinkler system pipe broke during the weekend when weather temperatures were extremely cold. This resulted in a significant water leak. Dr. Granger expressed appreciation for the many staff members who came to help clean up the mess so that there would be minimal impact to students on the following school day.
Technology Update: WiFi access on buses is being considered to allow students to access learning resources on long trips. The district is also considering a change in mobile phone service providers.
WIAA Classification: Blaine will remain in the 1A classification for the 2024-2028 cycle.
Legislative Issues: There have been over 1000 new bills introduced, on top of the 1200 bills carried over from the last session. Dr. Granger shared comments regarding the following legislative issues:
SB 6223 Updating school district director compensation
HB 2458 Making experience factor adjustments for certificated instructional staff: This bill would provide for a transparent, yearly review of the district's experience mix factor which could restore significant funding that was lost.
SB 5956 Concerning the maximum per-pupil limit for enrichment levies: This bill would allow the district to access significant additional levy revenue, which it has capacity for, by adding the regionalization factor to the district's allowable levy collection.
A bill related to MSOC under-funding would address the state's failure to keep up with actual costs for basic operational expenses, like utilities and insurance, which are under-funded.
Enrollment & staffing comparison: Along with many other school districts, Blaine is monitoring its declining net cash positions. Discussion followed regarding the other districts currently in binding conditions.
SB 6014 Increasing the special education enrollment funding cap: In response to Director Creydt's request at the January 11 budget meeting, Dr. Granger provided specific details about the district's increased special education services in recent years.
There are multiple bills addressing prototypical school formulas, including SB 5882 (HB 1960) and HB 1741. Dr. Granger explained the uncertain long-term funding mechanism related to the increased salary for paraeducators.
HB 2212 is sponsored by Alicia Rule and addresses increased allocations for building-level administrators.
HB 2239 is sponsored by Joe Timmons and addresses the need for social emotional learning without creating another unfunded mandate.
SB 5966 and HB 1479 both address restraint and isolation of students, but differ on how that is defined and on its allowable use in schools. SEIU is following this matter because of its impact on members. Dr. Granger expressed concern about defining "restraint and isolation" in a way that includes clearing a classroom or walking a student down the hall.
SB 5823 and HB 1843 address school district elections by seeking to lower the current 60% super majority threshold for passing a bond initiative.
HB 5873 Providing adequate and predictable student transportation: This bill addresses under-funding and lack of transparency in the state's formula for school transportation funding.
HB 1368 would require the district to start purchasing electric buses in 2027. Concerns were discussed regarding reliability, availability, and the potential strain on the local infrastructure.
SB 5059 Concerning prejudgment interest: This bill would allow a judgment to bear interest from the date of an incident regardless of the agency's awareness of the incident. This topic has been considered in prior years and has returned for the current session. The Washington Schools Risk Management Pool has asked that schools be protected from this requirement.
SB 5793 would broaden the use of sick leave.
SB 6045 seeks to consolidate districts across the state to improve efficiency. Dr. Granger commented on the possibility that this is because of the number of districts in dire financial straits.
Signatures are being gathered to put a school voucher initiative on the November ballot. This could result in further revenue losses for the district.
Missed School Days: In the spring, the district will follow OSPI's protocols for considering a waiver of the days missed last week due to winter weather.
Future School Calendars: Dr. Granger provided details regarding the teachers' vote on calendar options for 2024-25 and 2025-26. Discussion followed regarding the concept of a balanced calendar.
  Director Ford suggested sharing information in a weekly newsletter to inform parents about bills that they should be aware of. Discussion followed regarding the large volume of bills impacting schools, and it was agreed that it would be best to focus on only the most impactful bills.
  Director Creydt asked when the Healthy Youth Survey data would be available, and Dr. Granger indicated he would look into that and share the information with the board at a future meeting.

  7. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)
A. General Comments
Director Creydt asked about the new requirement to record meetings, and Dr. Granger indicated that options were being considered for this to begin after the requirement takes effect on June 30, 2024.

Director Freeman stated that he has come to realize the importance of providing the Birch Bay community with a local school site, and he is now in full support of purchasing property for that purpose. Director Creydt added a comment regarding the difficulty of getting past the train hold-up when driving kids to school.

Vice President Lazarus shared comments regarding his new understanding that the board's meeting is held in the public, but it is not a meeting of the public. He now understands that each director has opportunities outside of the meeting to have individual conversations, to review the agenda materials ahead of time, and to ask questions when clarification is needed. Those preparations prior to the meeting inform the action taken by the board, in view of the public, during the meeting.

Vice President Lazarus further acknowledged the district's need for significant budget reductions in the coming school year, and he suggested a meeting for the purpose of receiving input from the public on budget reduction considerations. Director Freeman acknowledged the importance of seeking more input. Director Ford cautioned the board to ensure that this could be done according to legal requirements. Discussion continued regarding the method for planning such a meeting. Dr. Granger described the opportunity that has been provided for staff to submit input in a survey format, and he asked for more specificity about what kind of feedback would be desired by the board, as well as the board's desired outcome.

Vice President Lazarus also commented on the critical need for the EP&O Levy to pass. If it doesn't pass, the district would go from a $2.7M shortfall to a shortfall of over $9M.

Vice President Lazarus commented on his support for teachers, being a teacher himself. He then described his efforts to research claims made by the teachers' union last spring. Although the district has provided clear transparency with their calculations, the WEA has denied his requests to evaluate the calculations in support of their claims. Director Creydt asked if the district's new Finance Director should be ready to answer questions, and a reminder was provided regarding the value of asking questions ahead of time to allow for thoughtful answers. Vice President Lazarus referred to comments he has heard from teachers who feel that their union representatives ignored their desire to prioritize positions over salary increases in negotiations last year, and he noted that teacher salaries have increased significantly more than student enrollment revenue in recent years. Vice President Lazarus stated that, although he left the April 2023 board meeting believing the district was sitting on millions of dollars, he now understands that the claim was unfounded and that budget reductions were indeed necessary.

Director Freeman expressed his appreciation for the words of recognition in honor of Board Appreciation Month.
