# Meeting Summaries for MEAD_SCHOOL_DISTRICT with Tag: parental-rights

## 2024-02-26 - MEAD_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Board of Directors discussed the review and revision of Procedure 2021 regarding library media collections, emphasizing the need for a formal process for regular collection assessment due to past neglect from budget cuts. Learning & Teaching Assistant Superintendent Heather Havens reported on a recent incident at Mt. Spokane High School where a book was removed following a parent's concern about its content, leading to a broader review of library materials. The district is now requiring that all library material purchases and donations be approved by Learning & Teaching, addressing parental rights and community engagement in the selection process. Additionally, the board deliberated on the revision of Policy 3141 concerning non-resident students, aiming to ensure equitable consideration for enrollment requests. This reflects an ongoing effort to refine policies and enhance transparency in decision-making processes within the district.
