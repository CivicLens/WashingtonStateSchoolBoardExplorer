To: Dr. Greg Baker, Superintendent
From: Tom Venable, Deputy Superintendent
Date: May 6, 2013
Re: Agreement with Sound Strategy Technology Group, LLC
During the fall of the 2012-13 school year, a new Educational Technology Planning Committee charter was developed and an
Educational Technology Planning Committee was formed, providing broad-based representation throughout the schools and
community. The emergence of the committee coincided with the expiration of the previous strategic plan in the area of
technology and the successful passage of a recent technology levy.
The Educational Technology Committee has been meeting every other week over the course of the past five months. During this
time, they have been deeply engaged in research, dialogue and deliberation in support of their efforts to develop a new strategic
plan and 2013-14 technology budget proposal. In support of their thinking, we have identified a variety of possible thoughtpartners locally and regionally to assist us in our development of a strategic plan and budget that supports the integration of
technology as part of the teaching and learning process for every student.
One key thought-partner that has emerged is Thuan Nguyen. Mr. Nguyen is an Assistant Superintendent in the Kent school
district. Recently recognized nationally as 100 Most Important People in Technology as part of Tech and Learnings 30th
anniversary, and identified by the National School Board Association as 20 People to Watch in the area of technology, weve
solicited his knowledge and expertise in support of our efforts to establish a strategic plan that improves teaching and learning
related to the outcomes described in The Bellingham Promise. A copy of an agreement between the Bellingham School District
and Sound Strategy Technology Group, L.L.C. has been attached for your review.
Thank you for your consideration of this agreement.
