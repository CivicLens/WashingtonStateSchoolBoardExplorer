Blaine Primary School: Principal Michelle McKeown and Assistant Principal Kelli Alonso reported. The use of social emotional learning structures has been helpful in getting students and teachers back on track after the pandemic. The Heggerty curriculum is being implemented to supplement the Fountas & Pinnell literacy curriculum. By next year, the goal is for all teachers to switch from DOLCH words to Fountas & Pinnell high-frequency words. Kindergartners have already exceeded the year-end goal for meeting grade-level standard in literacy, and they are close to the goal for math as well. Director Gibson asked about measurements at 3rd grade and Ms. McKeown described how the primary and elementary schools work closely together.
Blaine Elementary School: Principal Jordan Radke reported. He distributed and reviewed a laminated sheet of school goals and areas of focus. A successful method of math intervention at the 3rd grade level was credited for noticeable student growth. The BAS assessment for reading showed steady growth across all grades. Examples were provided for increasing positive culture for staff as well as students. Director Creydt asked how many more math interventionists would be needed to achieve the school's 90% goal. Mr. Radke commented on the need to utilize resources that are already in place, but would always welcome more help. Director Leu commented on the positive student growth for 3rd and 5th grade in math and asked about the differentiation with 4th grade which seems to be static. Mr. Radke described efforts to focus on the key learnings that students need to master. President Thomas asked if review of individual classroom strengths are being considered in identifying ways to improve. Mr. Radke affirmed that the collaborative work with teachers includes building a willingness to be vulnerable and utilize each others' strengths. Discussion continued regarding the 4th grade cohort's prior year's performance. Director Gibson asked what can be done for kids who are behind and discussion continued. Director Creydt asked if more volunteers are helping with interventions and Mr. Radke indicated it is similar to what he saw in other districts prior to the pandemic. The elementary school is welcoming many new volunteers whose help allows teachers to focus on students with more critical needs. Dr. Granger commended Mr. Radke for stepping into a difficult situation and working on school improvements.
Blaine Middle School: Principal Darren Benson and Assistant Principal Wayne Vezzetti reported. The reading levels represented in the STAR Reading assessments data were described, as well as the importance of including both writing and reading as new curriculum is implemented. The struggle of middle school culture was described as well as efforts to improve connections. Staff enjoyed their own brain break with laughter and smiles during the January 30 work day. President Thomas asked about the Sunshine Committee and Mr. Vezzetti described how it works.
Blaine High School: Principal Scott Ellis and Assistant Principal Beth Eide reported. There was review of curriculum and PLC work. Professional development in social emotional learning included a recent guest facilitator brought in to help staff better understand the needs of LGBTQ+ students. Data monitoring and SEL goals were reviewed. Mr. Ellis shared the example of a student who benefited from the CTE pathway to graduation which was recently approved by the board. Director Gibson asked how SEL statistics were gathered, and Ms. Eide explained how a survey was conducted during BUILD class. Director Leu asked what strategies are being used to address the 7% who don't have connection to an adult at the high school. Mr. Ellis shared information about the 9th Grade Success group as one example. Ms. Eide explained that, at this point, they don't have names associated with those students. President Thomas asked about student cell phone use during school and discussion continued. Dr. Granger commented on the graduation credit waiver, and Mr. Ellis added that the waiver contributed to the increased graduation rate.
