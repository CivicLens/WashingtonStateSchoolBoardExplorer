Transitional Bilingual Instructional Education Program
Molly Mitchell, Director of Human Resources, shared a presentation with the board
about the Transitional Bilingual Instructional Program. It was explained that funds are
provided by the state to ensure educational opportunities for students whose primary
language is something other than English. The Lynden SD uses those funds to
supplement the education program to assist students in attaining English proficiency and
meet the State’s academic learning standards. Resources are used for program staffing,
supplemental instructional materials, and professional development. The presentation
also included projected estimates of qualifying students in each building and estimated
grant allocation for the 23/24 school year.
c. Finance and Operations

A report was provided to the board, as required by Policy 6801, identifying equipment

and/or dispose of any capital assets during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023.
Policy 6500- Risk Management
A report was provided to the board, as required by Policy 6500, regarding the status of
the risk management program. It was noted that the district maintains comprehensive
property & liability coverage via the Washington School Risk Management Pool

5. Information from the Audience
- A community member addressed the board about the bond and his concerns with the impact on
financially struggling households.
- A community member spoke as a representative of the Northwest Carpenters Union workers in
support of the bond and noted that construction costs will only go up. He further stated that in
comparison to the recently built Ferndale High School, the estimated cost to build a new Lynden
High School seems reasonable.

A community member discussed his property tax statements and what bonds are already being
assessed. Even though he supports the program, he is concerned that there has been no
communication about the bond and why it is needed.
A community member spoke as a representative of the Northwest Laborers Union 292 in support
of the bond.
A community member addressed the board about some information she has learned about
students withdrawing from public schools in large numbers and the same-gender physical sexual
relationship that stemmed from it. She asked whether there is a cat litter box in the bathroom at
the high school. She asked how many 3rd graders cannot read. She asked about how many
students are doing drugs at school. She would like to know if there is a dress code and whether
pride-themed clothes are allowed. She also expressed that she doesn’t agree with the spending
of monies to hire a person to guide the board on funding initiatives.
A community member said that he is glad that there is now a long term facilities plan in place so
that we will know when we need to ask for another bond and it won’t be a surprise in the future.
He added that it will only get more expensive if we wait to build a new high school.
A community member indicated he thought that a school being 40 years old is not a good reason
to replace it and that if we do replace a school we need to be thinking about longevity.
A community member expressed that building a new school and being taxed on assessed value
of his property seems like a lot of money since he bought his house many years ago for a much
lower cost. He also expressed his concerns with the unknowns like where will the high school go
and what are we going to do with the students?
A member of the bond planning task force explained that the recommendation provided to the
board was a well-thought decision and that there are numerous reasons why we need to rebuild
the high school. He also expressed the many benefits to the community such as giving our kids an
education they deserve so they can improve their lives and the community in the future. He
encouraged the board to focus on the value.
A bond planning task force member and parent expressed that he is concerned about his current
high schooler and her emotional well-being given the lack of space for her and her friends to
connect and feel safe on campus. He is also an educator and expressed the benefits of expanding
the opportunities for career and technical education classes, specifically for kids that may be
struggling academically. This would give them a place to belong and thrive.
