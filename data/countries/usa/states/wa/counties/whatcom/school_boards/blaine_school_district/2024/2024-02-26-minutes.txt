  3. Public Comment
A. Public Comment
The following individuals addressed the board regarding topics of concern:
David Spring shared his advocacy for local control of public schools, emphasizing his campaign for state superintendent aimed at restoring control to local communities. He highlighted his commitment to refrain, as the superintendent, from threatening to withhold public funds from schools who exercise their constitutional right to local control. He also drew comparisons to Sweden's experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Charles Gibson provided an update on the Peace Arch Education Foundation. He noted the foundation's attainment of 501(c)(3) status, and outlined upcoming initiatives which include seeking corporate donations, establishing a website, and conducting listening sessions with the community to gather input on desired supports. The foundation's focus is on bolstering the financial resources of Blaine schools, with a commitment to supporting rather than supplanting existing resources. Mr. Gibson clarified that the foundation operates independently of the school board but collaborates with schools on tasks they lack funding for, aiming for broad community representation to inform their initiatives.
Mindi Caldwell, representing the Whatcom NAMI Affiliate, addressed the board and highlighted the organization's efforts to educate the community about mental health issues through programs like "Ending the Silence." She mentioned a recent grant aimed at increasing access to presentations for school districts, which are offered free of charge to students, parents, and youth caregivers. She invited further inquiries and offered assistance with scheduling presentations or providing additional information.
4. Reports
A. School Administrator Monthly Reports
Written reports from each school administrator were attached to the meeting agenda for board review and to supplement the verbal reports provided during the work session prior to this meeting.

A report showing revenue and expenses through the month of January was provided by the district's business office and attached to the meeting agenda for board review.
  Director Creydt brought up some inquiries regarding the report, expressing a desire for clarification. Dr. Granger mentioned that not having received these questions beforehand might pose a challenge in providing immediate responses.
  Director Creydt inquired about a discrepancy regarding the percentage of payroll in the budget. Her notes from a presentation by Amber Porter differ from a comment made by Dr. Granger at the February 20 meeting. Dr. Granger clarified that the figure of 88.5% referred to the previous, completed fiscal year. The 82% figure noted by Director Creydt would require further investigation to determine if the difference is because of different factors in the calculation.
  Director Creydt asked about the specific personnel responsible for compiling the enrollment and financial reports provided this month. Dr. Granger explained that various specialists in the Business Office handled the financial reports, while the enrollment report was overseen by the Student Data Director.
  Director Creydt raised concerns about Amber Porter's attendance and availability, expressing a desire for clarity on budget matters before any significant decisions are made. Dr. Granger encouraged Director Creydt to forward her questions to him for responses.
  Director Creydt inquired about the progress in finding a replacement for Amber Porter. Dr. Granger mentioned the absence of new applicants and the potential consideration of hiring a search firm.
  Director Creydt sought details on Amber Porter's work hours and communication availability, expressing disagreement with her compensation. Directors Freeman and Lazarus expressed support for Ms. Porter's continued contributions and they disagreed with requiring her presence at board meetings. Director Creydt maintained her stance in disagreement with Amber Porter's compensation.
  D. Legislative Report
The board's Legislative Representative, Erika Creydt, provided an update on the 2024 legislative session. She mentioned that other districts have shown support for school-related issues through letters. Director Creydt also discussed her meeting with House Representative Alicia Rule, focusing on bills that could impact Blaine schools the most.
  Director Creydt asked if a list had been made accessible on the website showing critical bills related to schools. Dr. Granger indicated that the information is available in the superintendent's section of the website.
  Director Freeman raised concerns about state mandates controlling local school curriculum. He mentioned instances where non-compliance was met with threats from the state to withhold funding. He shared insights from a Kennewick School District board director he met at the WSSDA Conference, highlighting the challenges faced by that district's governing board during the COVID crisis.
  Director Lazarus sought clarification on the implications of HB 2331. He echoed concerns about the state mandating curriculum and adding to unfunded mandates.
  Director Creydt emphasized the evolving nature of bills and the importance of staying updated. The discussion highlighted the complexities of navigating legislative mandates and the need for continued vigilance and advocacy to protect local autonomy and educational integrity.
  E. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Bond/Levy: Dr. Granger thanked the community for their support in the successful passage of the levy. He also noted the support for the bond and proposed the formation of a committee to reintroduce it on the November ballot.
Growth Management: The district is cooperating with the City of Blaine and Whatcom County growth management work currently underway. The resulting documents will be presented to the board in December.
Board Vacancies: Communication has been drafted to announce the board vacancies in Districts 4 and 5. March 15 was proposed for a special board meeting to conduct interviews with interested candidates.
Artificial Intelligence (AI): Efforts are underway to secure support for teachers and students involved in AI-related work.

Chief Financial Officer (CFO): A qualified candidate was interviewed earlier this month, but took another position later that same day. The district may engage a recruiting service to widen the search beyond the statewide postings already in place. This will incur an expense of approximately $10K.

Amendments to state budget proposals have included many initiatives, including a change to High School and Beyond Plans.
The Mix Factor bill has not made significant progress.
The MSOC bill provides some increased funding, but falls short of filling in the gap.
