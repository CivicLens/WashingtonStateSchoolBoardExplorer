REPORTS
Asset Preservation Program
Mike Anderson, manager of Buildings and Grounds, reported on the Asset Preservation Program
in accordance with Policy 6800 and state regulations. A requirement of Asset Preservation
Program is that an initial building condition evaluation for affected buildings be conducted and
reported to the Board prior to April 1, 2011. Mr. Anderson reported that the Asset Preservation
Program is a systematic approach to ensure performance accountability; promote student health
and safety by maintaining and operating building systems to their design capacity; maintain an
encouraging learning environment; and extend building life in order to minimize future capital
needs. Based on the evaluations, District buildings are in good condition and received good
scores. The Board expressed appreciation to Mr. Anderson and the Buildings and Grounds staff
for an excellent job maintaining the District buildings.
Student Achievement (I-728) Report
Karst Brandsma gave a status report on student achievement funds (I-728). By state statue,
districts can use I-728 funds for specific purposes, including class size reduction, extended
learning opportunities, professional development, pre-kindergarten activities, and facility
improvements related to class size reductions or extended learning opportunities. As a result of
these identified priorities, and the fact that the Legislature eliminated all new funding for I-728 in
2010–2011, it was recommended that I-728 carryover funds for 2011–2012 be used for full-time
kindergarten (extended learning); summer school activities (extended learning); and indirect cost
activities at a maximum of 5%. At the end of 2011–2012 school year, it is anticipated that all I728 funds will be depleted.
Public Hearing on I-728 Budget
¾ President Ann Whitmyer opened the public hearing portion of the meeting as required by
law. There were no public comments and President Whitmyer closed the public hearing portion
of the meeting.
Use of I-728 funds will be included in the 2011–12 Bellingham School District budget when it is
presented to the Board at a later meeting.
