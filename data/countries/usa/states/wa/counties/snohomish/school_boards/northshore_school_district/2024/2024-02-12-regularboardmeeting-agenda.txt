Summary:
The Northshore School District Board of Directors has set aside a period of up to 60 minutes to receive updates and comments
fromDistrictassociation leaders and community members.As referenced in multiple policies adopted by The Board, we expect all parties
addressing the Board to present their comments in a way that is civil and respectful. This means that whether we are school directors,
district staff, students, members of the community, or some other guest, we must all follow the same standard of civility during school board
meetings. Please speak directly to the Board and address matters related to district operations, policies, procedures, and agenda items
under consideration by the Board.
Washington State law requires that the Board limit its business and discussionat the Board meetingto onlythoseitems that have been
captured in the previously published agenda. What that means for us today:
Any public comment regarding itemsthat are includedin the published agenda will be taken into consideration by the Board when the
topic is addressed during the agenda.
Any topics brought up during public comment that are notincludedin the published agenda cannot, by law, be discussed at this
meeting and so will not be addressed or receive a response during the meeting.
In either case, depending on the nature ofyourtopic or questions,a district employee or a board member will follow up onany comments that
relate to district business.Please note that the boards silence during public comment is neutral. It is neither a signal of agreement nor
disagreement with the speakers remarks.
Also please note that comments should not make referenceto any employee or representative of the Districtby name or by identifiable
reference.If you are interested in makingcomments or complaints regardingan individual, you may use thecomplaint process available
through the Office of the Superintendent.
Finally, please remember that your words have impact and you, not the school district, are responsible for your words. We caution all
speakers that it is possible that your statements could violate the rights of others under various laws, including laws protecting privacy and
laws prohibiting defamation. If you are unsure of the legal effect of your remarks, you should seek independent legal advice. In any case, we
ask that you help us model for our students what a respectful and inclusive community looks and sounds like.

Summary:
TheUSRowing Youth National Championships is the culmination of a year's hard work, planning, and
training for student athletes. Athletes have had to learn teamwork, planning, fund raising, managing their
time and finances, and help with the preparation to attend this event. Crew is a pure team sport. There
are no superstars in a boat. All rowers must work together in order to succeed. This also translates to
outside of the racing environment. The championships themselves is the coming together of the regional
winners to compete for a national race.

(PDB) Contract for the Elementary Expansion Projects. No
signature is required at this time.

Public Content
Summary:
Capital Projects, in collaboration with our Progressive Design Build (PDB) partner Abbott Construction, has strategically chosen to enact
preemptive measures to counteract potential increases in equipment costs resulting from inflation in construction materials and persistent
supply chain challenges. To facilitate this initiative, we are proactively securing required electrical equipment (gear, switchboards,
panelboards, etc.), HVAC air handlers, and site storm detention and treatment equipment/structures in advance. This strategy aims to assist
in our ability to adhere to the current budget and schedule for the Elementary Expansion Projects at Crystal Springs, Fernwood, and Woodin
elementaries and Sorenson Early Childhood Center, and will involve the signing of Amendment #2. We anticipate that one additional
Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment will be executed in order to establish the overall Guaranteed Maximum Price for the project.
Amendment #2 will specifically authorize the involvement of competitively selected mechanical, electrical and sitework sub-contractors and
allow procurement of equipment and structures.
