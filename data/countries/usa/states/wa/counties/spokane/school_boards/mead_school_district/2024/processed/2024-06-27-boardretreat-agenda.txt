Board Communication Structures & Protocols (Policy 1220)
• Internal (staff)
• External (parents/patrons/media)
• Communication Reminders
o Email reminders and scheduling correspondence do not violate
OPMA.
o A meeting doesn’t occur just by an email being sent to all board
members. Board members can passively receive information through
email. The key is that board members must not exchange preliminary
thoughts – if they discuss the information by sending emails back
and forth, that may constitute a meeting.
