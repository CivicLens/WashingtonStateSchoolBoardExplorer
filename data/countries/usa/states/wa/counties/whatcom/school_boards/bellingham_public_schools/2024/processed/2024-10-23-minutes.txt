Meeting Purpose – Explanation of Student Roundtable: Mr. Benjamin thanked
everyone for taking the time to be here this afternoon.
Student roundtables give the school board an opportunity to strengthen the connection
with our students, and the school board is excited to hear what students have to say about
their experiences. Five table groups each held conversations, using the following
questions as a guide:
•
•
•
•

What is your understanding of the cell phone policy at Bellingham High?
Is it different from last year/past years/middle school (depending on grade of
student)?
What have you noticed since the policy has been enforced?
Have there been positive impacts? Negative? Surprises?

How is the cell phone policy enforced with other types of technology, i.e. Apple
watches?
If you have a job or if you think about getting a job in the future, do you think
limited access to cell phones would impact you differently?
What do you think about the connection between phones and teens’ mental
health?
How would you describe the “addiction” aspect to cell phone use? Before vs.
now?
What has worked well with this change?
What would you do to improve this change?
Has this change impacted your relationships with other students? Staff? If so,
how?
Has the cell phone change affected anything else during class, i.e. expectations
about the use of other types of technology, i.e. laptops?
What is the talk at home? How do your parents/guardians feel about the
enforcement of the cell phone policy?

At the end of the small group time, Dr. Baker asked each group to share briefly what they
had discussed. The following are highlights from each group:
First table:
• Students feel a difference in the cell phone use policy from last year to this year,
as well as from middle school to high school.
• The policy has been implemented well, and there doesn’t appear to be a lot of
tension around the policy.
• Students have witnessed other students needing to take their cell phone to the
office after they’ve violated the policy.
• Students talk to each other more when they aren’t using their cell phones.
• Students would like to be allowed to listen to music using their phones during
individual work time and advisory.
Second table:
• This group is generally accepting of the policy.
• It’s difficult to not have access to our music, especially when there are a lot of
distractions in the room during individual work time. Music helps students to
focus while doing individual work.
• Not all parents understand the policy and have continued to text and call their
students during the school day.
• It can be difficult for some parents to get to the school to retrieve a student’s
confiscated phone, due to having a different work schedule or working out of
town.
• Overall, students give the cell phone policy a 7.5 or 8 out of 10.
• Students engage with other students when phones are used less often.

Third table:
• Students had more choice in how much to use their phones last year, where this
year it is more of an expectation that they will use their phones less while at
school.
• The students don’t have access to their music without their phones.
• There needs to be more clarity with families about the policy, as it doesn’t seem
that families know what the rules are.
• The policy at high school feels less restrictive than middle school.
• Is it possible that parents could text school office staff when they need to get a
message to their student, rather than having to make a phone call?
Fourth table:
• Ninth graders believe the cell phone policy in middle school is similar to this
year’s policy at high school, while upperclassmen have noticed more of a policy
change from last year to this year.
• Students wish they could have a little more flexibility with their phones around
the start and end of class.
• Sometimes the policy seems to be used as a “gotcha” instead of allowing a little
grace, especially at the beginning or end of class.
• Listening to individual music can be helpful during work time, so students would
like more flexibility when it comes to using their phones for music.
• Overall, students feel they can self-regulate their phone use and don’t feel they are
addicted to their phones.
• Many students received their first cell phone at age 10 or 11.
• Positive changes this year include more conversation among students, more class
participation and students focusing more on the teacher.
• The policy can be too strict for some students and enforcement should be on an
individualized basis.
• Students want to be treated with respect regarding cell phone use.
Fifth table:
• In comparison to previous years, the cell phone rules are stricter.
• Having parents pick up a confiscated cell phone can be problematic.
• Students are finding sneaky ways to use cell phones, such as obtaining a Smart
Pass for the restroom and checking their phone instead of using the restroom.
• Having consistent cell phone rules helps students focus more on schoolwork.
• It’s a risk to have your phone out when you know you could lose it.
• The goal for having the Smart Pass system is not achieved when students abuse it.
• When you’re on your phone too much in school, it makes it hard to remember
what you learned in your classes.
• Parents should wait as long as possible to get their child a cell phone, perhaps
until they are 12 or 13, when kids are more mature.
• Parents should establish screentime limits for young students.
