OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
August 19, 2020 – via remote Zoom meeting.
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Mr. Benjamin called the meeting to order at 6:03 p.m. He acknowledged that this
meeting, while attended from various locations, is being held on the ancestral homelands
of the Coastal Salish people. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin
(President), Camille Diaz Hackler, Jenn Mason, Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker
and Sheri O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
Mr. Benjamin noted that, because of our current emergency status due to COVID-19,
public participation is limited to written submissions only, and any written comments
received will be shared with the school board directors. Each board member has seen all
messages received. He noted that the board has received and appreciates the large amount
of feedback regarding police presence in schools. He noted that Dr. Baker and district
staff are continuing to investigate next steps.
Mr. Benjamin acknowledged that Assistant Superintendent of Teaching and Learning
Steve Clarke is retiring, and this will be the last board meeting he will be attending.
Board members shared their reflections on Mr. Clarke’s time in the district and expressed
their gratitude for all he has done to benefit the school community.

Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Dr. Baker confirmed that Mr. Clarke has been an outstanding person to work with and
expressed best wishes in retirement for he and his family.
• The COVID-19 pandemic continues to take much time and effort on behalf of staff.
The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) has asked each district
in the state to take a formal resolution regarding reopening plans to its school board,
as evidence that the board has approved of the district’s reopening plan. More will be
shared about the reopening plan this evening.
• As expected, local, state, national and worldwide budgets are being impacted by the
pandemic. Districts across the state are not transporting students to school, and the
state will discontinue funding for transportation. We are currently in a strong
financial position. District revenue is based on student enrollment, and as families

make other choices for their children for 2020-21, the district’s apportionment will
decrease, which will force us to make some decisions regarding expenditures.
The first day of school was moved from Sept. 2 to Sept. 8, to allow staff to use some
professional development days (also referred to as “purple days”), which had been
slated for later in the year, to help staff prepare for remove learning. The district is
still required to provide 180 days of school, averaging six hours per day.
Ensuring that all families have Wi-Fi is extremely important. PreK-1 students will be
provided with iPads, while students in grades 2-12 will be provided laptops. We are
working to provide school supplies for families and are open to families borrowing
desks and chairs if they are needed.
One of the biggest challenges in our community prior to the pandemic was access to
child care, and it continues to be a challenge. We are working with child care
providers to support families.
Families have let us know that they want more structured, synchronous (live)
learning. The entire school day will not be synchronous, but there will be more live
learning via video-conferencing tools this fall than there was last spring. Knowing
that it can be challenging for families to structure their day based on the school day,
we are trying to create as much flexibility as possible. Bellingham Virtual Learning
(BVL) will be a good option for some families. BVL will make use of Accelerate and
Edgenuity programs so students are able to take their classes online in an
asynchronous manner, with students continuing to stay connected to their
neighborhood schools. The Bellingham Family Partnership Program (BFPP) is also
available to serve families.
A “virtual conversation” webinar is scheduled for tomorrow, which will help to
communicate current plans to the community and answer some questions that
families have been asking.
Most of our employees are not contracted to work during the summer, but many have
volunteered their time to serve on committees, helping to envision what the beginning
of the school year will look like. Dr. Baker introduced Executive Director of
Teaching and Learning Kristi Dominguez and Executive Director of Operations
Jessica Sankey, co-chairs of the Reopening Schools Advisory Committee, who
reviewed the work of that committee thus far. Board members asked questions and
expressed appreciation to staff members for their dedicated work over the past several
months.
