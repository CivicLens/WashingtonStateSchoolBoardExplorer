

What resonates in The Bellingham Promise?

Promise?
What are some of your reflections about the strengths/uniqueness of IB?
How could Bellingham Public Schools strengthen/develop the IB program?

During the meeting, attendees shared insights and thoughts on the guiding questions. Highlights
of comments:
o Phrases such as all children should be loved and the whole child is important resonated
with many.
o Attendees expressed appreciation for the ways in which the district supports its students
and observed that teachers demonstrate that they care for all students and families.
o It is evident that different learning aptitudes and styles are embraced. A lot of differences
in learning styles are built into the IB curriculum.
o Harder and more differentiated world language classes would be welcomed.
o IB allows students to learn to become problem solvers. Inquiry-based classrooms are
emphasized from kindergarten on.
o IB fosters many good community connections.
o IB teachers do a good job modeling risk taking and they are open to being lifelong
learners.
o It would be great if IB could be offered to every student, or at the very least, continue
through the middle school years.
o IB supports “messy learning,” an approach that is perhaps easier in elementary rather
than middle school.
Meeting minutes are attached.

Large Group Discussion with School Board: For discussion purposes, attendees
divided into two groups. Dr. Copland facilitated one group; Rob McElroy facilitated the
others. Following is a summary of responses to the guiding questions:


What resonates in The Bellingham Promise:
o All children should be loved.
o The whole child is important.
o All children will be exceptional in their own way.
o The commitment to global thinkers.
o Every child can learn at high levels.



What is missing?
o {Parent response}: The document is easy to read and follow. I tried to find
problems within it, but I couldn’t.
o {Parent response}: I wonder if [the outcomes] can be pulled off in all
schools, given the different structures in schools?



How do you see your experiences in IB connected to the outcomes of The
Bellingham Promise?
o {Student response}: It is cool how our schools are focused on creating a
person that will be helpful, and how we will achieve a lot when we work
together to help in the community.
o {Parent response}: I love this school system because of the support the
students receive. The teachers care for students and families, even those
for whom English is not the primary language.
o {Parent response}: There is the whole child emphasis, and different
learning aptitudes and styles are embraced. A lot of differences in learning
styles are built into the curriculum.
What are some of your reflections about the strengths/uniqueness of IB?
o {Student response}: We are learning to be problem solvers, to apply what
we learned to specific problems, and not to just spit out information.
o {Parent response}: Assignments involve research, rather than just hearing
lectures from the classroom teacher.
o {Parent response}: From kindergarten on, our children were in globally
focused, inquiry-based classrooms. These approaches were not just
inferred; they came through clearly.
o {Parent response}: The concept of thinking through inquiry, and helping
our kids to grow – all of our children experienced that. I love those
concepts, and the fact they are imbedded in the curriculum.
o {Staff response}: The cumulative project in fifth grade ended up reflecting
positively on the school and on the many different elements of IB. Kids
are tackling issues such as domestic violence, homelessness, animal abuse.
They feel empowered to take action by raising funds or raising awareness.
o {Parent response}: The program fosters many good community
connections.

o {Parent and student responses}: World language offerings are very much
appreciated.
o {Parent response}: All the kids [in our family] have had phenomenal
experiences, but there has been a consistency, even when they had
different teachers. BPS has great teachers all around. There has not been
one case where we have said, ‘we can’t wait til next year.’
o {Student response}: My IB experience helped me become more confident.
It has helped my classmates become less shy and better able to express
themselves.
o {Parent response}: IB supports flexibility and “messy learning.” This
approach is perhaps easier in elementary schools than in middle schools.
o {Parent response}: In IB schools, teachers “jump in.” They model risktaking. Teachers seem more open, as well, to be learners.
o {Parent response}: Students are encouraged to be leaders, collaborators
and team players. Kids are leading the learning. Kids follow their passions
and “own” their learning.
o {Parent response}: IB focuses on students’ passion and interests versus
forced learning; it focuses on fun versus boring classroom environments.


How could Bellingham Public Schools strengthen/develop the IB program?
o {Student response}: Harder, more differentiated Spanish classes.
o {Student response}: It was fun to learn Mandarin. It brought me a
different world that I didn’t know about. But it could have been harder and
it ended in the fifth grade. It would have been cool if we could have
continued.
o {Student response}: Longer classes.
o {Student response}: I have been challenged {now that I am in middle
school} but in a different way. It would have been great to continue what
we had been doing in the IB program.
o {Parent response}: It would be good to see the IB through-lines continue
in middle school; for example, focus on character development and more
inquiry-based learning. The middle school experience is more segmented;
there is less of a trans-disciplinary approach. (However, there is a shift
noted in math with the Agile Mind curriculum, which seems to align with
the inquiry-based approach.)
o {Staff response}: Although our IB students have had different teachers,
there has been consistency. Our district has supported common planning
times and opportunities to collaborate. I hope that continues and grows.
o {Student response}: Bring more world language to the IB schools.
o {Staff response}: I believe IB can benefit every student but maybe not
every teacher.
o {Parent response}: Bring the program throughout the district, for every
student.
o {Parent response}: How much do parents know about what IB means?
There is room for improvement here.

talking points.
