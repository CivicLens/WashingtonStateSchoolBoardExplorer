  5. Action Items
A. Resolution 2425-01 WIAA Fair, Safe, and Nondiscriminatory Practice in Athletic and Extracurricular Activities
Director Credyt asked about getting questions answered by the district's attorney, and President Freeman summarized the attorney's comments that were emailed to the directors prior to the meeting. Those comments described problems that could result from using stronger language in the resolution. Director Swinburnson indicated he would approve this resolution and he would also be in favor of using the stronger language, similar to Kennewick and Colville school districts. President Freeman added that this resolution provides a path forward by directing the superintendent to take action. Director Lazarus asked Dr. Granger if the direction was understood and if he is content with it. Dr. Granger affirmed and described his conversations on this topic with other superintendents around the state. Director Creydt asked if this would impact the district's competitions with other schools. Dr. Granger answered no, and explained the process which would eventually require a vote of the WIAA board.
  The board voted unanimously to adopt the proposed Resolution 2425-01 WIAA Fair, Safe, and Nondiscriminatory Practice in Athletic and Extracurricular Activities
Motion by Ben Lazarus, second by Steve Galbraith
Final Resolution: Motion Carries 5-0
Yea: Erika Creydt, Ben Lazarus, Cliff Freeman, Ryan Swinburnson, Steve Galbraith
  B. Policy 5251 Conflicts of Interest: First Reading
President Freeman began the discussion by supporting the current policy, noting that the issue had already been addressed by previous board directors. He preferred focusing energy on offering summer school instead. Director Lazarus agreed, emphasizing his stance as a teacher and stating he would never tutor his own students for an extra fee. He suggested an exception might be feasible for part-time or substitute teachers, although that wasn’t a policy language option being considered at this meeting.

Director Swinburnson agreed that teachers should not tutor their own students, but highlighted that the board was originally discussing allowing teachers to tutor other students. He disagreed with the limitation that prevents Blaine teachers from tutoring Blaine students, advocating for policy language that permits this. While he didn’t have specific language to propose, Director Swinburnson wanted the policy language to remain under consideration. He added that if summer school couldn't be offered, an alternative for students needing extra help should be provided.

Discussion continued regarding Director Galbraith’s proposed policy language. Director Creydt brought up the importance of aligning any policy with the school’s mission statement. She would support either the WSSDA or Galbraith options, and expressed a preference for WSSDA’s language. Director Galbraith stood by his proposed language, suggesting it could be adjusted based on feedback from the attorney. He supported allowing tutoring under certain circumstances, such as restricting teachers to tutoring students in grades higher than what they teach. He opposed the WSSDA language, as it would require administrators to decide who can or cannot tutor which he felt was inappropriate.

Director Lazarus shared his personal experience tutoring a student from another class without charging an extra fee and reiterated his preference for summer school as a more equitable option for all students, regardless of their ability to pay for private tutoring.

President Freeman summarized the discussion and asked for a motion, expressing a desire to move forward and not prolong the debate month after month. Dr. Granger requested direction from the board on how to handle a current situation involving a student who had been tutored last summer by their current teacher. Director Swinburnson asked how the current policy had been enforced over the summer and a discussion followed about potential disciplinary measures for violating the policy. Director Galbraith questioned why no discipline had been enacted, and discussion followed. Director Lazarus confirmed that there was an understanding that enforcement of the current policy would be paused while the board was reviewing the issue. Director Galbraith stated that he was unaware that a teacher was tutoring over summer break.

Director Creydt reminded the board that its role was to set policy, not enforce it, and emphasized the importance of setting a policy that supports students needing extra help, particularly in reading. Dr. Granger asked the board to give consideration in the next month to how this new policy language would be enforced. Director Swinburnson clarified that his previous comments regarding the board’s continuing discussion on this topic were not meant to imply the current policy shouldn't be enforced. Director Creydt noted that the adoption date on the draft policy was “TBD”. Director Swinburnson concluded that enforcement of the updated policy should follow the same protocol as with the current policy.
  The board voted to approve "First Reading" of changes to Policy 5251 Conflicts of Interest, using language provided by Director Galbraith at the August meeting.
Motion by Erika Creydt, second by Ryan Swinburnson
Final Resolution: Motion Carries 3-2
Yea: Erika Creydt, Ryan Swinburnson, Steve Galbraith
Nay: Ben Lazarus, Cliff Freeman
  Director Galbraith repeated his prior request that attorney communication be forwarded to the board in its entirety and not cut and pasted into an email from the superintendent. Dr. Granger explained that correspondence with the district's attorney frequently contains content regarding multiple issues for efficiency. He indicated that there would be a cost to separating topics of communication with the attorney in order to fulfill this request. Director Galbraith affirmed his desire for the full email to be forwarded to the board instead of the comments being cut and pasted into an email from Dr. Granger.
  C. Policy 3241 Student Discipline: First Reading
The board approved "First Reading" of changes to Policy 3241 Student Discipline. WSSDA recommended updates to this policy in response to emergency rules enacted by OSPI in August of 2024. Dr. Granger explained that these updates will be in place until permanent rules are enacted by the legislature. Director Swinburnson commented on how these new rules further limit the school's ability to respond to student behavior. He will support the policy update despite disagreeing with the substance of OSPI's rule changes.

After Director Galbraith made a motion for approval, discussion continued regarding the consequences of not adopting this new language. Director Swinburnson seconded the motion, expressing reluctance.
  The board voted unanimously to approve "First Reading" of changes to Policy 3241 Student Discipline.

  6. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)
A. Discussion and General Comments
Director Swinburnson acknowledged the recent passing of John and Carole Liebert, noting their significant contributions to the Blaine School District. Director Creydt echoed his sentiments, calling them special people, and President Freeman also expressed his agreement.
  Contract Execution: Dr. Granger asked the board to confirm whether all contracts be signed only after board approval. He noted that, if so, this protocol would need to be communicated to staff for clarity. Director Swinburnson, drawing from his understanding of general contract law, questioned the purpose of board approval if contracts are signed before that approval is granted. He clarified that he did not have any concerns about the current contracts or about the district's current leadership. Director Swinburnson explained that his concern was about setting a precedent that could lead to issues in the future. He emphasized the importance of seeking legal advice on the matter, stating that if a contract does not require board approval, it can be signed without it, but if approval is required, the contract should only be signed afterward.

An example scenario was discussed, and Dr. Granger explained the potential impact of delaying the signing of contracts until after board approval which could slow down the process. Director Swinburnson pointed out that the contract discussed at the previous month's meeting, which sparked this conversation, was not an emergency. Director Lazarus then asked if there were any objections to continuing current practices until legal feedback is received. Director Swinburnson agreed, clarifying that operations should continue as usual until any official changes are made, and discussing the issue should not alter existing procedures.

Director Creydt requested an update on the General Assembly, and President Freeman explained the process by which WSSDA advocates to legislators. Having learned about WSSDA's advocacy process, President Freeman expressed a desire for input from the board to inform his representation of Blaine School District. He emphasized his desire to ensure that the district participates in WSSDA's legislative advocacy process next year.
  Enrollment Committee: At Director Swinburnson's request, the board revisited his proposal to form an enrollment committee. Director Swinburnson noted the strong social media response after the board's August meeting and requested further discussion to gauge the full board's interest in moving forward with the idea. He reiterated the importance of seeking input from a broader group of stakeholders beyond the usual committee participants and expressed a willingness to pursue the initiative only if the board agrees.

Dr. Granger asked for clarification regarding the student withdrawal data presented by Director Swinburnson at the August meeting, and he noted that Blaine’s withdrawal rate falls in line with the county average. Director Creydt supported the idea of engaging parents to understand why some families are leaving Blaine schools, while President Freeman expressed skepticism, citing the complexity of gathering meaningful feedback due to the many variables at play. Director Creydt countered by suggesting that, without this effort, the district might miss opportunities to retain students. Director Galbraith agreed that getting fresh perspectives is valuable, but voiced concerns—based on a WSSDA training—about having a board member on the committee, as it might create the perception that the board is committing to specific actions. While he supports the idea, Director Galbraith emphasized the importance of being mindful of the board's role.

Director Swinburnson shared that his motivation for joining the board was to improve Blaine schools, and he feels so strongly about the issue of enrollment that he would rather serve on the committee than on the board. He expressed concerns that having administration on the committee might hinder open feedback and participation, and he volunteered to take the lead. President Freeman suggested that Director Swinburnson draft a formal proposal for the board to review and vote on at the next meeting. Director Lazarus asked for clarity on the steps needed to move forward, and Director Swinburnson reiterated that he only sought the board’s consensus and support.

President Freeman also asked Dr. Granger about previous efforts to gather feedback from families. Dr. Granger explained that declining enrollment is a broader issue in Whatcom County, with growth expected in the general population but not in school-aged children. He shared that last year’s conversations with families who left for online programs led to the creation of Blaine’s new secondary online ALE program. Dr. Granger also highlighted the significance of the upcoming election and urged support for candidates who are committed to education funding. He expressed concern that while the legislature may address the urgent Transition to Kindergarten funding shortfall, the larger issue of school funding could continue to be ignored. Dr. Granger noted that rising costs are outpacing revenue, further complicating the district’s financial outlook.

Director Swinburnson clarified that his comments were not intended as a criticism of Blaine schools, but suggested that factors such as public school curriculum could be driving some families toward private schools. He proposed using this feedback to inform the district's advocacy efforts in Olympia and emphasized the need for board and parent backing to create meaningful change. Dr. Granger invited Director Swinburnson to join him in addressing the Blaine City Council on the topic of affordable housing, which Director Swinburnson agreed to do. Director Swinburnson will prepare a proposal for the next board meeting. Dr. Granger referred to the Committees policy, noting that it requires the board president to appoint participating board members.

Director Galbraith requested an update on the district’s secondary online program. Dr. Granger reported that 31 students are currently enrolled which is double the initial target, reflecting the program's success. Dr. Granger also expressed interest in expanding the program to include lower grade levels in the future.

Director Lazarus informed the board about the upcoming OSPI candidate debate on September 26 and encouraged all directors to tune in.
