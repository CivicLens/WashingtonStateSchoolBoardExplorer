Explanation of Issue:

In September 2020 the boardapproved Dawson Construction Inc. as the General Contractor Construction Manager (GCCM) for the new
Sunnyland Elementary School.Since that time Dawson has been involved in a variety of pre-construction activities including design
consultation, value engineering, constructability analysis, bid planning, estimating, schedule development, etc.
Dawson is now ready to begin the initial construction phase of the project.This work will include bidding and material procurement of
several critical subcontractor packages, preparation of the construction staging area (including early abatement and demo), portable
demo and relocation, erosion control measures including a storm water detention system and associated underground piping, and
negotiated support service required throughout construction (project supervision, site layout, construction trailer, refuse/garbage

collection and disposal, temporary heat/power, etc.). In order to commence with these activities the district must execute an amendment
to the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for the project which is currently $0.00.
The amendment specifies the scope of the work and a not-to-exceed price for performing the work.The final amount paid for the work
will be subject to itemized invoices for both time and materials but will not exceed the amendment amount.
As Dawson continues with additional construction work we may bring additional GMP amendments to the board for its consideration.The
cost process will culminate late this spring or early summer with the establishment of the final Guaranteed Maximum Price for the project.

Explanation of Issue:
In June 2010 the Board adopted Policy 6800 in order for the district to comply with state regulations pertaining to the Asset Preservation Program (APP).
We must comply with APP in order to be eligible for state construction assistance funding for future school modernization projects.
One of the specific requirements associated with APP is that on or before April 1 of each year, the Board will receive an annual report pertaining to the
condition of the districts facilities that were built after December 31, 1993, and for which the district received state construction funding assistance. The
affected facilities in our district are Birchwood and Happy Valley elementary schools, Kulshanand Shuksan middle schools,and Bellingham and Squalicum
high schools.
The attached document is the 2020 building assessment report prescribed by OSPI. The Condition Rating is a summary rating taking into consideration
the condition of all major systems at each school including foundations, walls, roofs, windows, doors, electrical, plumbing, heating, etc. All of these ratings
exceed the OSPI Building Condition Standards.
