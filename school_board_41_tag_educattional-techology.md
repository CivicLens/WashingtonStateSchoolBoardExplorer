## 2024-09-19 - BREMERTON_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Bremerton School District Board of Directors held their regular meeting on September 19, 2024, where they discussed various topics including significant policy changes. Assistant Superintendent Iva Scott presented Policy 3241 regarding Student Discipline, which aligns with OSPI’s emergency rules that introduced terms such as "discretionary discipline" and "nondiscretionary discipline," and removed the requirement for "other forms of discipline" before classroom exclusions. Concerns were raised regarding the impact of these changes on student behavior and academic performance. The board also approved the 2024-27 Bremerton Education Association Cooperative Working Agreement, which includes provisions for professional development and incentives for hiring and retaining special education and dual language teachers. 

Additionally, the board addressed community concerns about increased field rental prices, which could affect local clubs, and discussed the importance of ensuring that costs do not become a barrier for families. The meeting included updates on the Mind Over Mobile campaign aimed at reducing cell phone usage among students, which has reportedly had a positive academic impact. Interim Superintendent Donna Colosky also presented a Cyber Security update, emphasizing the need for a structured IT security framework and the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication to enhance school safety and reduce risks associated with technology use.
