  3. Reports
A. School Administrator Reports
Each school administrator reviewed their monthly report to the board.
Blaine Primary School: Assistant Principal Kelli Alonso reported on recent activities, including a visit from the Border Patrol to demonstrate community "Safekeepers", as well as a visit from the tooth fairy where each student received oral health materials. The school continues to uphold the ethos of "Each Student. Each Day." in equitable ways, and Classified Appreciation Week successfully highlighted the vital support provided by SEIU staff members. Additionally, Ms. Alonso announced that new student registration for 2024-2025 is now open for both kindergarten and the Transition to Kindergarten program.
Blaine Elementary School: Principal Jordan Radke provided updates, mentioning recent events such as the celebration of St. Patrick's Day with a visit from a playful leprechaun and professional development sessions addressing key questions concerning students' educational needs. The school also celebrated the contributions of Classified Staff. Mr. Radke announced upcoming events including a campus-wide pep assembly, family conferences, the Real Food Show, and the "Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader" competition at the high school.
Blaine Middle School: Principal Darren Benson shared recent activities at Blaine Middle School, highlighting a visit from Homeland Security to address online security concerns, as well as upcoming ELA professional development sessions for teachers. Mr. Benson described the school's two-week attendance competition, and he told how the March Madness tournaments are being used to help students learn about colleges.
Blaine High School: Interim Principal Beth Eide presented updates from Blaine High School, including the opportunity for over 50 students from the TSA, HOSA, and drama programs to participate in competitions at the state level after being sent off with a drum line and cheers from their peers. One student will also represent Blaine at the national chess competition in Washington D.C. Parents were able to attend a school-day assembly, for the first time since COVID, which was similar to the middle school's online safety presentation. A MTSS model is being used to focus on addressing the needs of 9th graders and on improving attendance. Ms. Eide described the support and encouragement she received from staff for her recent school accreditation meeting. Master schedule work for next year is also on the horizon. President Freeman asked for more detail about the assembly attended by parents and the state competition send-offs, and discussion followed.
  B. Enrollment Update
A report showing enrollment through the month of March was provided by the district's business office and attached to the meeting agenda for board review.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
A report showing revenue and expenses through the month of February was provided by the district's business office and attached to the meeting agenda for board review.
  D. Legislative Report
Director Creydt, the board's Legislative Representative, provided an update on the 2024 legislative session. She encouraged the other directors to check WSSDA's website for current bill information. She commented on a conversation she had with Representative Alicia Rule in the last hours of legislation about special funding that could be available for facility needs. Director Creydt shared comments on a bill that would allow 10th grade students to attend Running Start and on another bill establishing an AI Task Force. She encouraged other directors to look up bills and learn about them.

Director Creydt asked if bills are being updated in live time on the district's website, and Dr. Granger indicated that level of legislative detail is not being regularly updated on the school district website.

President Freeman shared concerns about SB5462 and HB2331 which have passed the legislature and are now pending the governor's signature. SB5462 mandates specific curriculum topics, including LGBTQ, and HB2331 allows OSPI to withhold funding for noncompliance with curriculum mandates. President Freeman expressed concern regarding the state's imposition on local control of school districts.

President Freeman further commented on Initiative 2081 Parents Bill of Rights which would affirm parents/guardians as primary stakeholders for children and allow them to access information about their children which is currently withheld once a child turns 13 years of age. President Freeman also commented on the possible need to consider changes in the district's Policy 3230 which prohibits parental access to certain student information for students 13 years of age or older.
  E. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Growth Management: Planning work is ongoing with the City of Blaine and Whatcom County.
Chief Financial Officer (CFO): The district's vacant CFO position is still being advertised. A contract with Northwest Leadership Associates is on this meeting's agenda which will result in expanding the search with a professional recruiter out to Idaho and Oregon.
Legislative Update: Dr. Granger shared slides that were presented at the recent Small Schools Leadership Conference highlighting statistics about the legislature's funding priorities. The information demonstrated ways that the state's spending on K-12 education has actually decreased in recent years. Dr. Granger encouraged the board and community to learn what priorities individual candidates support in this year's general election and take note of whether they prioritize K-12 education.
The final result of the MSOC bill provided a slight increase, covering only a fraction of what was requested for basic school costs like electricity and insurance.
The Special Education funding cap was also raised slightly, however this will minimally benefit Blaine because of corresponding increases in demand. Dr. Granger reiterated a preference for the cap to be eliminated and for the state to simply provide Special Education funding for all qualifying students. He affirmed that Special Education students are federally required to be served and the district does indeed serve all of them.
The next Supper with the Superintendent is scheduled on April 15.
Dr. Granger relayed a message from Charles Gibson who intends to return in April with another update from the education foundation.

D. Budget Reduction Considerations
Director Lazarus stated that this idea had come about at his suggestion, and he clarified that the rumors circulating about it were not reflective of his intent. He proposed pausing all raises across the board for everyone, emphasizing that many teachers he spoke with were willing to forgo raises to save jobs. He emphasized the importance of involving unions in the decision-making process regarding how the saved money would be allocated, believing it was crucial for them to take ownership of their role in the budget situation.
  Director Lazarus started to address Dean Berkeley's comments as well as an email he received previously from Mr. Berkeley, clarifying that the suggestion described above was not Dr. Granger's idea and there should be no claim of Dr. Granger bargaining with the union(s) in bad faith. Director Creydt called a point of order regarding the comment about bad faith bargaining, and discussion followed. President Freeman stressed the aim to mitigate staffing reduction, and he proposed revisiting this topic at a later time after both unions had been engaged to explore their willingness to consider this suggestion. Director Creydt inquired if legal advice had been sought from the district's attorney, to which Dr. Granger relayed from legal counsel that the contract(s) could be reopened and doing so would reopen all issues in the contract.
  Director Lazarus engaged in discussion with Shane Levetsovitis regarding concerns, voiced during Public Comments, related to classified staffing reductions.
  Director Swinburnson expressed apprehensions about possible unintended consequences from reopening agreements because of all issues being open to renegotiation. Those concerns were echoed by Directors Creydt and Galbraith.
  Discussion continued regarding the board's desire to hold a special meeting in the following week on this topic, and Dr. Granger explained the challenges posed by the timelines that are dictated by statutory and contractual obligations.
  The board agreed by consensus to table the suggestion from Director Lazarus to direct the superintendent to engage both the BEA and SEIU unions to explore reopening agreements.
Motion by Cliff Freeman, second by Ben Lazarus.
No further action was taken.
  Director Galbraith sought clarification regarding the letters going out in the coming week, and Dr. Granger explained that this round of letters would notify staff members whose positions may potentially be impacted.
  6. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)
A. Director Conduct Expectations (Policies 1400, 1620, 1825)
President Freeman initiated a discussion on board policies 1400, 1620, and 1825, underscoring the importance of director conduct in fostering effective governance. He encouraged new directors to engage with Dr. Granger regularly, participate in events like Supper with the Superintendent, and establish one-on-one meetings with each other.
  Director Lazarus shared comments regarding his observations of board dynamics prior becoming a director himself. He starting providing explanation regarding his comments at the February 26 meeting about Director Creydt's behavior towards former CFO Amber Porter. Director Creydt called a point of order, objecting to the accusations referenced at the February 26 meeting. Director Lazarus maintained that Director Creydt's conduct has repeatedly breached board policy, stating that her behavior seems to be aimed at making Dr. Granger and Ms. Porter look bad. Director Creydt maintained her objections. President Freeman interceded and the conversation ended.
  B. General Comments
Director Lazarus indicated a desire for future discussion, after the budget is finalized, on the following topics.
Cell phone policy for students
State's mandate to record meetings
  Director Lazarus also addressed the topic of complaints to him by staff members against Dr. Granger which allege inappropriate disciplinary actions taken against staff. He asked for the opportunity to review a list of past disciplinary actions, and he encouraged staff to share their concerns with him so he could address them.
