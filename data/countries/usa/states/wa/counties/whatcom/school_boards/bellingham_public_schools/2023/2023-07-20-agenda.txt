Explanation of Issue:
In June 2010 the Board adopted Policy 6800 in order for the district to comply with state regulations pertaining to the Asset Preservation
Program (APP). We must comply with APP in order to be eligible for state construction assistance funding for future school modernization
projects.

One of the specific requirements associated with APP is that on or before April 1 of each year, the Board will receive an annual report
pertaining to the condition of the districts facilities that were built after December 31, 1993, and for which the district received state
construction funding assistance. The affected facilities in our district are Birchwood and Happy Valley elementary schools, Kulshan and
Shuksan middle schools, and Bellingham and Squalicum high schools.
The attached document is the 2020 building assessment report prescribed by OSPI. The Condition Rating is a summary rating taking into
consideration the condition of all major systems at each school including foundations, walls, roofs, windows, doors, electrical, plumbing,
heating, etc. All of these ratings exceed the OSPI Building Condition Standards.
