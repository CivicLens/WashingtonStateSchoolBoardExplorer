----- Written Comment(s) ----1. Sara Cohee:<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Taking out very
crucial bus stops for our young children who are not capable to be on their own is an accident waiting to happen. Making my
child wait on a 50 MPH road where there are industrial workers and trucks flying by every single day going 50 or higher and
passing other cars. Car accidents each year due to the icy conditions on this 50MPH road. There was a young lady killed last
year due to icy conditions and speeding on this very road K NE/4.2 where my child is supposed to stand. Kids who are in
Elementary should not be waiting on a road like this at all, it is already bad that our middle school age kids and high school
have to wait there. At least they understand to not go in the road. Road K NE specifically is an industrial road, due to the
horrible budget cuts those extra routes were taken out and now putting my child at RISK of an accident or death and the other
children on this road. It is unfortunate this would be one of the traumatic changes for them. Please do better for our children,
please put our routes back in place.
