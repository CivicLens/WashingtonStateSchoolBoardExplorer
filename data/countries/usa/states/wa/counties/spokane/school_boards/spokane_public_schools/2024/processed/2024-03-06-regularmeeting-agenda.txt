Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation:
Approve issuance of a purchase order to Southwest School Supply Inc., Ontario, CA in the amount of $102,648.00 plus tax for
the districts supply of copier and printer paper.
Tabulation:
See below.
Background:
This invitation to bid supports current semi-annual usage. The product is for use in the district print shop as well as printers and
copy machines located throughout the district. Copier paper will be received in four equal shipments of 840 cases per delivery
through June 2024, stored in the central warehouse and distributed as requested by schools and departments. Shipments will be
increased or decreased as needed depending on usage during the school year. Centrally purchased paper goes through a
rigorous testing process to assure appropriate paper quality for most uses.
The recommended award is to the responsible and responsive low bidder. In the unlikely event that the product awarded is found
to be not acceptable for district use after delivery or the vendor is unable to supply the product, it is further recommended that
authorization be granted to proceed to the next low bidder and award to that bidder whose product fully meets acceptance
criteria. This expenditure will be paid from the general fund.

In conjunction with the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), the School District conducts a Building
Condition Assessment of buildings that are part of the Asset Preservation Program (APP) and report the results in a public
School Board meeting.

Every six years, all schools in the School District are assessed. Every year a select sample group of schools are assessed. This
assessment reports the condition of that sampling of schools compared against the Building Condition Standards (BCS). The
BCS consists of five major components: substructure, shell, interior, services, and furnishings. A copy of the report is attached.
The select group of schools is as follows:

Browne
Chase
Ferris
Hamblen
Hutton
Jefferson
Lewis and Clark
Lidgerwood
Lincoln Heights

Linwood
Logan
Ridgeview
Salk
Stevens
Westview

This year the building assessment was conducted by the Capital Projects and Planning staff and the results were forwarded on
to OPSI. The results of the assessment show no significant changes in the previous years building review.
