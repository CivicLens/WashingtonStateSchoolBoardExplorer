reimbursed by warrant. Before disbursements are made they are carefully checked for accuracy and proof that the
goods or services have been received, are satisfactory, and that previous payment has not been made. All vouchers for
payment of goods and contract services are approved by the auditing officer and then listed on voucher registers which
are presented to the board for approval at the next regular meeting. Board approval of district disbursements is
required by RCW 42.24.080. Vouchers audited and certified by the auditing office required by RCW 42.24.080, and
those expense reimbursement claims certified by RCW 42.24.090 have been recorded and the listing made available to
the Board.
Policy # 6215 states in part, "All claims for the provision of goods and services, other than payroll, must be pre-audited
and certified by the district's appointed auditing officer/designee. The form shall provide for the authentication and
certification by such auditing officer that the materials have been furnished, the services rendered, and that the claim is
a just, due and unpaid obligation. Warrants shall be approved by a recorded affirmative vote of a majority of the
board."
