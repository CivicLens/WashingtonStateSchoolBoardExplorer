In May 2020, the board adopted new competency based credit policies in response to the State Board of
Education's emergency rules related to the COVID-19 pandemic. New language is being added to these
policies to ensure cultural responsiveness and equity according to recent SBE rules. At the board's work
session on March 22, 2021 it was acknowledged that the district does not intend to expand or extend the
use of mastery-based credit beyond the pandemic emergency. Therefore, updates to these policies
include WSSDA's recommended language related to the new SBE requirements, but language specific to
expanding the use of mastery-based credit has not been included. The board had an opportunity to
review and discuss these updates at the April meeting, and is now asked to approve "Second Reading"
and adoption of updates to the following policies:
2402 English Language Arts Mastery-Based Credit
2403 Math Mastery-Based Credit
