This past year Ms. Gant has been able to get most of our programs approved for funding. She is still working on getting our Annual class (high school year book) and horticulture approved. When she began last year many of our frameworks had not been approved due to all of the changes made by OSPI in the past couple years which has made navigating the CTE programs more complicated.
