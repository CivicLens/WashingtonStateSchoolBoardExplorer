Dwelling Inspection Program
Life Safety Inspections
This is a summary of the process for dwelling/life safety inspections for residential rentals.
Dwelling/life safety inspections largely occur during the move-in process for new students,
although they may occur at any time at the request of the tenant or property owner.
The dwelling inspection program is a service provided at no cost to the applicant. A life safety
inspection will only be performed when the tenant, owner, or the owners agent makes a request
in writing by filling out a Dwelling Inspection Request Form.
A building inspector will arrange a time for an inspection with the person submitting the request.
The inspector will contact the owner and/or property manager to inform them of the inspection
request and invite them to the inspection. The inspector will record the results of the inspection
using the Citys Dwelling Inspection Checklist and the correlating report form. A building
inspector may provide additional resources to a tenant such as contact information for the

Whitman County Public Health, WSU Student Legal Services, and the Washington State
Landlord Tenant Law.
The tenant and the owner/property manager will be notified of the inspection results, including
any corrections that are required, and the timeline for correction. After any necessary corrections
are made, a report or a note will be added to the file.

Recommended Action :

Public Content

By motion, adopt the attached resolution awarding
contract 24-02, Sidewalks 2024, to Knox Concrete LLC
for the bid amount of $254,150.00.

The scope of contract 24-02, Sidewalks 2024, provides for the following:
Schedule A sidewalk maintenance addressing the north section of Sunnyside
Hill (Davis Way to Center Street) in Pullman, consisting of the removal and
replacement of select existing sidewalk panels and occasional concrete curb
and gutter, along with grinding of raised sidewalk panel edges. See the
attached exhibit indicating Schedule A maintenance locations.
Schedule B sidewalk maintenance elsewhere, in miscellaneous locations
scattered throughout Pullman. Schedule B work pertains primarily to repairs
that are required as a result of Maintenance and Operations (M&O) division
activities (for example, replacement of sidewalk disturbed during water service
or other utility repairs). The contract language provides flexibility to designate
specific work locations and associated repairs under this schedule up through
September 15, 2024.This is advantageous since several repair locations are
not yet known (i.e. they have not occurred yet but are inevitable in the coming
days).
Schedule C construction of two bus shelter concrete pads (one on Valley Road
and the other on Merman Drive) and installation of a rectangular rapid flashing
beacon (RRFB) pedestrian crossing system at Fairmount Drive near Planet
Fitness. This includes constructing 143 linear feet of new concrete sidewalk (5to 8 feet wide), including two ADA concrete curb ramps, along with associated
work and miscellaneous related features. See the attached exhibit indicating
Schedule C work locations.
Bids for this project were opened on July 24, 2024, and four proposals were received.
Knox Concrete LLC is the low bidder at $254,150.00. The Engineers Estimate is
$192,628.00. A copy of the bid summary is attached for reference.
Staff recommends awarding this project to Knox Concrete LLC for a total contract
amount of $254,150.00. Funding for Schedules A and B of this project is from the
Street Fund, Stormwater Fund, and the Water and Sewer Maintenance Budgets of
the Utility Fund. Schedule C funding is from the Transit Fund. The contract stipulates
construction to be complete by the end of November 2024.

Recommended Action :

By motion authorize the execution of Amendment No. 3 to a
Water Quality Combined Financial Assistance Agreement
between the City of Pullman and the Washington State
Department of Ecology for the Decant Facility Project.

Public Content
The City Council previously authorized the execution of a Washington State
Department of Ecology (DOE) agreement via Resolution R-20-20 for the design and
construction of a Decant Facility. The City Council authorized an amendment to the
agreement titled Amendment No. 1 via R-71-22. Said amendment converted the
agreement to design only, so that staff could apply for a new grant to fund
construction of the Decant Facility using current cost estimates, as the original
agreement did not have sufficient construction dollars for the project to move forward.
Council ratified a second amendment, Amendment No. 2, at their January 9th
meeting, which revised the grant funding expiration date from December 31, 2023, to
June 30, 2024. City staff have since completed all grant deliverables and submitted
our final grant payment request to DOE prior to the June 30th grant expiration date. In
order to close out the grant agreement with DOE, a third amendment, Amendment
No. 3, is required by DOE. Amendment No. 3 will de-obligate the remaining unspent
funds, which amount to $10,731.26.

Recommended Action :

Adopt the attached resolution authorizing execution of
the new Interstate Agreement for the Palouse Basin
Aquifer Committee.

Public Content
The Palouse Basin Aquifer Committee (PBAC) is a voluntary, cooperative, multijurisdictional group comprised of representatives from the cities of Pullman and
Moscow, Whitman and Latah counties, and Washington State University (WSU) and
the University of Idaho (UI). PBAC has existed in some form since 1967 with a
mission to ensure a long-term, quality water supply for the Palouse Basin region.
PBAC is officially recognized by both the Idaho Department of Water Resources and
the Washington Department of Ecology.
In 2003, the agencies entered into a 20-year Interagency Agreement that formally
formed the Palouse Basin Aquifer Committee. The purpose of PBAC was to work
cooperatively on water resource problems and issues, while maintaining a
consideration of the benefits of growth activity and economic development. By
working together, PBAC's continued goal is to implement the Palouse Basin
Groundwater Management Plan, enacted in 1992, by analyzing and researching the
Palouse Groundwater Basin. The Committee monitors groundwater levels and annual
water usage, continually advocates for education opportunities and encourages
conservation within the community, and pursues and supports the development of
supplemental and/or alternate water supply sources.
The original PBAC Interagency Agreement expired on August 21, 2023, and was
extended an additional year by a Memorandum of Agreement, authorized by Pullman
City Council on November 14, 2023, by Resolution R-51-23. This extension is
intended to allow time for the Committee to prepare and execute a new agreement.
This proposed new Interstate Agreement is attached, with a stipulated term of 10
years, and will allow PBAC to continue its ongoing regional work.
Note that in this proposed agreement, the total annual funding contributions were
revised to reflect the new amounts listed below for the fiscal year beginning July 1,
2024.
$53,750 for pumping entities (Pullman, Moscow, UI, WSU)
$8,483 for others (Latah County and Whitman County)

For Pullman specifically, this change reflects a $6,750 increase in the total annual
contribution amount to PBAC. The last time funding levels changed was in 2019, and
before that, in 2007. Moving forward, consistent with previous practice and as
stipulated in the agreement, PBAC will establish annual contributions annually with a
two-thirds majority vote necessary to change assessment amounts from the previous
year. Pullmans funding for PBAC comes from the Water budget of the Utility Fund.
