The board requires those who wish to speak (but not all attendees) to sign in so that the board has a tally of individuals who wish to speak and can call them forward. When called forward, individuals will identify themselves and proceed to make comments, limited to 3 minutes per person, time may not be deferred during the public meeting and should be presented respectfully. The board is not obligated to respond to questions or challenges during the public comment period. The board’s silence will not signal agreement or endorsement of the speaker’s remarks.

The chair may terminate an individual's statement when the allotted time has passed and may interrupt a speaker to require the same standard of civility the board imposes on itself.
No public comment was given.
  4. Special Recognition
A. Guest Speaker - Beth Mills Introduction and SPED Program and Team - The board recognized Beth Mills for her extensive experience in education, particularly in special education. Beth shared her personal story and how she came to work at LCSD. She also shared the successes of her high school life skills students during remote learning, emphasizing that they experienced no learning loss.
  Director Quintasket welcomed Beth Mills to LCSD and expressed her commitment to enhancing the learning environment for students with special needs, advocating for education on diverse communication styles. Director Quintasket asked, how can we make the learning environment better for the students who do have special needs, you know, such as autism or ADHD or other things that they may have in their lives? How can we also use the time to educate other students about different communication styles, and different ways people learn, just to make our students more well-rounded citizens in the future? They will have these people in their learning environment and they will go out into the world and at some point, will need to be able to interact with people that may communicate and learn differently than them. Do you have any ideas on how to integrate that into our schools with our students at all age levels?
  Beth Mills supported this initiative, highlighting the importance of individualized educational programs and integrating students with disabilities into general education settings. This is one of her professional goals with her supervisor in terms of continuous improvement. For improving things for students, students with disabilities, if they are eligible for special education, an individualized educational program, which is something that is put together to make sure that they are getting the services that they're eligible for with accommodations. Another thing that helps both the students with disabilities and students without disabilities is to make sure that they're being served in the least restrictive environment, which means that they're spending the most time that is appropriate for them in the general education setting so that they have time to not only receive that great instruction academically but also gain social skills. The research is very clear that this is beneficial, not just for the students with disabilities, but for the students without disabilities to be educated alongside them.
  This Wednesday, Beth is scheduled to meet with the special education team to review data, determine the focus areas, set goals, and create a vision for continuous improvement. Plans for professional collaboration sessions aimed at educating all staff on necessary accommodations were discussed. Director Quintasket also raised concerns about early access to services for students in tribal preschools, indicating a need for early intervention strategies.
The board thanked Beth Mills for being at LCSD and expressed their appreciation for her being here and making a difference every day. 
  B. McKenzie Clark - Pep Band – The board recognized Mackenzie Clark and the Pep Band for all their efforts around the music and choir program. Specifical recognition to the Pep Band because they spend so much time performing at athletic events and concerts. Mr. Clark thanked the board and appreciates they continue to keep music as part of our curriculum providing an option for so many kids in our community. The Pep Band performed outside the district office building for the board directors and audience members. President Deyo requested for the Pep Band to work on performing the La Conner Alma Mater song at district events.
  5. Action Items:
A. Strategic Plan Update (Engage) – Based on the previous discussion, President Deyo shared the following proposal for updating the engagement standard of the Strategic Plan.
The leadership team will revisit the progress utilizing the Washington State Standards in English Language Arts and Math to align these standards horizontally and vertically in grades K-12. They will report to the board in June 2025 on district progress.  The alignment in both ELA and Math will be complete by June 2026.
The district continues to explore and expand course offering options to support student interests and enrollment, graduation rates, and classroom engagement.   New offerings and ideas will be presented to the board each year in March.
The district leadership team will report each February on the progress of MTSS implementation as required to meet state standards in 2028.
Director Agen moved, and Director Pedroza seconded to update the engagement portion of the strategic plan as presented. Motion carried 4-0.

B. 2024-25 MOU with ESD 112 DOL CDL Service Agreement Skills Test Agreement -
Although ESD 112 is in Vancouver, this agreement allows us to use it for educational instructors or specialized services and to improve student learning. We can run our bus drivers that are ready to take the testing through them. Because of the location and access, we probably wouldn’t utilize it, but we have it in place if needed.
Director Agen moved, and Director Pedroza seconded to approve the 2024-25 MOU with ESD 112 DOL CDL Service Agreement Skills Test Agreement as submitted. Motion carried 4-0.

6. Discussion Item:
A. Review IReady Benchmark Assessment Report (Beth Math and Reading) - Director of Teaching and Learning Beth Clothier presented shared strategies being implemented in response to benchmark assessment data in math and literacy, emphasizing targeted interventions and professional development for teachers, and noted positive student feedback regarding math engagement. Below is a summary of the information presented.
Data-Driven Adjustments and Professional Development Initiatives - In response to recent student performance data, LCSD has implemented targeted actions to address specific learning needs, particularly in math and literacy. Key actions include:
Expanded Professional Development in Mathematics:
All secondary teachers participated in a two-day "Building Thinking Classrooms in Mathematics" workshop at the ESD, focusing on encouraging student engagement and fostering independent mathematical thinking. As a result, teachers are now experimenting with strategies like using vertical whiteboards to promote student collaboration and discussion.
Teachers are reorganizing student groups based on differentiated skill levels, allowing for "just-in-time" learning to address varied student needs. This approach helps tailor instruction to individual student levels, facilitating personalized support in math.
Increased Focus on Specific Learning Gaps:
With an overarching goal to increase student performance by 10 percentage points, the instructional team has been working with data to identify learning gaps at the individual student level. This granular approach allows teachers to focus on specific areas where students may need additional support to reach grade-level proficiency.
Professional Development in Literacy and Language Acquisition:
Plans are underway for three additional hours of building-level professional development in language acquisition for elementary educators. A literacy coach will begin training staff in December, with a structured training program set to start in January, aimed at enhancing early literacy instruction.
A Teacher on Special Assignment (TOSA) role is being explored to provide ongoing literacy support, specifically in K-2 literacy, which remains a primary area of focus.
Supporting Teachers in Curriculum Implementation:
Teachers are adapting to demanding curriculum structures, such as the Bridges program, which involves multiple resources and requires significant preparation time. While this has been challenging, students are reportedly enthusiastic and engaged in math, reflecting a positive learning environment despite the program’s complexity.
Integration of UDL and Specialized Support:
Although Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is not yet a central focus, the district is committed to incorporating it gradually to enhance accessibility and learning for all students. Currently, the focus remains on providing specific interventions through LAP staff, particularly for students with identified needs.
Power Hour for Middle School Students:
Middle school students benefit from a "Power Hour," a small-group instructional period focused on both ELA and math. This flexible period allows students to receive support based on their individual needs.
Structured Rollout of GLAD and Literacy Programs:
In a structured approach to avoid overwhelming staff, the district plans to introduce GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) strategies first, followed by structured literacy initiatives. This phased approach aims to ensure that teachers can integrate each program effectively before moving on to additional strategies.
These ongoing efforts reflect a commitment to supporting student growth through personalized instruction, professional development, and strategic curriculum implementation, aligning with LCSD’s goals for academic achievement and community impact. The data graphs are available in BoardDocs.
