we can pass a motion at that time.

3. PUBLIC COMMENT [GC-3.3]
3.01 Receive Public Comment
Mr. McLaurin explained the format of Zoom in receiving public comment. Mr.
McLaurin said we received one public comment for tonight’s meeting from Jon
Salisbury. He writes:
“I think it is important to first look at the metrics for the Ferndale School
District regarding the increase in Covid-19 cases. Keeping schools open,
even hybrid mode, while there is such a dramatic increase in cases here is
not the safest option for anyone.”
Mr. McLaurin responded that since the question about County versus District
metrics has come up several times before, he feels confident responding to this
part of Mr. Salisbury’s comment by saying that one of our guiding principles is
to follow the recommendations of the Whatcom Health Department. He said we
have been advised by the Health Department to use County numbers, not
District-specific numbers, because the populations in individual school districts
are too small to define an accurate trend line. We are working hard to be as
consistent as possible, rather than pick and choose which Health Department
guidance we follow.
Mr. McLaurin reminded audience members that Dr. Quinn writes answers to
questions received from the community during the month and posts those under
the Public Comment item on the BoardDocs agenda and also on the website.
Mr. McLaurin said the second part of Mr. Salisbury’s comment, about the safety
of in-person learning, will be addressed by our next agenda item.
4. FOCUS ON STUDENTS
4.01 Update on Reopening School
Mr. McLaurin said Dr. Quinn has informed the Board of her recommendation
that we continue the course we are currently on, but that we pause any
expansion of our in-person learning until further notice. Mr. McLaurin called on

Superintendent Dr. Linda Quinn and her team to share their research and
rationale.
Dr. Quinn reported on the district’s current situation, our three guiding
principles, the conversations the district had with the Whatcom Health
Department, and our survey of what other districts are doing.
Executive Director of Human Resources Mr. John Fairbairn reported on metrics,
numbers of COVID-19 cases in Whatcom County, contact tracing, and the new
daily COVID-19 update emails he sends out to staff and board members. Mr.
Fairbairn acknowledged staff concerns and the avenues for staff to share those
concerns.
Executive Director of Teaching & Learning Kellie Larrabee reported on the
continued check-ins with principals and elementary teacher leaders. She
acknowledged the concerns staff have with the holidays approaching. Ms.
Larrabee reported that we continue to look at what systems are working well
and what needs to be refined further, including some attendance issues. Ms.
Larrabee reported that overall, the stakeholders are happy to have students back
to in-person learning.
Executive Director of Teaching & Learning Dr. Faye Britt reported that secondary
staff are working to turn their plans for in-person targeted support into virtual
targeted support. She reported on the workshop opportunities that the
secondary staff have provided students at the high school. Dr. Britt reported that
the one place we have had to roll back is athletics.
The Executive Team answered questions from the Board.
5. FOCUS ON DISTRICT OPERATIONS
5.01 Report on Capital Projects Bond
Assistant Superintendent of Business and Support Services provided an update
on the Capital Projects. He reported on the completion of the secure vestibule
projects. We reached a milestone and got the design turned in for the permit
review, which is a standard process. Mr. Deebach reported that the work was
done in 3 ½ months; it normally takes 6 months. Mr. Deebach reported that they
decided we needed to accelerate our design process to get the bid work out at the
most favorable time of year. The primary bid package on the high school will be
out mid-January. He said that should save us quite a lot of money.

Dykeman architect Tim Jewett talked with the high school staff today and
presented the design. Mr. Jewett told staff that he expects going out to bid this
time of year will deliver a lot more value and by being out early, they will be able
to deliver most or all of the alternates as part of the design work. Dykeman team
will have a series of meetings with all FHS departments to go through the
specific details of their spaces. FHS staff will be able to see what has been
designed and weigh in on some of the specific details of things in the rooms.
Mr. Deebach announced that we have a community town hall meeting scheduled
on December 9 from 6-7 pm via Zoom where Dykeman will do the same
presentation for the public. The community can submit questions via chat or
email.
Mr. Deebach answered questions from the Board.
5.02 Update on the addition of Land Acknowledgement at Board Meetings
Dr. Quinn and Ms. Deardorff reported on the development of the land
acknowledgement. We are waiting for a good time when we can continue our
discussion with officials from the Lummi Nation. Dr. Quinn let the Board know
that we have a joint meeting with the LNS Ed Board scheduled for December 15.
This may be a topic we can discuss during that meeting.
