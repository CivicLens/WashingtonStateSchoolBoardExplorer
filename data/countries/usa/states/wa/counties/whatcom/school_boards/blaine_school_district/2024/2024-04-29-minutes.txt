  2. Action
A. Resolution 2324-08 Adoption of 2024-2025 Reduced Educational Program
Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger expressed appreciation for SEIU's time in meeting with him on April 25, 2024. The district will continue to consider SEIU's suggestions moving forward, and there will be more discussion with the board in the future about SEIU's proposal. Dr. Granger mentioned that BEA contacted the board by email but did not schedule a time to meet with the district's leadership team. He reiterated that the district's leadership team does not desire to reduce the educational program, but it is necessary and his recommended reduction plan has not changed.

Director Lazarus indicated by telephone that he had no additional comments.

President Freeman expressed a belief that the board is advocating for the benefit of students.

Director Galbraith thanked those who contacted him. He indicated that he did not receive anything that would change his mind about the current recommendation, and the suggestions received would be considered in future planning.

Director Creydt stated that she did not get all of her questions answered. She commented on the possibility of moving money around, as well as on the current low fund balance, and she would like an opportunity for more discussion time.

Director Swinburnson expressed his appreciation for the additional time. He had hoped to receive alternative ideas that would supplant what had been proposed by the district's leadership team. He thanked everyone who reached out to him and shared his hope that everyone can begin working together towards the same goal. He committed to reaching out personally to legislators, and asked that everyone who reached out to him do the same. He agreed that the original proposal is the "best of the worst" option.
