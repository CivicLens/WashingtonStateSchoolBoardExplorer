Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the July Budget Reports as
presented.

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
Budget Reports - July:
Fund balance and net cash: As of July 31, 2024, fund balance is a negative $331,103 and net cash is approximately $2.3million. Projections
currently put the ending fund balance back into the positive, in the $1M range. Revenues for July came in at $10 million while monthly
operating expenditures remained steady at approximately $7.8 million. Fund balance and net cash were expected to show an increase in
July due to the scheduled larger allocation of state apportionment in the month of July. As of July 31, 2024, year-to-date expenditures along
with outstanding encumbrances represents almost 100 percent of total expenditure capacity. Program expenditure levels and outstanding
encumbrances are continually tracked and compared to total budget capacity. Program detail reports are showing anumber of departments
with outstanding purchase orders/encumbrances beyond their current budget. Those departments include, Special Education, District-wide
Support, Food Services, and Pupil Transportation. For the Special Education Department, the overage is due to additional staff and
contractual services that were required to meet student needs. Safety Net funding that will be received in August will provide for a portion of
relief for these needs/overages. Besides that, historically, the overages showing at this juncture of the year are due to open Purchase Orders
(PO's) that are not actually going to be utilized and need to be closed. Departments have been asked to review the nature of their
outstanding PO's. Meanwhile, Finance is closely monitoring spending trends, and pressing for restraint on spending.
Interfund loans:

As of July 2024, the District General Fund had received approximately $2.67 million in interfund loans from the Capital Projects Fund (as
authorized by board resolutions 24-07 and 24-10). These loans were necessary to provide cash-flow for June, July and August obligations.
As of the end of July, approximately $2.32 million of the loans that General Fund received from the Capital Projects Fund have been repaid
along with interest that had accrued on those funds, which amounted to approximately $13,000. As of July, the balance remaining is
approximately $351,000 which is expected to be repaid by the close out of the 2023-24 fiscal year.

Previous Board Action:
Board acceptance of Budget Reports for June 2024 occurred at the August 12, 2024, regular board meeting.

information about the district's funds. In particular, it also contains additional sections giving ten years or more of statistical data in areas
such as staff, levies and taxes, and enrollment.

Considerable effort has been made over the years to collect and compile this data for the Board.The level of detail and reporting illustrated in
the Superintendent's Annual Report promotes an understanding of the scope and character of the financial needs and accomplishments of
the district to our Board, our taxpayers and interested citizens.

Public Schools website.

Submitted by:
Kerri Helgeson, Director of Equity and Student Well-Being
Background Information:
Over the past several years, mental health services were provided to Arlington School District students who would not have received them
otherwise. These mental health counselorsworked continuously with 6-7students each day at all of our schoolsand engagedin several
mental health triage situations. Mental health support has been an increasing need across the District and is identified as a priority for
Arlington students. This would be the same contracted mental health services as previousyears. Allwould becontracted by PHD#3 to provide
services.
Administrative Considerations:
The district will provide space for each mental health counselor in their respective buildings to meet with students, staff, and families, in
exchange for services at no cost to the families. PHD#3 has a separate agreement with each mental health counselor to reimburse them for
services that cannot be billed, or the difference between insurance reimbursement and cost for service.
Budgetary Impact:
There will be no fiscal impact to the district by engaging in these cooperative agreements.
