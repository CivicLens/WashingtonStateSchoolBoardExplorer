Re: Sea Mar/Visions Contract
Attached is acontract withSea Mar/Visions for the Board's consideration. The contract represents a small increase per student
per day. This is the first increase in the daily rate for four years.
The contract amount is $20.25 per day for regular education students, and $5.00 per day additional for students eligible for
special education services. Sea Mar Visions is a residential treatment center for high school girls. The program serves between
20 and 30 girls per month. A student is typically placed at Sea Mar for 30-90 days.
Sea Mar hires its own teachers for the school, but we supervise the instructional content and any Individual Education Plans
(IEPs) in place for students.
If you concur with my recommendation for approval, please submit for the Boards consideration.

RE: Out-of-State Travel for Fairhaven Staff
I am writing to request approval for a five-day, four-night trip to Baltimore, Maryland to attend the National Middle School Conference,
November 3 7, 2010. Fairhaven staff is committed to researching best practices for interventions and core content delivery for a true Middle
School Model. This conference is offered once a year, and provides a variety of middle level sessions with world renowned presenters such as
Sean Covey, Ruby Payne, and Rick Wormeli. Additionally, this conference aligns with our vision and mission for Fairhaven Middle School.
As we undergo changes this year, we are focusing on identifying factors that create a middle level Blue Ribbon School, where every student
achieves academic and social success through duplicable Blue Ribbon School attributes.
ITINERARY AND LEARNING ACTIITIES:
We are sending a group ofFairhaven Middle School staff members. Each staff member serves in a different content/grade level. An additional
staff member, whois a member of the National Middle School Association Board of Trustees will serve a dual role as FMS staff and NSMA
board memberwill join the group at the event. She will join the group at the event.
TRANSPORTATION:
On Wednesday, November 3, 2010, our team will depart from Bellingham airport at 9:30 am and arrive in Baltimore airport at 11:05 pm. We
will be staying at the Baltimore Convention Center Hotel until Sunday, November 7, 2010. Our flight departs from Baltimore on Sunday,
November 7, 2010 at 6:00 am and arrives in Bellingham at 2:30 pm.
COST:
Staff will utilize their Individual Staff Development funds to off-set the cost of the trip. The total cost of the trip is $5,282.00 (not including
the deduction of ISD money). We have established a small allocation of professional development funds to help cover the additional costs:

Cost of registration $2,661.00 (does not include meals)
Cost of hotels $716.00 (Plus taxes)
Cost of travel $1,905.00
SUPERVISION:
Ann Buswell, assistant principal, will be here full time to monitor and supervise the Fairhaven Middle School campus. We have arranged for
one staff member, Jim Zurcher, to serve as a back-up administrator in case Ann becomes short staffed or needs additional supervision
assistance at FMS.
APPLICATION:
Each staff member was selected from a larger pool, based on availability, interest and cost. These attendees are a part of a larger Middle Level
Research Team that will continuously meet throughout the year to focus on best practices for Middle School Models. This team will bring
back information and share their learning, understandings and research to the greater staff. A proposal will be made in early spring that will
address how we will serve level II and level III students with interventions systematically here at Fairhaven. This team will also be

investigating the Middle Years International Baccalaureate Program and fold this program in as part of our research on successful Blue
Ribbon Middle School Models.

TO: Doug Kyles, Executive Director School Administration
FROM: Jeff Coulter, Principal Columbia Elementary
RE: 5th Grade Class Field Trip to NCI Mountain School
DATE:September 21, 2010
I am writing to request approval for Columbias fifth graders to attend the North Cascade Institutes Mountain School. Pre-planning for this
three-day, two-night field trip, during the week of April 20 - 22, 2011, has included criteria set forth in District Policy and Procedures (2320)
on student trips.

Mountain School Program Summary
Mountain School is a nationally recognized residential environmental education program offered by North Cascades Institute in cooperation
with North Cascades National Park. The program is designed to connect students to the diverse ecosystems and communities of the national
park through outdoor hands-on, experiential-based education. The multi-disciplinary Mountain School curriculum is aligned to Washington
States Essential Academic Learning Requirements (EALRs), Grade Level Expectations (GLEs), and the Washington Assessment of Student
Learning (WASL) to facilitate the transfer of information learned at Mountain School back to the classroom and to each students daily life. In
addition to academic lessons learned at Mountain School, students develop important social skills and a sense of respect for one another and
their surrounding environment.
The new 5th grade Ecosystem Explorations program gives students the opportunity to hike the Learning Center trails, investigate the
biodiversity of North Cascades plant communities through a hands-on science investigation, learn about migratory birds that stop over in the
North Cascades during their travels, and examine the tiny, intricate and often overlooked features of the forest community both in the field
and under a microscope back in the lab. Program activities extend through the evening.

What and Where is Mountain School
This award-winning program is operated by the North Cascades Institute at their new Learning Center. The new Learning Center is located in
North Cascades National Park in the heart of the North Cascades mountain range. The 16 building facility includes classrooms, labs, library,
dining hall and lodges. It is located on the shores of Diablo Lake with numerous trails and three trailside learning shelters. The food service
program focuses on offering appealing and wholesome food choices that are local, organic and sustainably produced. Mountain School
participants stay in three dormitory-style lodges.

Instructors and Chaperones
Students break up into small hiking and learning groups with approximately a one to five adult/student ratio. North Cascades Institute
education staff design lessons, provide leadership and train instructors at Mountain School. All instructors have CPR and first aid
certification. In addition, many instructors have Wilderness First Responder (WFR) training, an advanced 80-hour first aid certification. Five
parents will also serve as chaperones, participating in the learning activities as well as supervise the dorms along with the teachers. They will
be fingerprinted as per District Guidelines.

Costs
The full cost of the program is $300 per participant. With scholarships and grant funds North Cascades Institute provides a sliding scale for
schools based on their poverty index. The cost for Columbia students is $125 per participant. The Columbia Parents Association will provide
scholarships to families in which this is a hardship. Every student will be allowed to attend, even in the event of financial hardship.No child
will be excluded due to the costs associated with this learning experience. The classroom teacher and student teacher attend at no charge.

Communication With Families
This will be the fifth year Columbia fifth graders will be attending Mountain School. The fifth grade teachers informed parents of our fifth
graders about the Mountain School experience at Curriculum Night. Pending Board approval, we will hold a planning meeting for families in
late January. Parents will be required to provide written permission using the districts forms for this specific field trip.

Consent
Our adopted rules of Parliamentary Procedure, Robert's Rules, provide for a consent agenda listing
several items for approval of the Board by a single motion. Documentation concerning these items has
been provided to all Board members and the public in advance to ensure an extensive and thorough
review. Any item which appears on the consent agenda may be removed by majority vote of the board
and placed on the regular agenda.

To: Doug Kyles
From: Steve Morse, Roosevelt Elementary Principal
Re: 5th Grade Class Field Trip to NCI Mountain School
Date:September 20, 2010
Roosevelt Elementary is requesting permission from the Bellingham School Board to attend Mountain School with all of our fifth grade
students from May 9-11, 2011. We have attended Mountain School for the past four years and it was an excellent educational experience for
our students. The North Cascade Institutes Mountain School is a nationally recognized environmental education program, located in North
Cascades National Park. We have examined District policies regarding overnight field trips and believe that this program and our plan meet
all requirements.

Curriculum
This nationally recognized program and curriculum is well aligned with the Washington State Fifth Grade Level Expectations in science and
literacy and designed to enhance classroom learning. While at Mountain School, students spend the majority of their time outside, hiking on
trails and exploring mountain ecosystems first-hand through interdisciplinary activities. Experiential, hands-on activities in science, math,
language, music, art, social studies and conservation fill days to the brim. Program activities extend through the evening. With pre-trip and
post-trip lessons included in the teachers guide, teachers have ready-to-go, useful tools to help prepare their students for Mountain School and
make connections in the classroom following their field experience.

What and Where is Mountain School
This award-winning program is operated by the North Cascades Institute at their new Learning Center. The new Learning Center is located in
North Cascades National Park in the heart of the North Cascades mountain range. The 16 building facility includes classrooms, labs, library,
dining hall and lodges. It is located on the shores of Diablo Lake with numerous trails and three trailside-learning shelters. The food service
program focuses on offering appealing and wholesome food choices that are local and organic. Mountain School participants stay in three
dormitory-style lodges. Each room sleeps two to three participants with two shared bathrooms in each lodge.

Instructors and Chaperones
With one class per session, students break up into small hiking and learning groups with approximately a one to five adult/student ratio. All
instructors have CPR and first aid certification. In addition, many instructors have Wilderness First Responder (WFR) training, an advanced
80-hour first aid certification. Six parents will also serve as chaperones, participating in the learning activities as well as supervising the
dorms along with the teachers. They will be fingerprinted as per District Guidelines.

Costs
The full cost of the program is $300 per participant. With scholarships and grant funds, the North Cascades Institute provides a sliding scale
for schools based on their poverty index. The cost for Roosevelt students is $100 per participant. The PTA has decided to provide bussing and
$25 per student. This leaves individual families with a donation of $75 per child. We encouraged the students to raise this money over the
summer through extra family chores or other additional efforts. We believe that this additional effort on their part will help them value the
experience, and begin to see the relationship between work and getting what one wants. The PTA will also provide scholarships to families in
which this is a hardship. No child will be excluded due to the costs associated with this learning experience. The classroom teacher attends at
no charge.

Communication With Families
Parents of Roosevelt students support this idea and indicated that they would both want their child to attend and be willing to contribute $75
to help pay the costs associated with the trip. Parents were very enthused about this experience last year and this years 5th grade parents can
hardly wait! Pending School Board approval, parents will be asked to give written permission using the Bellingham School District Mountain
School Trip Release Form.
In the event that students do not attend the North Cascades Institutes Mountain School, a plan is in place to offer an alternate placement.
