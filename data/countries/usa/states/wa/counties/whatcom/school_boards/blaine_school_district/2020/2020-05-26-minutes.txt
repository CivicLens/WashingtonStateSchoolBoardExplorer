     Todd Nunamaker, Dougal Thomas, Joan Lotze, Charles E Gibson, Laura McKinney
  B. Pledge of Allegiance
President Gibson led in the Pledge of Allegiance.
  C. Board Comments on the Agenda
There were no comments on the agenda.
  2. Reports
A. 2019-20 HomeConnection Annual Report
Program Coordinator Nate Button had provided a written report in advance for board review. Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger relayed information from his meeting with Mr. Button earlier in the day. During the school facility closure, HomeConnection has taken away many valuable lessons regarding remote delivery of educational programming which can benefit the district as a whole. The HomeConnection program continues to be popular with an ongoing waiting list for new students. A music teacher was added to the program this year, and Dr. Granger commended Mr. Button and his staff for doing a great job.
  B. Enrollment Update
Due to the emergency closure of school facilities, and changes in reporting, enrollment reports will no longer be available for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter had provided a financial report in advance for board review. Dr. Christopher Granger explained the difficulty in comparing this year's figures to prior years due to the changes and delay in revenue collection. Due to facility closure, there were also fewer expenditures this spring. Needs are being considered in order for the district to provide 1-to-1 technology devices to students in the 2020-21 program year. Dr. Granger described the audit report received from WSSDA which calls out suggestions for improvements and will be reviewed at the Board's upcoming retreat. Ms. Porter will return for the board's June meeting, particularly to review plans for the 2020-21 budget.
  D. 2020-21 Budget Planning Update
Dr. Christopher Granger provided the board with an update on the 2020-21 Budget Planning process. He anticipates that all teachers will return, other than those who retire or resign. Uncertainty regarding enrollment for next year makes it difficult to determine the district's needs. As of last week, kindergarten registration is much lower than typical. The district has a pool of quality applicants for teaching positions, but vacant positions will not be filled until needs are determined. Dr. Granger described the negative impact that the district would experience if a large amount of students transferred out to online programs in other districts. A resulting decrease in revenue could require the district to cut programs which would then not be available when those students return to the classroom in the fall of 2021. All options need to be considered and clearly communicated to the community. Discussion continued regarding direction from the state level for reopening in the fall of 2020. A final list of options will be provided by the state in early June for each district to select from. Until there is a COVID vaccine, we cannot expect school to resume as it was before. The primary consideration is how many students will be allowed to share classroom space, as well as how many hours of instruction the school will provide each day. Preliminary planning is underway to determine what would work best for Blaine families, as well as the operational needs of each building and department on our campus. Director McKinney asked about consideration of year-round school. Dr. Granger indicated that year-round school would be a local bargaining issue and unions are not likely to approve that option.
  E. Superintendent's Report
A virtual graduation ceremony has been scheduled on June 12 for the Class of 2020. It will be posted to the district's YouTube channel at 5:00pm. Dr. Granger described two options for creation of the ceremony presentation which will depend upon whether Whatcom County is in Phase 1 or Phase 2 of the governor's reopening plan. Neither option allows for any gathering, and the final plan will need approval from the County Health Department as well as the district's legal counsel. Director Gibson asked if there could be any option for an in-person ceremony, but Dr. Granger explained that it would not be allowed by the Health Department which has the legal authority to make decisions about school facilities being open. Director McKinney commented on the lack of elected representation in the County Health Department. Dr. Granger continued to explain the video plan and described how the district's recent investment in technology for video production is being utilized in order to create the best possible ceremony video.

Dr. Granger provided an update on activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. He also elaborated on the following takeaways from this experience
New methods have been established for the delivery of professional development.
Opportunities have been revealed to reach students who are chronically absent.
Consideration should be given to remote delivery of instruction on snow days so that make-up days are not needed.
Safety considerations have been identified to allow a remote work option for essential personnel.
As a small district, cross-training is needed to ensure that essential functions are not interrupted in the event that critical staff are unable to perform duties.
As part of the district's WIAA appeal earlier in the school year, an Alternative Learning Analysis was completed and is now being reviewed. This item's relevance is even more significant now as the district looks for ways to expand online offerings for K-12 programming in anticipation that some families may not send their students back as buildings re-open. This came timely and will inform the district's ability to deliver services in an online environment.

OSPI has approved the district's application to grant emergency waivers to seniors. High School Principal Scott Ellis is working through the process to determine the maximum need for individual waivers.

The Field Turf project continues to progress on track for completion at the end of July. Work is currently focused on ground preparation.
  With the uncertainty around what next school year will bring, it is even more important to closely evaluate the district's staffing needs for the 2020-2021 school year. Current needs are being assessed to determine the district's internal capacity before filling positions. Administrators will continue to evaluate position needs on a case-by-case basis within each department.

Options are still being considered for the scheduling of a Board Retreat in the summer, once COVID related restrictions are loosened.

Dr. Granger provided an update on Senate Bill 5395 - Comprehensive Sexual Health Education. The legislation's timeline and required content were reviewed. There will be no sexuality content or curriculum at the K-3 level where the focus will be on aspects of social emotional learning. Students in grades 4 and 5 will learn to understand and respect personal boundaries, develop healthy friendships, and gain a basic understanding of human growth and development. In grades 6-12, instruction will focus on medically and scientifically accurate physiological and sociological development along with healthy relationship skills, healthcare resources, and knowing when and how to help a friend. Parents will continue to have the right to opt out. Most districts, including Blaine, are already providing sexual health education and will be able to continue using the same curriculum. Clear communication will be needed to ensure that parents are aware of what is being taught. Efforts are underway to provide increased information on the district's website regarding all areas of curriculum. Director McKinney asked if the actual content could be placed on the website and Dr. Granger explained that copyright laws may prohibit that, but parents have been, and will continue to be, able to review the content in person at the District Office.
  3. Consent Agenda
President Gibson asked for clarification regarding what determines the content that is placed on the monthly Consent Agenda. Dr. Granger explained that it typically contains routine and necessary items which do not require discussion. President Gibson reiterated the directors' option to have any item removed from the Consent Agenda to allow for further discussion. This should be done at the beginning of the meeting, when the president calls for comments on the agenda. No directors indicated a wish to remove any item from the Consent Agenda at this meeting.

     Second Reading and Adoption
These policy adoptions were considered in response to WAC 180-51-050 which requires local school boards to adopt an authorizing policy before districts can award competency-based credit to students. Dr. Granger commented that, because it is the district's position that classroom education is the best option for students, it is the desire of the administration and, he believes, the board to remove these policies after the pandemic emergency ends.

The board approved "Second Reading" and adoption of the following new policies related to credit for competency/proficiency in required subject areas.
2402 Credit for Competency/Proficiency in English Language Arts
2403 Credit for Competency/Proficiency in Math
2404 Credit for Competency/Proficiency in Science
2405 Credit for Competency/Proficiency in Social Studies
2406 Credit for Competency/Proficiency in Fine Art

The board approved "Second Reading" and adoption of Policy 2413 Equivalency Credit Opportunities.
  Motion by Dougal Thomas, second by Todd Nunamaker.
