The Meridian School District #505 held a regular board meeting on January 10, 2024, where several key topics were discussed. The board moved into an executive session to review the performance of a public employee, after which they reconvened and adopted the agenda and consent agenda, which included the approval of meeting minutes, personnel reports, accounts payable, payroll, and an affiliation agreement with Western Governors University. Dr. James Everett expressed appreciation for the school board directors, and Principal Todd Torgeson recognized the Meridian Middle School Science team for their efforts in building systems to master academic standards.

Dr. Everett also presented the MSD Board Operating Protocols and the Revised 2023-24 Plan of Work for first reviews, both of which will be revisited for approval at the January 24 board meeting. The meeting included presentations from various teams regarding their academic focus areas and strategies for measuring student progress. Student representatives shared positive experiences related to the Winter Wishes program and the Give Before You Get activities. The meeting concluded with a call for board directors to fill roles as Legislative and WIAA Representatives and was adjourned at 7:33 p.m.
