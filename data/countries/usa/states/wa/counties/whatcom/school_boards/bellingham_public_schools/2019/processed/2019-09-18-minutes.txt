OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
September 18, 2019 - 1306 Dupont St., Bellingham, Washington
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Diaz Hackler called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. Present: Directors Kelly
Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler (President), Jenn Mason, Quenby
Peterson, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder). She acknowledged
that this meeting is being held on the ancestral homelands of the Coastal Salish people.
Audience:
No public testimony was offered.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
The school year is off to a good start, although the loss of a staff member impacted many
across the district.
Dr. Baker expressed appreciation to everyone who served on bargaining teams over the
past several months and thanked Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources Bob
Kuehl and Director of Human Resources JoAn Steiner for leading this work. All
employee groups now have finalized their collective bargaining agreements.
The Aug. 27 all-staff kickoff had great energy, and overall feedback on the equity,
diversity and inclusion (EDI) portion of the event has been positive.
Student enrollment is approximately 57 students less than was projected last spring, and
we are continuing to refine staffing.
Staff has been working on numbers for the February 2020 operations and technology
levies. Dr. Baker presented the current thinking regarding the amounts that will be
requested, as well as the estimated tax rates based on those amounts. A citizen’s
campaign will convene soon.
The following updates on capital projects was given:
o Work on the transportation facility has begun and should be finished by early
spring.
o The Squalicum softball, baseball and soccer fields are also being worked on.
o The Sehome soccer field and tennis courts have been completed since the all-staff
event and are now in use by students.
o We will close on the purchase of the Barkley district office site within the next
few weeks; an RFQ (request for qualifications) will be put out for an architect for
that project.
o A Sunnyland educational specifications committee will be formed this fall or
winter; the challenge of that project will be the small footprint.
