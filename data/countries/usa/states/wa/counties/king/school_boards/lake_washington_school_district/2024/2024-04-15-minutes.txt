It’s important that our work is transparent, available to the public, aligned with best practices and is responsive to district directions and students’ success. It is important that our budget reserves meet legal and policy requirements. Dr. Holmen provided an update on the community information and engagement around the budget, including the seven different messages that have been sent to the community, the two ThoughtExchanges and the December survey. The Budget Advisory Committee continues to meet to provide feedback on our budget process and our plans to communicate with our community.
