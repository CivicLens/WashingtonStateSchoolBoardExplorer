Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation
It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt the attached resolution accepting the Final Commissioning Report prepared
by McKinstry, Inc. for the Libby Center Classroom Remodel.
Background/Rationale
As part of the Office of Superintendent of Public Instructions (OSPI) requirement for state match school construction funding, the
Board of Directors shall adopt a resolution accepting the final Commissioning Report for a school project.
The purpose of the commissioning process is to ensure that all the building systems are installed and operating as designed. A
detailed explanation of the process for the Libby Center Classroom Remodel is included in the report.
The independent commissioning agent is hired during the design process and makes recommendations to the design team and
reviews the drawings and specifications. During construction, the commissioning agent assists in reviewing product submittals to
verify they meet the project specifications. The commissioning agent inspects the project site during construction to verify that
equipment is being stored, installed, and started up properly. Finally, the equipment is tested to confirm that it performs as
designed.
A checklist log of all the issues found during the commissioning process and the date the issue was resolved is included in the
report.
The checklist is first reviewed by the contractor and their subcontractors to ensure that all the items found on the log were
completed correctly. The commissioning agent is then tasked to verify the contractor has completed the checklist and indicates
the status of each item in the report. The Capital Projects staff then verify that the commissioning agent has shown that all
outstanding items are complete. The Capital Projects staff have reviewed the report and agree that the checklist has been
completed.
As part of the OSPI D-funding application process, a resolution from the Board of Directors accepting the report is required in
order to receive State reimbursement for the commissioning process. The purpose of the resolution is to indicate to OSPI that
the process was completed. As a reminder, this project was funded through the 2018 bond.

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order to Pure Filtration Products, Spokane WA in the amount of $100,000.00 plus tax for the districts oneyear supply of air filters.
Background:
In January 2016, the warehouse study report recommended the district consider implementing the practice of direct shipping
regular custodial supplies. Given the floor space required to store filters, truck space necessary to deliver filters and the
standardized sizes and frequency of filter replacement, a solicitation was issued requesting bids for filters to be delivered direct
to each district building. The filters will be received in five shipments as scheduled by the Facilities Department and will be
delivered directly to district sites.
This is the fifth of five possible one-year renewal options. Expenditures for this product will be paid from the general fund and are
considered fair and reasonable.

Recommendation:
Issuance of purchase order to Home Depot Pro, Spokane, WA, in an estimated amount of $250,000.00 for a 12-month supply of
roll towels, hand soap and dispensers.
Background:
In May 2013, the district standardized all dispensers for hand towels and hand soap. Standardization is more efficient for
inventory of supplies and maintenance and/or repair of dispensers. Additional benefits are decreased custodian time to restock
towels and the improved health standards of a hands-free system.
This recommended purchase is accessing Omnia Contract No. 22-07. The pricing is considered fair and reasonable and will be
paid from the general fund.

TOTAL

$115,991.60

Background:
The district purchases approximately $200,000.00 of custodial supplies annually that are stocked in the warehouse and supplied
to schools as needed. The bid climate for these products does not produce the best pricing if the product price is held for an
extended period. In order to obtain the best possible pricing a solicitation will be issued every 3-4 months. Given the total
expenditure for the product requires a bid, each purchase will be solicited as a formal bid. The Purchasing office utilizes an
electronic solicitation system, Public Purchase, which allows for efficient solicitation and tabulation making more frequent
solicitations possible.

All recommended awards are to the low responsible bidder offering acceptable products. In the event that products identified are
determined unacceptable for district use or the vendor is unable to provide the product as bid, it is further recommended that
authorization be granted to proceed to the next low bidder(s) and award to that bidder whose product fully meets acceptance
criteria. Actual purchase orders may be adjusted slightly to accommodate specific product packing quantities.

Recommendation:

Approve estimated expenditures for the 2024-25 Running Start Program with Washington State Community College and Eastern
Washington University as presented below.
Background:
Running Start is a program that allows 11th and 12th grade students to take college courses for dual credit at Washington
community and technical colleges and four-year universities. In 1990, the Legislature created Running Start as a part of the
Learning by Choice law, which was designed to expand educational options for high school students. The budget bill sets the
state-wide average apportionment rate for running start students and requires 93% of that rate be paid to the state colleges and
universities for students participating in Running Start with 7% retained by the sending district. Running Start rates for the 202425 year are in the amount of $10,037.85 per FTE for Non Vocational education and $10,916.85 per FTE for Vocational education.
Running Start Program with Community Colleges of Spokane (SCC) Estimated cost $3,064,790.
For the 2024-25 fiscal year, the estimated expenditures for the Running Start Program with CCS are calculated based on an
estimated number of FTE for both non-vocational and vocational running start participants. Formal Agreements or
Memorandums of Understanding for Running Start Programs with Community and Technical Colleges in the state are not
required; therefore, a formal Agreement between the district and Community Colleges does not exist.
Running Start Program with Eastern Washington University (EWU) Estimated cost $967,582.
For the 2024-25 fiscal year, the expenditures for the Running Start Program with EWU are calculated based on an estimated
number of non-vocational program participants. Formal MOUs are no longer required with four-year universities.

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order to Optic8, LLC, Kirkland, WA in the amount of $250,000.00 for LED screen for virtual studio at
NEWTech Skill Center.
Background:
This recommended purchase replaces outdated production studio equipment with technology that is the future for virtual
production (VP) of movie, TV and advertising industries. By building a VP studio, NEWTech will not only be bringing the program
up to industry standards but will also be ahead of the curve. Although VP has been around for about five years, it still represents
only 1% of its expected total reach, and its adoption is set to skyrocket. By investing in this technology now, the district is giving
our students a significant advantage in an industry that is rapidly expanding, providing them with experience that will set them
apart from the competition. By adding a VP studio to NEWTech, the district will be one of the first, if not the first, high school in
America to have this technology. Very few colleges and universities possess this technology. Consequently, district students will
have a significant experience advantage over 95% of graduating college students in this industry.
The district only received one bid, Optic8, and was determined to be the low and responsible bidder and met the specifications of
the solicitation. This recommended purchase will be a general fund expenditure with $120,000.00 of the expenditure being paid
from grant funds.

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order to Northwest Textbook Depository, Lake Oswego, OR in the estimated amount of $219,683.00
plus sales tax for G6-8 OpenSciEd Science, printed by Accelerated Learning, for student consumable materials with some
teacher editions.
Background:
The Board approved OpenSciEd for adoption as the middle school science curriculum in April 2023. The adoption team reviewed
multiple methods of obtaining the hardcopy materials for this Open Educational Resource (OER). Since an OER is developed by
a group of educators, not a publisher, it was not possible to negotiate a life-of-the-adoption pricing structure for all the printed
materials.
It appeared, at the time, the District could provide print files developed by the OER to a printing contractor and printing costs
would be minimal in comparison to preprinted materials from a publisher. The Curriculum and Instruction team realized over the
course of this last year that method was not the best to provide a consistent product for our educators and students.
Following re-evaluation of all preprinting options available for this OER material, Accelerated Learnings product was selected.
This expenditure will be paid from the general fund.

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order to Northwest Textbook Depository, Lake Oswego, OR in the estimated amount of $170,000.00
plus sales tax for Grade 6-8 Illustrative Math printed by Kendall Hunt for student consumable materials.
Background:
The Board approved Illustrative Mathematics for adoption as the middle school math curriculum in June of 2018. At the time,
costs for consumables were expected to stay constant throughout the life of the adoption at approximately $145,000.00 yearly.
This curriculum being an Open Educational Resource (OER), developed by experts in education, not a publisher, meant the
District could not negotiate a ten-year pricing structure. Printing prices jumped substantially a few years ago, and the District is
still getting the same unit pricing.
Last year, we were a little tight on quantities especially for the accelerated classes, leading us to re-establish an appropriate
surplus as we continue to move closer to the end of the adoption in the 2027-2028 school year.
This expenditure will be paid from the general fund.

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order to Newsela of New York, NY, in the estimated amount of $129,999.00 plus sales tax for an online,
distance learning recovery tool utilized through the 2024-2025 school year district-wide at the secondary level.
Background:
Newsela allows middle and high school teachers to address the challenges of student learning loss by supporting and increasing
literacy across multiple contents areas, synchronously and asynchronously. The two content areas that will provide this literacy
support are ELA, Science and Social Studies.
The site posts seven to ten new articles daily that are current, as well as historical, literary, and science based, encouraging
student engagement. The articles in Newsela will help teachers more effectively differentiate instruction by accessing texts
published at five reading levels.Fully implementing this tool provides classroom project-based units and SEL supports.
These articles also provide questions, quizzes, writing prompts to monitor and track student understanding and comprehension,
and allow students to set SMART goals for improvement. The articles contain embedded vocabulary support by providing in-text
definitions and identify power words which align with common core standards.
Curriculum and Instruction took advantage of a district-wide field test and low-cost professional development opportunity the
spring of 2021 to confirm the assessment above and ensure stake holder buy-in, including a public notice to ensure another such
tool was not available. This will be the fourth year of use. The cost represents over 50% off from the published pricing.
The expenditure will be paid from the general fund.

Recommendation:
It is recommended that a purchase order be issued to Really Great Reading of Cabin John, MD, in the estimated amount of
$406,000.00 plus tax for a complementary handwriting curriculum for Grades K-2 starting SY2024-25 and running the same
duration as the K-5 ELA Adoption cycle.
Background:
Curriculum and Instruction presented Really Great Reading as one of the publishers chosen by the adoption team for the K-5
ELA Adoption. The Board approved this curriculum in April 2023. Part of the focus for K-5 ELA is handwriting in kindergarten
through second grade.
The District has been using a handwriting curriculum from Learning Without Tears for years. When the adoption team, through
an extensive two-year evaluation process, found Really Great Reading was best as one of the solutions to address the new
focus on literacy, it became obvious that a handwriting curriculum aligned with it should be evaluated.
The adoption team chose to maintain the use of the Learning without Tears product throughout the 2023-2024 school year while
they evaluated other options. Through that process, the handwriting curriculum by Really Great Reading was found to be fully
aligned and superior to other options.
Purchasing worked with Really Great Reading to negotiate a nine-year contract with pricing that is over 37% off published pricing.
The expenditure will be paid from the general fund.
