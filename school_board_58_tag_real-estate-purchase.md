The Mead School District Board of Directors held a Special Webinar Board Meeting on July 2, 2024, where they approved the purchase of 153 acres of land, known as the Cuzzetto Farms Property, for $2.4 million to be used as a future school site. Facilities & Planning Director Ned Wendle presented the purchase details, including the completion of due diligence and the district's available Capital Projects Fund. The discussion highlighted water rights and the implications of recent legislation allowing water provision outside of the Urban Growth Area for school construction. The board unanimously approved the purchase, with Director Nolan and Director Burchard commending the value of the negotiated price and thanking Mr. Wendle and his team for their efforts. The property will be leased to a local farmer to manage noxious weeds while the district prepares for future development.
