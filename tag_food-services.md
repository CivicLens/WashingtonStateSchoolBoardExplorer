The Toledo School District Board of Directors held a special meeting on August 26, 2024, where significant discussions revolved around food services and the revised building schedule. The board recommended transitioning food services to Sodexo, with Mr. Hutchinson emphasizing that the decision should prioritize the quality of food over profitability, echoing concerns raised by various parents, including Naomi Padgett and Mr. Hutchinson himself, about the poor quality of meals provided by the current service, Chartwell's. The board's decision reflects a shift in policy aimed at improving student health and satisfaction regarding school lunches. Additionally, the board approved a revised building schedule that alters the start and end times for Toledo Middle School (TMS) and Toledo High School (THS) while keeping the schedules for Toledo Elementary School (TES) and the Community Partnership Academy (CPA) unchanged.
