 Finance and Operations Department Recognition: In follow up to recently
announced special district recognitions, Dr. Baker introduced Washington State
Auditor Pat McCarthy who presented the State Auditor’s Stewardship Award in
recognition of the district’s outstanding commitment to safeguarding public
resources. Ms. McCarthy read a letter (see Attachment A) describing the award, and
she congratulated the finance and operations team, represented at this evening’s
meeting by Assistant Superintendent Simone Sangster, Director of Business Services
Kathryn Weilage, Accounting Supervisor Elizabeth Crocker, and Accountant Susan
Swan. She noted that of 2,300 annual state audits, only 10-12 agencies receive this
special recognition each year.

for their participation in recent ceremonies. The last day of school was June 14. Endof-year staff professional development activities are currently underway.
 Collective Bargaining: Bellingham Education Association/Bellingham School
District bargaining is continuing.
 Facilities: The following updates were included in a recent message from Dr. Baker
to families and the community:
o Sehome High School: Since the construction project is ahead of schedule, the

in January 2019.
o District Office: The administrative team continues to explore the pros and
cons of remodeling the existing office versus relocating to another site.
