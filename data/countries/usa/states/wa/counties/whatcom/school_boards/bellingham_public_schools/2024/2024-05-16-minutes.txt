Audience:
• Pearl Petaia, a music specialist at Kulshan Middle School spoke about the importance

at Whatcom Middle School talked about the importance of music education and
believes the current middle school schedule excludes students from participating.
• Angel Raphael is a sophomore at Bellingham High School who participates in choir
and orchestra. She believes orchestra is as important as academic classes and that
music can be a coping mechanism for humans.
• Sandy Rogers is a music teacher at Meridian Middle School District and talked about
how Meridian has managed to offer music classes to students during the school day.
• Freyja Junell spoke about the importance of music to her.
• Nick Strobel has been a music teacher in the Bellingham Public Schools for 23 years.
He noted that the district does so many things well, including the fifth grade strings
program, but the current middle school schedule prevents students from continuing
with music classes in middle school.
• Cambria Schmidt is the parent of students at Kulshan Middle School and Sehome
High School. She believes the lack of music choices in middle school is impacting the
high school music programs.
• Patty Bourne teaches future music educators at Western Washington University
(WWU) and believes in the importance of arts education for all students. The

1.5

partnership between the school district and WWU allows her to be in the schools to
witness the wonderful music educators.

many of the elementary schools. He and others are forming an advocacy group for

program.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• With only a handful of weeks left in the school year and in anticipation of next school
year, fifth grade students have visited their future middle schools and eighth grade
students have visited the high schools. Seniors are excited to be finishing their AP
tests and are looking forward to graduation.
• Many districts across the state are experiencing the challenges of the state not fully
funding education. He’s hopeful that news coverage of the financial struggles of large
districts like Seattle will help to spread awareness about what districts are facing.

Geneva Elementary School; the Sehome High School environmental club’s work
party with Whatcom Million Trees; the Since Time Immemorial family night at
Whatcom Community College; and Parkview Elementary School’s walking school

School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Mason appreciated hearing from so many Alderwood students during the recent
school visit. It’s apparent that students are passionate about what they care about, and
it’s also evident that students feel a sense of community in their school. She’s also so
happy that the students, staff and families have the beautiful new school.
• Mr. Ritchey attended a wonderful Squalicum High School art show. There were subcommittees formed at the board’s recent retreat, and work is progressing with those
sub-committees. The WSSDA regional meeting was great, and it was marvelous to
have state superintendent Chris Reykdal there to explain where the state is with
education funding. The Alderwood visit was fantastic, and he was struck by how
students can talk about important things at such a young age.
• Ms. Rose formerly lived across the street from Alderwood, and she’s happy to see
how passionate the neighborhood is about their new school. She enjoyed hearing
from students this evening about the importance of the arts. The recent board retreat
was great, and she values that time and the conversations among the board members.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler shared that her fifth-grade granddaughter got to visit the middle
school she’ll be attending next year. She loved the retreat, and the WSSDA regional
meeting was amazing. The Alderwood visit was great, and the District Office open
house was lovely.
• Mr. Benjamin was sorry to miss the Alderwood visit. He attended the state auditor’s
exit interview and noted they didn’t have much to say because there were no findings.
He attended the District Office open house and heard amazing comments from those
who toured the new building. He agreed that the opportunity for board members to
connect with each other at retreats is fundamental, and he was proud to have the
entire board at the WSSDA regional meeting. He leaves for Spokane tomorrow to
attend an all-day WSSDA retreat on Saturday.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
DB:
• There is evidence of modest gap closure with Hispanic/Latinx and low-income groups.
• There have been significant increases in dual credit and CTE participation, particularly among
female students.
• The growth particularly in CTE participation and offerings is impressive.
CDH:
• Despite the difficulties students had during the pandemic, it seems hopeful that dropout rates
seem similar to pre-pandemic.
SR:
• Our overall district graduation rates have improved over the past 10 years beyond state
averages and made important progress towards the rates reflected from the high bar peer
district. This progress is commendable.
• Bellingham’s very strong graduation rates for students with disabilities at 7 years reflects the
values of The Bellingham Promise and illustrates our district’s impressive commitment to
transitioning students effectively to life after public schools. The 90% graduation rate is
especially commendable.
• Our progress in closing the gap for low income vs. non-low-income students 5 year
graduation rates are evident from the data provided; the progress is commendable.
• The notable increase in CTE dual credit is an impressive reflection of the district’s investment
in and dedication to the CTE programs and is commendable outcome. The breadth of
programs offered is impressive and will directly help support engaging student interest and
belonging with applied knowledge and learning opportunities.

The graduation gap between Hispanic/Latinx and non-Hispanic/Latinx Bellingham students
decreased to 6 percent from 8 percent in year-over-year comparison.
Glad to see pandemic doesn’t appear to have had a big impact on dropout rates.
Encouraging to see the gap narrowing between Hispanic/Latines students and low-income
students – especially the latter given poverty’s overall impact on students and families.
Especially heartening to see lasting trends in improved graduation rates over time among
groups.
CTE growth is commendable given how impactful courses can be and how well offerings are
set up to meet diverse student interests and talents.

3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
DB:
• The graduation gap with multilingual learners increased, though it is recognized these
numbers fluctuate significantly.
• The report indicates that income is perhaps the most significant contributor to graduation rate
gaps.
CDH:
• None.
SR:
• My interpretation of the testing impacts to grade 10 students is that these anomalous scores
may be the result of COVID era effects due to reduced student familiarity with the
standardized tests and a lack of understanding for the use of these standardized test scores
specific to this cycle of measurement. I was glad to learn that we will likely see improvement
in this area in future cycles.
• Our district stands out for our strong focus on proficiency gaps and the district team’s efforts
to close these gaps. I would anticipate continued progress in this area as we see reduced
COVID era effects and with the efforts already underway and would like to voice support for
the importance of these continued efforts.
4. Comments on the report itself.
DB:
• Appreciate blending the data sets with the report narrative, makes for a much smoother read.
CDH:
• Great report, as always.
SR:
• This is an exceptionally rich and transparent report on key outcomes related to The
Bellingham Promise. Thank you for such a well developed and documented report.
KR:
• Integrated data set makes it much easier to see. This report is always great – thorough and
clear.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
DB:
• The report shows active progress in developing academic practices and standards that meet
policy expectations, as the Board has come to expect from this superintendent and his team.
Some notable examples of commendable efforts include, but are not limited to: expanded
inclusionary efforts, more focus on behaviorally dysregulated students and mental health
supports, use of AI tools, new math curriculums, alignment with Board Ends, STI integration,
expanding IB schools, and broad stakeholder involvement.
CDH:
• The board is impressed with the work done on coming up with a new inclusion definition. It
seems like a lot of work went into it.
• The board is also impressed with the professional development on artificial intelligence. It’s a
new and growing field and staying on top of current trends is very smart.
• More impressive work has been done towards improving the Since Time Immemorial
standards. Getting the outdoor learning grant to expand the salmon release, the storytelling
pathway and Treaty Day are all very important things.
SR:
• The new definition of inclusion is an excellent framework for fully realizing the value of
inclusion for all students and the community at large. This definition really underscores the
positive network effects of inclusion and is commendable as an expression of equity and
impact for all students.

The thoughtful alignment of professional learning and district-wide goals as well as the
significant variety of professional learning course offerings is a commendable demonstration
of the district’s commitment to ongoing improvement in instructional innovation.
The district’s ongoing commitment to the mental health of students and successful pursuit of
grand funding to complement previous activities is commendable as both a pragmatic
response to changes in our communities and effective recognition of the important role of
mental health in the realization of The Bellingham Promise.
Without a comprehensive background in instructional innovation, it can be challenging to
provide observations on the quality of specific initiatives pursued this year, however, as a
community member given the opportunity to meet with a variety of students and staff the
innovation appears both effective and engaging for students and staff. In their energy and
enthusiasm for initiatives like STI and IB commendation is easily justified.
Appreciate both the new definition of inclusion and the thoughtfulness and intention behind it
– especially the recognition that ALL children are capable. Glad to see the professional
development on AI and Since Time Immemorial curriculum – valuing both where we’re
going and where we’ve come from.
Report demonstrates clear alignment with board ends, in addition to meeting other criteria and
needs.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
DB:
• The report shows that the superintendent has developed a robust process over the years to
build the district calendar consistent with policy. This year is no exception with broad
involvement of stakeholders, attention to evolving holidays, bargaining changes, enhanced
professional development, family engagement and broad communication strategies.
CDH:
• The district calendar is so important to so many people. The board feels that Dr. Baker always
does such a thorough job in involving so many groups, as requested by the board. Good job,
also, in keeping the calendar (and families) up to date when it changes, like after inclement
weather.
SR:
• The district’s important commitment to professional learning is reflected in the adjusted
calendar dates for early dismissal. Developing these opportunities for collaboration and
growth are valuable as schools continue to respond to changes in education, society and
technology. Many families are understandably challenged by the need for these early releases,
but the district’s work to develop and communicate the calendars proactively and effectively
is commendable.
KR:
• The district calendar is a key example of the many needs and priorities of the myriad
stakeholders the district serves. Creating a calendar designed to thoughtfully meet such a
range of almost contradictory needs is commendable, particularly as it also so clearly reflects
the values of The Bellingham Promise.

Snow day approach is a perfect example of the thoughtful intention behind scheduling and
communications and demonstrates the district/superintendent’s understanding of the role the
district plays in the community at large.
