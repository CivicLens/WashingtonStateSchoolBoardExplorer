The purpose of this communication is to request that the School Board of Directors authorize Superintendent Greg Baker to
renew the attached agreement with the Bellingham Public School Foundation (BPSF). This proposed agreement for the 2012-13
school year is defined by the same terms as our current agreement. BPSF will increase its pledged amount of financial support
to the District to $29,700, and continue to provide coordination services with donors and community partners.
In return, the District will continue to provide the Foundation with office space, equipment and resources as outlined in the
agreement to support the Foundations communitywide efforts on behalf of all of our schools. The Foundations support will
continue to exceed the district resources provided. This support helps our newly revitalized Foundation continue to grow in its
second year with a new Board of Trustees.
BPSF is committed to raising awareness and financial support to help ensure the best possible education is available to all
students in Bellingham Public Schools. Its grant program this year funded many direct classroom grants and positively impacted
thousands of students, meeting needs that would have gone unfunded without local community support.
For more information about the Foundations current activities and support: http://foundation.bellinghamschools.org/
The Foundations second annual Race for Education event in partnership with Communities in Schools is on Saturday, Oct. 6 this
year.

Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Business and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
Attached is Resolution 7-12 which, if approved by the Board, would formally adopt the 2012-13 Bellingham School District
budget.
The final proposed 2012-13 budget for the Bellingham School District is attached (Budget Final 1213.pdf). The state required
budget format, Form F-195, is also available upon request.
Please note a new section has been added to the document this year, Section II Program and Departmental Budget Information.
This section includes specific information pertaining to both instructional and support programs within the General Fund.
This final budget is identical to the preliminary budget in four of the five funds (Capital Projects, Debt Service, Associated
Student Body, Transportation Vehicle) and there were minor changes in the General Fund Budget as explained below.
General Fund revenues increased by $82,905 between the preliminary and final budget as a result of increased revenue
associated with our Federal Homeless grant and State apportionment related to Alternative Online Learning.
General Fund expenditures increased by $83,467 between the preliminary and final budget as a result of a combination of
increases related to the increased homeless grant funding and increased benefit cost calculations.
Those changes resulted in a total ending fund balance decrease of $562 to $4,145,161, 3.97% of expenditures.
After carefully overseeing the budget process and a thorough review of the budget assumptions and resulting calculations, I
recommend that the 2012-13 budget be adopted in accordance with Resolution 7-12.
