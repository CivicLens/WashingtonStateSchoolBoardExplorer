As we near the end of this challenging school year, the Mount Baker School Board wants to take
a moment to recognize and deeply appreciate the hard work and dedication of our staff, students,
families, and caregivers. We have heard from many families and students who are struggling with
the isolation created by the pandemic and we have seen our community step up to support one
another. We have also witnessed a division in the District, based in part on concerns about
teaching assignments.
In an effort to bring unity to our community, we want to address these misconceptions, many of
which were expressed during the public comment period during the Boards Special Meeting on
April 15.
No teachers (or other staff) have refused to work during the pandemic. The District received and
was able to accommodate some staffing assignment requests; in some cases, staff chose to take
a leave of absence for the year. With about thirty percent of the District students continuing
remote instruction, the District has been able to balance remote teaching assignments with the
remote learning need all remote teachers have full class loads. Mount Baker must follow all local,
state, and federal law, and the COVID-19 health guidelines including those limiting how many
students could be in a classroom together prevented the combining of cohorts until after Spring
Break.
We also want to dispel the perception that teachers have had a lighter workload during the
pandemic than they have had in the past. This could not be further from the truth. Teachers and
staff have worked implementing new curriculum, learning new teaching platforms, keeping
families and caregivers informed of changes, and staying connected to students. Teachers, like
parents, students, and everyone else, are working harder than ever to get through this pandemic.
Our teachers and support staff are your friends and neighbors. For the good of our children and
community, we must strive to create a positive working environment where all can thrive. We look
forward to getting through this pandemic with a greater appreciation for one another and a united
Mount Baker community that is stronger than ever before.
