Elementary principal Amy Cox, Title 1 director Jami Rushing and 4th grade teacher Darby Souza presented information on the
Title 1 Part A Plan for 2023-2024 & 2024-2025. The components to the plan included a needs assessment, school-wide reform
strategies, activities to ensure mastery, coordination and integration and combining/blending funds matrix. Title II-A and Title IVA funds will be used for professional development to improve effective instruction and safe and supportive learning
environments.

B. Elementary School Improvement Plan
Mrs. Cox, Mrs. Rushing and Mrs. Souza presented the elementary school improvement plan for 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. The plan
will focus on a positive school climate, positive communications to staff students and community about current activities and successes
and reviewing testing data to make sure students are increasing their reading ability by showing growth from fall to spring using the
current year's benchmark assessments. Data was presented showing growth in reading scores in all grade levels K-5. Elementary
teachers are focused on professional development that will help continue the work to improve reading ability. Phonics and handwriting
will be two key areas of focus since data has shown a link between those and reading ability. The plan will also focus on parent
engagement nights in the elementary which have been very successful this year. There is one more event being planned for May which
will make three engagement nights for this school year.
4. OLD BUSINESS - ACTION ITEMS
Policies have been tabled until April to allow for more time to present those already under review along with some additional policies
that have come to the attention of Superintendent Stewart.
