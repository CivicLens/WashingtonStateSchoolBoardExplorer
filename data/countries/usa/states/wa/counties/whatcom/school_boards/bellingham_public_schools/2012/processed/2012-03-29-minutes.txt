MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING
OF THE
BELLINGHAM SCHOOL DISTRICT
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
March 29, 2012
The Bellingham School Board of Directors met in special session March 29, 2012 in the Board
Room of the District Office, 1306 Dupont Street, Bellingham, Washington.

OPENING ITEMS
At 7 p.m. President Kelly Bashaw called the special session to order.
Roll Call
Present: Directors Camille Hackler, Steve Smith, Ken Gass, President Kelly Bashaw,
Superintendent Greg Baker and recorder Marilyn Grams. Scott Stockburger was absent.

ACTION
Resolution 4-12, Adoption of 2012-13 Reduced Educational Program
Dr. Greg Baker reported that the legislature has not yet adopted a budget but we anticipate
further reduced funding. Without additional state or federal budget cuts, we need to implement
several budget savings strategies for next year. In the 2011–12 school year, the district mitigated
the impact of state reductions by dipping into reserves. For the 2012–13 school year, the district
cannot continue deficit spending and still maintain the legally and fiscally required level of
reserves. There was budget discussion leading to the proposed adoption of Resolution 4-12.
Ken Gass moved and Steve Smith seconded the motion to adopt Resolution 4-12, Adoption of
2012-13 Reduced Educational Program. The motion carried unanimously.

STUDY SESSION
At 8:20 the Board adjourned to a study session for the purpose of discussing the district strategic
plan, The Bellingham Promise.
At 8:30 p.m. the Board began the study session. The Board is working to build, refine and
improve The Bellingham Promise collaboratively, resulting in a vision, mission, values and work
priorities that are owned by students, staff, families and our greater Bellingham community.
At 9:30 p.m. the Board reconvened in special session.
