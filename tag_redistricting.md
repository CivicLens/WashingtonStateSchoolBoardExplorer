## 2021-12-07 - BLAINE_SCHOOL_DISTRICT (Minutes)

The Blaine School District No. 503 held a special board meeting on December 7, 2021 to discuss and finalize a redistricting plan for the district. The board had previously met on November 22, 2021, and heard concerns from Birch Bay patrons regarding the initial draft redistricting plan. In response to these concerns, Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger and Redistricting Project Manager Robert Schweitzer worked together to develop an alternate plan that addressed the community's desire for better representation. The alternate plan was presented at the meeting and received positive feedback from both board members and Birch Bay residents.

The board discussed the benefits of the alternate plan, which included more compact districts within Birch Bay and a clearer alignment with community interests. Concerns were raised about the historical lack of candidates from Birch Bay and the displacement of the current director in District 4 due to the redistricting. It was clarified that the displaced director would be allowed to complete their current term.

The alternate plan was ultimately supported by both the board and the Birch Bay community, with residents expressing appreciation for the district's willingness to listen to their concerns and address them in a constructive manner. The board agreed to further discuss the redistricting plan at their December 14 meeting.
