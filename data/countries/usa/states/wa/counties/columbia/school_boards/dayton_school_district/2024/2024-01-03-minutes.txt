    3. WORK SESSION TOPICS
A. TOPIC 1 - First Reading Policies: 2410 High School Requirements 2413 Equivalency Credit Opportunities 2415 Performance - Based Pathway for High School Graduation 5005 Employment & Volunteers; Disclosures, Certification Requirements, Assurances & Approval 5271 Reporting Improper Governmental Action (Whistle Blower Protection) 2401 Financial Education Mastery - Based Learning & Credit 6550 Capitalization Threshold for Leases & Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements (SBITAs)
  Policy 2410-High School Graduation Requirements - The changes to this policy is the addition of credit for the work pathway. Students can earn up to two elective credits for paid work (jobs) they may have while going to school. We most likely will not be able to implement these changes until the following school year. Superintendent Stewart recommends the board adopt this policy so we can offer this additional pathway to our students.
  Policy 5005-Employment and Volunteers: Disclosures, Certification Requirements, Assurances and Approval. This is a change in regard to pre-employment drug testing related to Cannabis and possible discrimination if some employees are asked to take a drug test and others are not. Superintendent Stewart reviewed the changes to this policy in regards to cannabis and the possible ramifications of this policy. The board discussed the ramifications of this policy and whether or not this policy should be adopted now or later when more information becomes available. Superintendent Stewart contacted our risk management group and WSSDA to try and get some clarification on this policy.

Policy 2413-Equivalency Credit Opportunities is tied to Policy 2410 and relates to equivalency credit at skill centers and or other, such as paid work, which is clarified in this policy. The mastery based subsection is something our high school is working on and this policy supports that direction.
  Policy 2415-Performance-Based Pathway for High School Graduation - This policy is tied to the previous policies with an RCW update allowing the additional pathway.
  Policy 5271 Reporting Improper Governmental Action (Whistleblower Protection) - There is a change in management resource and cross reference section.
  Policy 2401 Financial Education Mastery Based Learning and Credit - This would be a new policy for the district and focuses on helping students understanding the importance of financial education. The classification for this policy is encouraged.

Policy 6550 Capitalization Threshold for Leases and Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements (SBITAs) - Business manager Eaton explained the focus of the policy and the purpose of changing the SBITAs from a percentage to a fixed amount. The district is required to report any leases on the Notes to the Financial statement and our F196. Mrs. Eaton recommended the adoption of this policy based on the recommendation of the state auditor and accounting requirements for leases.
  B. TOPIC 2 - Superintendent Update & Decisions
Superintendent Stewart gave the board a list of questions to review for our superintendent interviews. Mr. Stewart asked the board to read over the questions and decide what the focus or qualities they will be looking for in a new superintendent. For example, the focus could be on a person who could help the district if there were a financial problems. The focus can change over time thus the turnover in superintendents in some districts. The questions were discussed and will continue to be reviewed as we move forward through the process.
