The Yakima School District #7 Board Retreat on January 8, 2024, addressed several significant issues impacting the district, including a projected budget reduction of $20 million, which was confirmed by Assistant Superintendent of Finance, Jake Kuper. This reduction is influenced by the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) and comes alongside a forecasted decline in student enrollment, raising concerns about the need for social and emotional support for students post-pandemic. Director Raymond Navarro, Jr. emphasized the importance of understanding the factors contributing to this decline, including housing development issues and the rise in private and homeschooling enrollments. 

Additionally, the board discussed special education support, with Executive Director of Special Education, Nancy Smith, presenting on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) policy. The board expressed a desire to ensure that all students, including those with special needs, are included in general education settings. There was a call for clearer data on the impact of inclusion on general education students. The board also requested a draft proposal for future proclamations by January 16, 2024, and discussed strategies for enhancing family and community engagement, aiming for a unified approach to better serve the district's needs.
