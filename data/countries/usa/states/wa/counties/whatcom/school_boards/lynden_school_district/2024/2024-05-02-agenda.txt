Isom Elementary hosted their 1st annual STEAM Fair! The event showcased an impressive array of 87 projects from students in
Kindergarten through 5th Grade. Guest speakers from the community were also in attendance including a veterinarian,
internet safety advocate, Lego and robotics enthusiasts, local artists, and nursing professionals. Isom secured a generous grant
from the Lynden Noon Kiwanis to purchase robot kits which students can program and run from their laptops.
Approximately 45 AVID students from Lynden Middle School took a tour of Bellingham Technical College in order to start
