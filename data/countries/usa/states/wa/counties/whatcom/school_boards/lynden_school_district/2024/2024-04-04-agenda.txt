Lynden Middle School used the March Madness basketball tournament to generate college awareness. Classes chose a team
from the tournament to research and decorated their doors with information about the school including what the
requirements to get into that school are and what types of programs they offer. Students will end March Madness with a spirit
week full of college swag.
Students from Fisher Elementary's Honor Choir had the opportunity to perform at the San Juan Music Educators Association
Festival. Sixteen schools from Whatcom, Skagit, and Island counties participated in the elementary honor choir event. Schools
received the music pieces ahead of time and practiced on their own. All of the schools then came together for one rehearsal
and performed the pieces together. This was the first time Lynden students participated in the honor choir event.
Congratulations!
Lynden High School's Wind Ensemble also participated in the San Juan Music Educators Association Festival and received a
Superior rating for the large group event for the 30th straight year!
Lynden High School's top six-person Knowledge Bowl team proved itself one of the brightest in the state, recently capturing
8th place in the final statewide competition, this coming off a first-place finish at the district finals. Congratulations!
The Youth Mental Health First Aid course led by staff members Coral Bartlett and Stacey Anderson on March 23rd was a
successful event with 11 community members participating. This course for adults introduces common mental health
challenges of our youth, reviews typical adolescent development, and teaches a 5-step action plan for how to help young
people in crisis and non-crisis situations.
Lynden Middle School hosted a community-wide viewing of "Screenagers" on March 25th. This is an award-winning film
that depicts struggles over social media, video games, and academics. The film reveals how tech time impacts kids'
development and offers solutions on how adults can empower kids to best navigate the digital world and find balance. Over
30 attendees from both Lynden and Lynden Christian attended the event.
Lynden Middle School's Chess Club hosted their 2nd Annual LMS vs. Lynden Fire Department event. First responders from the
Lynden Fire Department, Lynden Police, Whatcom Sheriff's Office, and US Border Patrol & Customs participated in the event
where they competed against LMS chess club members. A great time was had by all!
Building leadership teams met last week to collaborate around Multi Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS). This work involving

development of a common understanding of MTSS and Universal Design for Learning.
