The Blaine School District No. 503 held a special board meeting on April 29, 2024, to vote on Resolution 2324-08, which adopts a Reduced Educational Program Plan for the 2024-2025 school year. Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger stated that the district's leadership team does not desire to reduce the educational program but believes it is necessary due to budgetary constraints. The board ultimately voted 5-0 to adopt the resolution, with Director Creydt noting that the adopted plan does not have to be final and additional adjustments should be considered.  

The meeting followed a regular board meeting on April 22, 2024, where Resolution 2324-08 was tabled. During the special meeting, Dr. Granger expressed appreciation for SEIU's time in meeting with him on April 25, 2024, and stated that the district will continue to consider SEIU's suggestions moving forward. He also mentioned that BEA contacted the board by email but did not schedule a time to meet with the district's leadership team.  

The board members discussed the resolution and expressed their perspectives on the proposed reduced program. Director Lazarus participated telephonically, while Directors Galbraith and Swinburnson shared their thoughts on the need for further discussion and consideration of alternative ideas. Director Creydt stated that she did not get all of her questions answered and would like more time for discussion.
