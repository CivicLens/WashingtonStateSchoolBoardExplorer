BACKGROUND INFORMATION

As part of the masterplan development approval process, the District and Careage worked
together to ensure the District’s property on McNeil Street has access to stormwater
retention areas located on other parcels, and adjacent property owners would have
reasonable access to necessary utility services.
Careage is closing on an adjacent parcel and the new owner would like the easement for
sanitary sewer approved prior to the sale. This easement is for a sanitary sewer line that
extends through what will be the playfield and a portion of the parking lot. The easement is
to the County and would require the District to seek approval for any construction that
would interfere with the County’s access to the easement area.

The placement of the line was reviewed by the engineer and architect firms the District
worked with during the conceptual design phase for the elementary school. It was
determined that the placement would not impact the District’s future construction or
sitework.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

I move approval of the McNeil Street Sanitary Sewer easement to Pierce County and
authorize the Superintendent to sign all necessary documents to allow for the recording of
the easement.

Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent
