ABSENCE OF A BOARD MEMBER

Policy 1450
AGENDA ITEM:
Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.
