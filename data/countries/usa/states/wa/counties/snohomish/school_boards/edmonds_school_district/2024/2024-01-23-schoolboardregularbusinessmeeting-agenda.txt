Background:
All disbursements made by the district are by warrant or by imprest checking account and procurement cards which are
reimbursed by warrant. Before disbursements are made they are carefully checked for accuracy and proof that the
goods or services have been received, are satisfactory, and that previous payment has not been made. All vouchers for
payment of goods and contract services are approved by the auditing officer and then listed on voucher registers which
are presented to the board for approval at the next regular meeting. Board approval of district disbursements is
required by RCW 42.24.080. Vouchers audited and certified by the auditing office required by RCW 42.24.080, and
those expense reimbursement claims certified by RCW 42.24.090 have been recorded and the listing made available to
the Board.
Policy # 6215 states in part, "All claims for the provision of goods and services, other than payroll, must be pre-audited
and certified by the district's appointed auditing officer/designee. The form shall provide for the authentication and
certification by such auditing officer that the materials have been furnished, the services rendered, and that the claim is
a just, due and unpaid obligation. Warrants shall be approved by a recorded affirmative vote of a majority of the
board."

Information:
First Reading (No Action), Revised Board Policy 3110- Qualification of Attendance and Placement
Background:
We are proposing a change to the Early Entrance Policy 3110- Qualification of Attendance & Placement.
The current language says, An early entrance candidate for kindergarten or first grade is defined as a
child whose fifth birthday (kinder) or sixth birthday (first) falls between (and includes) September 1 and
December 31. We would like to change the end date from December 31st to October 31st.
The rationale for the change is that this would create congruence with neighboring districts and reduce
administrative costs. Only one student in 5 years of data who has had a birthday between 10/31 and 12
/31 has successfully tested in.
