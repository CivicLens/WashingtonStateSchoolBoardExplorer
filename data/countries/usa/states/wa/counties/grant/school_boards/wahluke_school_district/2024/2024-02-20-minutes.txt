    Information: G. Superintendent's Report
Andrew Harlow gave his Superintendent's report

Today’s TK-5 Reimagined “Why’s”
1.Not Accessing Our BEST Resource: Location, Proximity, Small Community
a. Why DIVIDE or SEPARATE our grade-level students into 3 different schools?
b. Most Districts would prefer to have everyone in the same building but simply can’t be achieved due to District size
c. WSD is only District in area to separate students using our current design
2. Remote Location = Limited Resources
a. WSD already has a challenge attracting & retaining high quality staff
b. Share resources between entire grade-level vs. dividing between 3 buildings
3. Equity between Grade-Levels:
a. Kinder student placement: Behavior, ELL, Teacher Kids, SPED
b. Access to resources & opportunities is “luck of the draw”
4. Strategic Plan:
a. Strengthen PLC’s across grade levels

Next Steps
January - June
February 5-21:
1.Continue working with TK-5 Reimagination Committee (FEB 7, FEB 21) + Principal Team
2.Letter sent to students & parents/guardians notifying them of WSD’s intent to reconfigure by grade-level in 2024-25
3.Superintendent meet with ME, SME & MSSE’s Parent-Teacher Organizations and Migrant PAC Night
