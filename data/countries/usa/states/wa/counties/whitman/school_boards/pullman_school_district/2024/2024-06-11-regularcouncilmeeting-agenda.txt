Public Content
All public transit agencies in the state must submit a six-year transit development plan
(TDP) annually to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). The
TDP is commonly paired with an agency's annual report, and serves as a measure of
how local transit systems are performing and what their future plans are. The
information becomes part of the WSDOT Public Transportation Division's annual
report, which is presented to the State Legislature and referenced during policy and
funding decisions. A condition of submittal is that the plan is presented and has the
opportunity for discussion in a public forum. Staff recommends that Council hold a

public hearing on June 25, 2024 to provide the City Council and community an
opportunity to consider Pullman Transit's TDP.

Recommended Action :

By motion, ratify Change Order No. 3 to Contract 23-10,
Pullman Downtown Improvements.

Public Content
The scope of contract 23-10, Pullman Downtown Improvements, consists of the
improvement of East Main Street between N. Grand Avenue and SE Spring Street,
including water/sewer/storm mains, full road and sidewalk construction, traffic and
pedestrian signal construction, landscaping, and street furniture.
Change Order No. 3 provides for the removal and replacement of the existing
concrete pavers within Pine Street Plaza with new concrete pavers from the Main
Street right-of-way to the north limits of the plaza, from building face to building face,
which equates to about 4,500 square feet. The Contractor proposed this solution in
lieu of salvaging and replacing the existing pavers within the project demolition limits
(about 2,400 square feet). The incremental price increase is being offset by the
deletion of other bid items, and will result in a better end product, at no additional cost
to the project. The new pavers will be installed in the original pattern as well.

Change Order No. 3 has been prepared and is attached to this staff report. Please
refer to the attached summary of work items for more detail on each of the items in
Change Order No. 3. The Public Works Director has approved and signed Change
Order No. 3 as authorized per Pullman City Code Section 1.107.140.
Staff are now seeking ratification by the City Council of Change Order No. 3.

owned land located at 125 SE Spring Street. A "Public Sidewalk Easement" was
necessary and asked of the property owner for the ongoing maintenance and public
access rights of these improvements. That easement has now been prepared and
executed by the property owner, BT Pullman, LLC at no cost to the public and is
offered for City Council acceptance. The easement will then be recorded with
Whitman County.

2025-2030, which were aggregated and summarized in the attached memo from
Community Development DirectorRJ Lott, Finance Director Jeff Elbracht, and City
AdministratorMike Urban, dated April 8, 2024.
On May 8, 2024, the CIP Committee met to consider various funding requests and
prepare a draft CIP for 2025-2030.
The members of this years committee are as follows:
Eric Fejeran, City Council Member
Pat Wright, City Council Member
Joe OCallaghan, Planning Commission Member
Angela Taylor, Planning Commission Member
Devon Felsted, Citizen-At-Large
On May 22, 2024, the Pullman Planning Commission met to review the CIP and the
Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) for 2025-2030. The Planning Commission
reviews and makes recommendations to the City Council on the proposed CIP
related to land use or the Comprehensive Plan. After discussing the draft CIP, the
Commission voted unanimously to find it consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
An updated schedule accompanies this years CIP/TIP. This allows the City to
accommodate betterthe reporting regulations and requirementsof the TIP to the State
of Washington. Within 30 days of adoption, the TIP must be filed with the State

Secretary of Transportation. The State of Washington requires that the TIP be filed by
July 1 each year. Looking ahead to the next CIP/TIP work cycle for 2026-2031, staff
intends to keep the same schedule as in 2024. This will help the City of Pullman
maintain a standardized process and keep within the mandatoryreporting
requirements.

City Staff submitted Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) project proposals for the years
2025-2030, which were aggregated and summarized in the attached memo from

Community Development DirectorRJ Lott, Finance Director Jeff Elbracht, and City
AdministratorMike Urban, dated April 8, 2024.
On May 8, 2024, the CIP Committee met to consider various funding requests and
prepare a draft CIP for 2025-2030.
The members of this years committee are as follows:
Eric Fejeran, City Council Member
Pat Wright, City Council Member
Joe OCallaghan, Planning Commission Member
Angela Taylor, Planning Commission Member
Devon Felsted, Citizen-At-Large
On May 22, 2024, the Pullman Planning Commission met to review the CIP and the
Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) for 2025-2030. The Planning Commission
reviews and recommends to the City Council the proposed CIP related to land use or
the Comprehensive Plan. After discussing the draft CIP, the Commission voted
unanimously to find it consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
An updated schedule accompanies this years CIP/TIP. This allows the City to
accommodate betterthe reporting regulations and requirementsof the TIP to the State
of Washington. Within 30 days of adoption, the TIP must be filed with the State
Secretary of Transportation. The State of Washington requires that the TIP be filed by
July 1 each year. Looking ahead to the next CIP/TIP work cycle for 2026-2031, staff
intends to keep the same schedule as in 2024. This will help the City of Pullman
maintain a standardized process and keep within the mandatoryreporting
requirements.
Staff recommends theMayor conduct the public hearing for the 2025-2030 Capital
Improvement Plan for the City of Pullman.

Master Plan.

Public Content
On March 19,staff solicited proposals from qualified consulting firmswith experience
and expertise in preparing a Parks, Recreation, and Open Space (PROS) Plan. The
PROS Plan document will update the Parks & Recreation Department's most recent
Comprehensive Five-Year Plan, which was adopted in February 2020. The document
must fulfill the planning eligibility requirements for park and recreation plans set by
the State of Washington Recreation & Conservation Office.
The purpose of the project is to produce an updated plan and provide guidance to the
City in its management and development of park properties and recreation programs
for the next twenty years. The PROS Plan will be based on the needs and values of

the citizens of Pullman and will include both six-year and twenty-year capital
improvements. The planning process will consist of public involvement in various
ways to educate and engage the community about the future of the park, recreation,
and community services. To prepare the PROS Plan, a public involvement process
will be used to gather opinions on needs and requirements from community
members, special advocate groups, and other stakeholders.
A comprehensive planning approach will be used to address the requirements of the
PROS Plan and deliver a living and working document that provides guidance for
both short-term and long-term goals in a financially sustainable and achievable
manner. Specific tasks to be used to develop the PROS Plan related to implementing
specific action itemsare: Open and Communicated Public Process (including no less
than four visits to Pullman); Statistically Valid Survey; Demographic & Recreation
Trend Analysis; Existing & Future Facilities - Analysis of Levels of Service; Rank &
Prioritize Demand and Opportunities; Analysis of Programs and Services; and Action
Plan & PROS Plan Development.
The full scope of work is attached as Exhibit A to the Professional Services
Agreement. The project is to be performed on a cost-reimbursable basis with a not-toexceed budget of $123,800. Funding for this project will come from the Parks General
Fund Budget and was included in the Citys 2024 Capital Improvement Program.
Work on the PROS Plan is expected to begin in 2024Q3 and is expected to be
completed in the Spring of 2025.

Slope Earthworks, LLC for the base bid amount of
$353,376.01.

Public Content
The scope of contract 23-05, Pullman City Cemetery Expansion 2024, consists of
clearing and grubbing approximately 2.4 acres of what is predominantly existing
farmland, stripping topsoil, stockpiling topsoil, grading subgrade, constructing new
gravel roadway, replacing topsoil, spreading compost and partial mixing into topsoil,
hydroseeding, installing erosion control blankets on steep slopes, and other incidental
work items necessary to create approximately 1.2 acres of new cemetery space that
will specifically accommodate future burial plots. The contract also includes, as an
additive option, installing a landscape irrigation system to serve the new cemetery
expansion area (additive #1). Refer to the attached project location exhibit.
Bids for this project were opened on May 30, 2024, with five proposals received. The
low bidder is East Slope Earthworks, LLC, with a base bid of $353,376.01 and an
additive #1 bid of $217,148.75. The Engineers Estimate for the base bid schedule
and additive #1 schedule is $324,836.19 and $174,798.00, respectively. A copy of the
bid summary is attached for reference.
Based on budgetary constraints, staff recommends awarding the contract to the low
bidder for only the base bid work. With this approach, the installation of a complete
landscape irrigation system can be implemented all at once or incrementally in
phases, as funding availability and demand for burial plots dictate.
Funds from the Cemetery Improvement Fund and the Cemetery Project Fund will
cover expenses for this construction project.

Onsite work is expected to occur this summer/fall and be substantially complete by
mid-November. The contract will not be accepted as physically complete and will
remain open beyond substantial completion until permanent site stabilization is
achieved.

Staff recommends approval to enter into a three-year
contract with Public Safety Insights, LLC (PSI) for the fire
departments' storage, usage, and deployment of their
Compact Rapid Deployables to protect emergency
responder communications during a large-scale emergency
when normal communication routes have been impacted.

Fire Department staff recommend approval of the three-year contract with PSI for the
storage, use, and deployment of their compact rapid deployable towers (CRD). CRD
units, also known as mini cell towers, augment ATT/FirstNets wireless broadband
network, which is exclusive to first responders. Fire Department staff, the Citys
Emergency Management, and Whitman County Emergency Management currently
carry FirstNet devices that connect to these units. This equipment would help ensure
communications are maintained between emergency responders should the in-place
networks fail from man-made or natural disasters.
As part of the contract, the CRD units would also be available to the greater region.
Outside agencies could make a request to FirstNet for these units to be deployed to
their emerging incident, and fire department staff would be responsible for the
transportation and deployment of each unit. Members from the fire department will
deliver the unit within a 4-hour radius of Pullman. Once operational, fire department
members will return home. Expenses such as travel, wages, benefits, per diem, and
hotels are reimbursable through PSI. The reimbursement model is similar to the
Washington State All-Hazard Mobilization plan. The city would be made whole for all
expenses related to the deployment of the CRD. The fire department would store one
to two units, and they would be available for our local use at any time at instances
such as WSU Football games, Lentil Festival, or on the 4th of July.
The CRD units are ideal for our location and will secure communications for decisionmakers during an emergency.
Each unit can fit into the back of a pickup truck or mount to a standard receiver on
most vehicles.

Public Content
One of the goals established by the City Council was to research and discuss the
implementation of an ordinance regarding vacant buildings. Staff presented to the
City Council on September 13, 2022, and March 28, 2023, initial findings and asked
for further direction on the goal. On March 28, 2023, a presentation was given to the
City Council on vacant buildings. A video of that presentation can be found at the 34:
40 mark here:2023-03-28 Pullman City Council Meeting (youtube.com).
Since there are three members of the City Council who took office after these
previous discussions, city staff felt it prudent to revisit some of the past discussions to
ensure that a potential path forward was in line with the current board.
The City of Pullman does currently have a nuisance ordinance addressing vacant
buildings from 2007 (5.01.050(22)) that reads: All vacant, unused, or unoccupied
buildings and structures within the City, which are allowed to become or remain open
to the entrance by unauthorized persons or the general public, because of broken
glass, missing, or open windows, or other openings, so that the same may be used
by vagrants or other persons detrimentalto the health and welfare of the inhabitants of
the City.
