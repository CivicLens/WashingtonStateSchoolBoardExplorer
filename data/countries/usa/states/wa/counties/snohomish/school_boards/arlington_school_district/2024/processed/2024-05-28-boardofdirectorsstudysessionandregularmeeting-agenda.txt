Public Content
Submitted by:

Brian Lewis, Executive Director of Operations
Background Information:

Between 2018 and 2024, Arlington Public Schools has proposed several bonds to construct a replacement building for Post Middle School.
Each time, the proposed bond has not achieved the 60% voter approval to be considered passed. District administrators are presenting an
alternative to bonds to support the construction of a new Post. The proposed alternative is a capital levy question on the November 2024
general election ballot.
Administrative Considerations:

Documents attached to this agenda item are:
Draft Capital Levy Resolution 5.5.24-The draft resolution describes how the district determines the
need for a replacement school building, describes needed funding to support construction of a new
building, and shows the annual estimated rate per $1,000 of assessed valuation, as well as the
annual collection amount associated with the levy.
Presentation to Board re Post Capital Levy Proposal 5.5.24 - a powerpoint presentation describing
aspects to be included in the consideration of a capital levy for the construction of a replacement
Post Middle School building.
Budgetary Impact:
None associated with this discussion. If the board does decide to place a capital levy on the ballot, election costs will have to be paid for by
the district following the election.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:

An election calendar is included in the presentation attached to this agenda item.

Student Achievement Leadership Award. Kerri is an avid advocate for removing barriers and increasing access to learning and achievement
for all students. Through her leadership, the board, district leaders, and instructional staff are disaggregating and analyzing data at a deeper
level and identifying gaps and barriers to learning for our students. She has been instrumental in securing more support in the areas of
mental health, behavior, attendance, and discipline through county grants. In addition, she facilitates and supports our District Community
Equity Team, Student Advisory Council, Counselors, and our School Equity Facilitators.
Thank you, Kerri! You are an amazing leader and Arlington is so fortunate to have you!

commitment and leadership for helping the community understand the scope and need of three important ballot measures in February 2024.
Kimberly and John can be best described as passionate champions and cheerleaders for Arlington Schools. With their amazing leadership
and relentless dedication, two of the three measures presented to voters were approved.
Thank you, Kimberly and John!
Student Leadership Award:
Sera Sabol
Rationale: Arlington Public Schools is pleased to honor Sera Sabol for our WASA Student Leadership Award. Sera has been attending
Edmonds College as a Running Start student the past two years while serving faithfully on both our District Community Equity Team and

Rachael is an advocate for making things better for Arlington students, but specifically at her high school, Weston. She is keenly aware of
the needs of her classmates and actively seeks solutions.
One example of Rachaels advocacy is her drive for better food choices at her high school. She collected data, secured supporting images of
food portions, and presented her concerns to SAC and district nutritional leaders. As a result, inspired by her advocacy, solutions and
actions have taken place including the addition of a vending machine with meals that can be accessed throughout the day at her high
school.
Rachael provides valuable student perspective and leadership as a member of SAC. She engages with other school staff, students, and
community members to discuss important issues that students are facing every day.
Rachael is a vibrant student advocate and leader.

Meeting :

May 28, 2024 - Board of Directors Study Session and
Regular Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the Budget and Enrollment
Reports as presented.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
April Budget Reports:

Fund balance and net cash: The beginning fund balance for the 2023-24 year was $3.8 million. As of the end of April 2024, the fund balance
was $2.8 million (compared to $7 million last April 2023) and net cash is approximately $5.1 million (compared to $7 million last April 2023).
These balances have temporarily increased from the previous month due to the large influx/collection of county tax dollars which is typical
for April. While it is consistent with the normal pattern at this time of year, it is at a significantly lower balance across this fiscal year than in
prior years. Consistent with prior year trends, fund balance, net cash, and revenues show a large spike in October and April from receipt of a
large portion of local property taxes. The months following these large influxes show declines especially since the state apportionment
allocation in November and May is only 5%, and June is only 6% of the total allocation versus 9% in most of the other months. Expenditures
remain at a fairly consistent monthly level. A short-term temporary interfund loan from the Capital Projects was not necessary for the months
of January, February, or March. A short-term temporary interfund loan from Capital Projects will be proposed for approval by board
resolution as it is certain to be needed for the month of June. June is the lowest point in the year for fund balance. Current projections
estimate that the district will have an ending fund balance of between $1 million and $2 million (depending on the Safety Net grant award for
special education costs) for the 2023-24 fiscal year.
Local Tax Revenue: The district has received 90.87% of total budgeted General Fund tax revenues for the 2023-24 fiscal year. Tax
revenues received year-to-date amount to $8.7 million of the $9.6 million budgeted.
State Apportionment Revenues: The district's State Apportionment allocation is increased since actual average full-time equivalent (FTE)
enrollment is approximately 113 more than budgeted enrollment. In November, the District requested OSPI to adjust the enrollment figure
used to disburse the District's monthly allocation, to a level that would more closely align with the increase in enrollment that the district was
experiencing. This allowed the district to receive needed revenues earlier and supported cash flow levels for November and December. The
amount of the increase becomes more evident with January's apportionment which is when the State makes its annual 'true-up' on its
payments to school districts. January is when the state adjusts from paying school districts based on budgeted average student FTE to
payments based on ACTUAL average student FTE. The remaining increase in apportionment is than spread from January to August. The
overall increase in revenues for additional enrollment is estimated to be between $1-1.3 million dollars.
May Enrollment Report:
The May 2024 enrollment reports are submitted for Board review and approval. Actual enrollment for May 2024 was 5,405.95 FTE (FullTime-Equivalent). May enrollment decreased 17.39 FTE compared to April's enrollment. The average FTE taking into consideration
September through May monthly enrollments is 5,427.78. This is 113.78 FTE more than budgeted enrollment of 5,314.00.
Compared to 2022-23 average enrollment, the district is serving approximately 65 more student FTE in 2023-24 than the year before.
Previous Board Action:
Board acceptance of Budget Reports for March 2024 occurred at the April 22, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.
April enrollment was approved by the Board during the April 22, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.

Submitted by:
Brian Lewis, Executive Director of Operations
Background Information:
In its 2019 session, the Washington State Legislature mandated all K-12 public schools in Washington State institute a Threat Assessment
protocol and implement it by September 2020. The Educational Service District 189 (ESD 189)created a Threat Assessment Consortium in
2018 to assist school districtsin the development of protocols and practices to meet this mandate.Arlington Public Schools joined the
consortium in November 2019.The attached contract is a renewal of the consortium agreement for the 2024-25 school year.ESD 189 staff
supported the conduct of six threat assessment processes in the 2019-20 school year, two in the 2020-21 school year, and 13 in the 202122 school year,28 in the 2022-2023 school year, and 33 to datein the 2023-24 school year.
Administrative Considerations:
Arlington Public Schools has a threat assessment structure in place, including policies, and is prepared to respond to the need for a student
threat assessment.ESD 189 provides support with the conduct of Level 1 and Level 2 assessments as needed and coordinates training for
administrative staff who may participate in a threat assessment process.
Budgetary Impact:
The proposed support agreement costs for the 2024-25 school year is $9,092.00. The 2023-24 school year consortium cost was $9,006.11.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:
Consortium agreement renewal is requested to occur prior to the beginning of the 2024-2025 school year. This allows Arlington
staff to participate in training activities by consortium staff prior to or near the beginning of the school year start.

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves Resolution 24-07
Interfund Loan.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
The District has been carefully tracking cash flow. Projections indicate a cash shortfall is anticipated for the month of June. The District is
requesting an interfund loan so that current obligations for June and potentially part of July can be met.WAC 392-123-140 allows for a
temporary interfund loan from the Capital Projects Fund to the General Fund, provided the loan does not interfere with the operation of the
Capital Projects Fund and that the General Fund pays the amount of interest to the Capital Projects Fund that it would have earned had it
remained invested with the County. The recommended loan authorization amount is $2,800,000, to be used to operate during the month of
June and potentially into the month of July since apportionment funding relief will not be received until the end of the month. Meanwhile
accounts payable warrants will be issued mid-month. The District plans to transfer only that which is required to meet the current cash flow
for June and possibly into part of July, as needed, to minimize interest costs. Cumulative amounts will not exceed $2,800,000. The loan
balance should be paid in full by the end of August 2024. Monthly financial reports will specify actual outstanding interfund loans and actual
interest charges involved.
Administrative Considerations:

Per WAC laws 392-123-135 through 160, and the State Accounting Manual for School Districts, interfund loans from the Capital Projects
Fund are authorized when approved by resolution by the school board of directors. An interfund loan is considered to be a temporary loan of
moneys between one district fund and another. As a temporary loan, it is to be completely liquidated in less than one year from the date of
issuance. Loans shall not be made from any fund where there would be a detriment of any function or project for that fund. Moneys loaned
should only include money that is not currently needed by the loaning fund. Interest must be paid by the borrowing fund to the loaning fund
at a rate not less than the warrant interest rate used by the Snohomish County Treasurer's Office in calculating investment interest for the
District. The resolution adopted by the board should state the amount of the loan, the funds involved, the source of repayment, and the
interest rate involved.
Budgetary Impact:
Interest must be paid by the borrowing fund to the loaning fund. The interest rate to be used is the rate the Snohomish County Treasurer
uses for the District's investments during the periods/months of the loan.The estimated loan interest to be paid to the Capital Projects Fund
could be approximately $12,252.60 (For example, using April's interest rate of 5.324% APR, generates approximately $408.42 per day. If the
entire $2.8 million were utilized for 30 days, the cost would be $12,252.60. This amount may change depending on the County's actual
interest rate during the period as applied to the part of the $2.8 million that may be outstanding, and the actual payback date(s).
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:
The interfund loan must be authorized by Board Resolution prior to making the loan.

Regular Meeting

Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves Resolution 24-04 Capital Levy
to Construct a New Post Middle School as presented.

Goals :

Goal 1: Student Learning & Achievement
Goal 2: Safe and Caring Environment
Goal 3: Resource Stewardship
Goal 4: Voices and Partnerships

Public Content
Submitted by:

Brian Lewis, Executive Director of Operations
Background Information:
Since 2018, The district has requested approval from voters to issue school bonds to fund the construction of a replacement for Post Middle
School. Election results have ranged from 52% yes to 56% yes in five separate elections. Bonds require a super majority yes vote of 60% to
be considered approved. Alternatively, capital levies require a 50% plus one voter approval to be considered approved. Capital levies can be
used to fund new school construction. There are several considerations to keep in mind regarding the use of capital levies to fund new
school construction.
Administrative Considerations:

The attached resolution, if approved by the board, would request the Snohomish County Auditor to place
a question on the November 5, 2024 general election ballot. The question asks voters to approve a
capital levy to support the construction of a new middle school to replace Post Middle School. The new

school would be on the same site as the current Post Middle School. The levy would also support
improvements to the site to include a travel lane for school buses serving all schools located on the
campus, a new athletics field and track, and other improvements like parking serving all schools on the
campus. Students would attend the existing Post Middle School until the replacement school is complete.
Also included as an attachment to this agenda item are presentation materials, which describe:
Election Review
Funding Post Middle School with a Capital Levy
Timeline comparison
State Construction Assistance Program Changes
Levy projections
Levy comparisons
Annual Levy Collection Amounts
Election Calendar
Budgetary Impact:

If the resolution is approved, the district would be responsible to pay for election costs associated with the
November 5, 2024 election. Election cost estimates are estimated at less than $20,000 paid from the
2024-2025 district budget.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:

Resolutions calling for an election in November 2024 must be approved by August 6, 2024 to qualify for
the November 2024 ballot.
