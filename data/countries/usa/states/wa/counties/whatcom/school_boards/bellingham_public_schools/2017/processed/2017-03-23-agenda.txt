2.3 Award contract for Bellingham High School turf
field project

Meeting :

Mar 23, 2017 - Regular Board Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

As outlined below, board approval is requested to award the
Base Bid for the Bellingham High School Turf Field to
Premier Field Development, Inc.. As Superintendent, I have
reviewed this request and fully support the selection of
Premier Field Development, Inc., for this project.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director of Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
On March 14, 2017 we were pleased to receive bids from four contractors for the construction of the new synthetic turf field at
Bellingham High School.The four contractors are: A-1 Landscaping and Construction, Inc.; Hellas Construction, Inc.; Premier

Field Development, Inc.; and RAM Construction General Contractors, LLC.
The lowest responsive and responsible bidder as noted in the attached bid tabulation is Premier Field Development, Inc., an outstanding
turf field construction company that recently completed our Squalicum High School field project. Premier also has an

impressive list of other references including the University of Washington, Seattle Seahawks and
Western Washington University.D.A. Hogan, our project architect, has worked on numerous projects with
Premier Field Development and highly recommends them.
After consulting with legal counsel, we have determined that the bid from Hellas Construction, Inc. is non-responsive as

they listed themselves as the electrical subcontractor on the bid form, work they were not licensed to
perform at the time they submitted their bid. As such, we are precluded from awarding them the bid as
doing so would be in violation of state law. Hellas Construction acknowledged in an email that listing
themselves to perform the electrical work was a mistake and that they intended to list a separate
subcontractor.
Board approval is requested to award the Base Bid for the Bellingham High School Turf Field to Premier Field Development, Inc., the
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. There were no project alternates.
The attached bid tabulation lists all of the bidders and their respective bid prices.

Explanation of Issue:

In June 2010 the Board adopted Policy 6800 in order for the district to comply with state regulations pertaining to the Asset Preservation
Program (APP). We must comply with APP in order to be eligible for state construction assistance funding for future school
modernization projects.
One of the specific requirements associated with APP is that on or before April 1 of each year, the Board will receive an annual report
pertaining to the condition of the districts facilities that were built after December 31, 1993, and for which the district received state
construction funding assistance. The affected facilities in our district are Birchwood Elementary School, Fairhaven, Kulshan, and
Shuksan middle schools; and Bellingham and Squalicum high schools. Happy Valley Elementary School will be included in the 2018
report but does not need to be included this year even though it meets the APP criteria.
The attacheddocument is the 2017 building assessment report prescribed by OSPI. The Condition Rating is a summary rating taking
into consideration the condition of all major systems at each school including foundations, walls, roofs, windows, doors, electrical,
plumbing, heating, etc. All of these ratings exceed the OSPI Building Condition Standards.
