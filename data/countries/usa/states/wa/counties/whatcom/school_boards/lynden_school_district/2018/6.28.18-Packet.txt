Report prepared by: Patti Fairbanks, Director of Finance and Operations

Packet page 12 of 36

Lynden School District
Summary of Financial Status as of May 31, 2018
General Fund
Revenues – We are fast approaching the end of the year and our revenues are on track for
where we should be at this point. As of May we have collected 75.7% of our budgeted
revenues for the year and we are 75% through the year.
Expenditures – As we approach the end of the year we have spent 72.3% of our budget as of
May. While the students are leaving for the summer, we will still have some larger
expenses pending related to summer school, maintenance projects, and our quarterly
payments for certain services (like Running Start).
Fund Balance – May fund balance is $4 million and 10.04% of budgeted operating
expenditures. We typically see our low point for fund balance each year in June as we
receive one of the smaller percentage of Apportionment.
Capital Projects Fund
Revenue activity consisted of interest earnings and state reimbursement on our construction
projects.
Expenditures were related to the construction projects.
Debt Service Fund
Revenue activity consisted of property tax collections and investment earnings.

ASB Fund
Our ASB fund balance is $286,000 for May, which is an increase of approximately $71,000
from last year at this time. May revenues were $32,500 less than expenditures in May due to
yearbook expenses, FFA supplies and athletic expenses at the high school.
Transportation Vehicle Fund
Activity includes interest earnings.

ACTION

Water Lines at Fisher and LMS

INFORMATION

Background Information:
A provision of final occupancy at both Fisher and LMS is the conveyance of the water line and
an easement agreement with the City of Lynden to maintain the water line.
This has been in the lawyer’s hands for a while. My understanding is that the legal
description, a bill of sale based on the cost of the work, and a description of the line that is
being conveyed has held up the final documents.
In layman’s terms the City of Lynden will own the water lines and in order to conduct
maintenance on the lines we are granting an easement across our property and over the line
itself, so when something does go wrong the City can get in there and take care of it.
I expect to have the final documents by early next week and will forward them to you for
review before the meeting.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: No Recommendation at this time

Exchange Agreement with City of Lynden

INFORMATION

Background Information:
The lawyers are working to finalize the exchange agreement with the City of Lynden for land
intended to be used to extend the City Trail and the old water tower land and road that runs
between Judson Hall and the Gym.
I have asked the City to conduct soil samples to check for contamination when they remove
the cement foundation for the old towers. They will coordinate this with Geotest. There is a
provision in the agreement that allows 30 days to consider issues such as soil testing and
provides time for us to conduct more tests if we feel it is necessary. If Contamination is
discovered, we can back out of the agreement.
Because the lawyers are still working on the language details I will not have the agreement in
hand until Wednesday. I will forward it along to you when I receive it.
This has been a long process in finalizing but I am hopeful it can be considered at this
meeting. If for some reason it is not complete and ready for your consideration it will get
pushed back until our meeting in July.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: No Recommendation at this time

Resolution 08-18

INFORMATION

Background Information:
We are continuing to work on compensation for 2018-19 contracts with teachers and admin.
Because the administrator contracts for 2018-19 go into effect on July 1st there needs to be a
mechanism for increasing salary if the raise is beyond 3.1%.
Negotiations across the state have taken longer as we are working to figure out how to
address the increase in state funding for salaries and the decrease in levy funds. Determining
a sustainable budget for the next 3-4 years until we get to a balance in funding requires a
slower look and certainty that what ever we do is appropriate to the increase while
considering the decrease.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: I recommend approval of resolution 08-18

Report prepared by Jim Frey, Superintendent

Packet page 25 of 36

LYNDEN SCHOOL DISTRICT
BOARD OF DIRECTORS RESOLUTION NO. 08-18

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors annually sets the salary schedule for the next school year
for unrepresented building administrators and district directors on or before July 1 of each year; and
WHEREAS, before determining whether to adjust the salary schedule compensation for said
unrepresented personnel for the year beginning July 1, the Board desires to review:
•
•
•
•

The level of revenue the District is projected to receive from all sources in 2018-19;
The results of salary surveys and other compensation related planning and other information
from comparable in-state school districts;
The level of allocations in the state budget that are earmarked for members of District
bargaining units and the outcome of any negotiations with such bargaining units; and
Salary compression that may have been created as a result of any such increases or allocations.
WHEREAS, all such information will not be available on or before July 1;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that:

1. ADOPTION OF TENTATIVE SALARY SCHEDULE
The Tentative 2018-19 Salary Schedule is subject to further adjustment on or after July 1, 2018 because
the Board desires to consider additional information, such as listed above, that is not yet available
before deciding whether to grant adjustments to salary or other forms of compensation to such
personnel, which if adopted, will be effective as of July 1, 2018.
2. TOTAL COMPENSATION NOT SETTLED OR LIQUIDATED
The salary, compensation or benefits amounts for such personnel are not settled or liquidated as of July

2018-19 Meetings and Committees

Background Information:
This is provided as an FYI.
A couple of items for consideration are the WSSDA Conference in November and identifying
Board retreats.
In past years we have not attended the WSSDA Conference when it is held in Spokane. Does
the Board want to attend as a group or send a few members as a representative team? If
there is interest in going, we will need to make plans.
I believe it is a good thing to identify a few retreat days on the calendar to set aside some
dedicated time to review priorities, establish goals, and develop plans. In past years we have
done this in November about the same time as the WSSDA Conference. I would suggest we
also look at a spring date to set aside as well.
Committees structure is summarized as well and the Board should discuss if there is any
interest in modifying membership for the upcoming year.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: No Action Required
