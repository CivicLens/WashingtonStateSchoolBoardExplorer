B. 1st Reading Policy 1400 Revision
Meeting Conduct, Order of Business and Quorum
Superintendent Travis Hanson presented a revision to Policy 1400, Meeting Conduct, Order of
Business and Quorum, for board consideration. This policy was adopted on March 26, 2007 and
last revised on November 13, 2023.
To accurately reflect current practice, the presented revision states Regular Board Meetings will
be held once each month, on a Monday, beginning at 6 pm. Reference to meetings taking place
on the second Monday of each month is removed. The presented revision additionally includes
new language stating that the board meeting calendar will be established in June for the
upcoming year (July – June) with dates posted on the district website.
This was the first reading of a policy revision. No action was taken.
Noting no first reading changes were recommended, President Cannon indicated this policy
revision can be brought forward as an action item at the next Regular Board Meeting.

C. Student Travel Proposal
Mead High School Band & Color Guard
Jeff Naslund, Director of Secondary Education, presented for board consideration a request from
Mead High School Band & Color Guard (approximately 104 students), Band Director Rob Lewis,
along with Brandon Campbell (Mead High School Marching Band Instructor) and additional adult
chaperones sufficient to provide a 7-9:1 adult-to-student ratio, to travel to Etiwanda, California,
November 1-4, 2024, to take part in the Band of America Marching Band Competition. This
trip/competition will take the place of a regional, out-of-town competition the group typically
participates in that falls on Homecoming Weekend. As is the typical practice for all Marching
Band competitions involving an overnight stay, school gym space has been reserved for lodging.
Friday, November 1st and Monday, November 4th are travel days, the competition takes place on
Saturday, November 2nd, with Sunday, November 3rd being a sightseeing/activity day. Students
will miss two days of school.
The estimated per student cost is $524 with funds available via fundraising and the Bandwagon
Booster Club to assist HB 1660 students and others needing financial assistance. Students will
not be responsible for any advisor or chaperone expenses.
Director Killman liked the fact that the adult-to-student ratio is lower than the minimum
standard set forth in the district’s student travel procedure and President Cannon noted the
travel proposal was thorough and well put together.
Director Nolan made a motion to approve the trip from Mead High School Band & Color Guard
to travel to Etiwanda, California, November 1-4, 2024, to take part in the Band of America
Marching Band Competition, as presented. Director Killman seconded the motion. The motion
carried unanimously.
D. Student Travel Proposal

Jeff Naslund, Director of Secondary Education, presented for board consideration a request from
Mt. Spokane High School music students (approximately 200), plus teaching staff and adult
chaperones sufficient to provide an 8-10:1 adult-to-student ratio, to travel to Anaheim,
California, April 3-8, 2025, to participate in the WorldStrides International Music Festival. During
the course of this trip students will have the opportunity to participate in a variety of music
performances/competitions organized by WorldStrides. An Itinerary Overview was included in
the travel proposal.
The estimated per student cost is $1,658 with funds available via fundraising and the Mt.
Spokane Bandstand booster organization to assist HB 1660 students and others needing
financial assistance. Students will not be responsible for any advisor or chaperone expenses.
Students will miss two days of school.
President Cannon, issuing a friendly challenge to Mt. Spokane, noted Mead High School recently
attended this same festival and did very well in the various competitions associated with the
event.
Director Gray made a motion to approve the trip from the Mt. Spokane High School Music
Department to travel to Anaheim, California, April 3-8, 2025, to participate in the WorldStrides
International Music Festival, as presented. Director Nolan seconded the motion. The motion
carried unanimously.

E. Student Travel Proposal

Mead High School Cheerleaders (approximately 17 students), Cheer Advisor Katherine Melka,
plus three additional chaperones, to travel to Orlando, Florida, February 4-10, 2025, to

placed second in their category at USA Spirit Nationals.
The estimated per student cost is $2,400 with several fundraising opportunities available for
those needing assistance. Students will miss four days of school.
Director Nolan made a motion to approve the trip from Mead High School Cheerleaders to travel
to Orlando, Florida, February 4-10, 2025, to participate in the 2025 National High School

carried unanimously.
VII.

Reports
A.
Financial Report for the Months of May & June 2024
Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson presented a brief financial report for the months of
May and June 2024. The district’s ending enrollment (June 1st) for the 2023/2024 school year
was 10,137.59 FTE. Budgeted enrollment was 10,210.00. Average monthly FTE enrollment was
10,130. While under budget, enrollment throughout the year was more stable than in the
previous two school years. An enrollment graph illustrating year-to-year trends was shared by
Ms. Ellingson who noted this chart will be prepared and shared annually. While hoping
enrollment will stabilize in the 2024/2025 school year, Ms. Ellingson noted post-pandemic
enrollment continues to be difficult to predict.
While overall enrollment continues to be under budget, Special Education enrollment has grown
throughout the year. Enrollment started at 1580 and grew throughout the year to 1800. Prepandemic Special Education expenses were in the 12.5% range (below the state’s spending cap).
The district ended 2023/2024 at 16%, higher than the 15% cap. Next year the cap increases to
16% and the district expects to exceed this spending cap for the entire year. Ms. Ellingson shared
that there are many things that factor into why Special Education enrollment continues to
increase. The district does not accept out-of-district special education students.
Cash flow is currently better than anticipated, although Ms. Ellingson reminded it will decrease
in July with the purchase/payment of a new Nutrition Services freezer and Chromebooks.
It is anticipated the district will end the year with a Fund Balance of $9 million (restricted &
unrestricted). This is better than projected with the district only using $3.5 million out of Fund
Balance in 2023/2024, not the anticipated $5.5 million.
B.
2024/2025 Draft Budget
Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson, referring to the 2024/2025 Draft Budget Summary
document provided to each board member, noted the budget, taking into account known
expenditures and known revenue, was prepared with the primary goal of maintaining the
district’s current education program. Ms. Ellingson noted the board spent considerable time this
past spring discussing the 2024/2025 budget.
2024/2025 budgeted FTE enrollment is 9,872. This is considerably less than where the district
ended the 2023/2024 school year (10,137 FTE). Kindergarten enrollment is currently less than
hoped for and, therefore, enrollment projections were adjusted downward to assure the district
is not overstaffed. Special Education enrollment, as shared during the May/June Financial Report,
is 16%, 4% higher than the pre-pandemic 12%.

The proposed 2024/2025 ASB, Capital Projects, Transportation Vehicle and Debt Service funds
were briefly reviewed. Regarding the Debt Service Fund, Ms. Ellingson noted there are 2015 bonds
that, in January, are eligible for refunding/refinancing with a potential savings to taxpayers of
$3 million. Therefore, upfront monies that will be needed should the district move forward with
refunding/refinancing have been included in the 2024/2025 Debt Service Fund budget. From the
Transportation Vehicle Fund the district plans to purchase two diesel and two electric buses.
In response to a question from Director Gray, Ms. Ellingson confirmed that, as discussed
throughout the spring, expenditures in the proposed 2024/2025 budget are projected to exceed
revenue by approximately $2 million. This is the “worst case scenario” with Ms. Ellingson noting
it is hoped enrollment will be higher than budgeted and that there will be other savings realized
throughout the year. President Cannon noted he would like to have further conversation on the
$2 million deficit and explore ways to proactively reduce this number.
The 2024/2025 budget will be brought to the board for official adoption on August 26, 2024.
Board members were encouraged to reach out to Ms. Ellingson prior to August 26th with any
questions. Although adjustments can be made after August 31st, the board must adopt the
2024/2025 budget prior to August 31st.
Superintendent Hanson shared Ms. Ellingson and Adina Grimsley (Business Services Director)
are in the process of updating the Citizen’s Guide to the Budget. Once updated this user friendly
document will be posted online.
C.
2024/2025 Facility Use Fees
On the subject of facility use fees for the upcoming year Ned Wendle, Director of Facilities &
Planning, shared it is his recommendation no changes be made from the current fee schedule.
While fees generated do not cover all expenses, affordable community access to district facilities
is important and aligns with earlier board direction to prioritize accessibility.
Mr. Wendle will prepare a cost breakdown for the board and, looking toward 2025/2026, bring
forward potential increases to help offset operating costs.
D.
WIAA Policy Advocacy Update/Discussion
Director Gray provided an update on a recent conversation with Paul Kautzman, GSL & District
8 Director, regarding support for female athletes. The deadline to submit a proposed amendment
to WIAA is October with amendments needing to be voted on by all WIAA districts. To be
considered, an amendment needs a lead school district and 5-6 other school districts must sign
on in support.
Director Nolan added, regarding protection of women in sports, that he would like high school
athletic directors to provide clarification on certain sections of the WIAA handbook. Director
Killman wondered if the addition by WIAA of an “open” competition category would accomplish
the desired outcome. Director Nolan additionally noted there have been changes to Title 9 and,
to help understand the impact of these changes, requested Student & Family Services Director
Josh Westermann update the board on this topic.
President Cannon suggested, as a next step, the board meet with legal counsel before proceeding
with any formal action on this topic. This could then be followed by further board conversation
about the amendment process prior to the October submission deadline.
E.
Superintendent’s Report
Superintendent Hanson shared the following:

1. Meetings with the entire district Admin Team, in preparation for the upcoming school
year, will begin the week of August 5th.
2. Echoing comments made by Director Gray, Superintendent Hanson commended the
incredible hands-on learning that takes place at the various summer STEM camps put on
by the district’s CTE Department.
3. Superintendent Hanson noted that while summer is a time off for teachers and students,
it is a very busy time for many district employees including maintenance, custodians,
technology and District Office staff. In particular he noted the sewer work taking place at
Meadow Ridge, the annual summer deep cleaning of all school buildings and the
configuring of newly purchased Chromebooks. He expressed his appreciation for all of
the work that has taken place, and will continue to take place, this summer.
4. Noting there have been several recent district and school administrative changes,
Superintendent Hanson shared he will invite those individuals to the upcoming August
board meeting for introduction.
5. Regarding technology, Superintendent Hanson shared high school classrooms, like
already in place at middle schools and elementary schools, will be cell phone free next
year. He shared this is “the right thing to do” and noted the need for teachers and parents
to partner with the district on this new policy. In a recent Healthy Youth Survey 50% of
10th graders shared they believe their internet and screen time use is a problem. A twoweek “soft” roll-out is planned and additional details regarding confiscation and return
of phones are being finalized. The district has reached out to other districts who already
have a similar cell phone policy in place to learn what, from an implementation
standpoint, has and has not worked well for them.
Director Gray thanked Superintendent Hanson, Business & Operations Assistant
Superintendent Jared Hoadley and the district’s Technology Committee for their work on
this new policy noting she believes it will be well received.
In response to a question from Director Killman, Superintendent Hanson confirmed
universal language regarding cell phones will be included in both high school student
handbooks.
VIII. Remarks for the Good of the Schools – Public Comment on Non-Agenda Items
Ed Magill, Laura Ketcham and Lynda Berg collectively expressed concern regarding Special
Education para-educator staffing at Mead High School. They shared many individuals have left
and that DLC will have three new teachers next year They are fearful, if the school year starts
with 8-9 unfilled para positions, that they will be walking into chaos. Each of them loves the
students they work with. Their purpose in addressing the board is to make sure “someone”
knows about the situation.
IX.
Adjourn
The meeting was adjourned at 7:45 pm.
