  Minutes
    1. Regular Board Meeting

The March board meeting location was changed to the District Office due to the COVID-19 state of emergency.
President Gibson called the meeting to order at 7:00 p.m.
All Directors were in attendance.
     Todd Nunamaker, Dougal Thomas, Joan Lotze, Charles E Gibson, Laura McKinney
Directors Gibson and McKinney attended remotely via Zoom.
Directors Nunamaker, Lotze, and Thomas attended in person.
Telephonic audio of the meeting was provided in the building lobby to accommodate the limitations in place for social gatherings. However, no visitors were in attendance.
  B. Pledge of Allegiance
President Gibson led in the Pledge of Allegiance.
  C. Board Comments on the Agenda
Director Lotze asked for clarification regarding the Northwood Alliance Church warrant formerly in Action Items on the agenda, but now included with other warrants in Financial Matters on the Consent Agenda. It was explained that the church's warrant no longer needs to be separated from other warrants now that Charles Gibson has retired from his position as pastor.
  2. Public Comment
A. Public Comments
There were no members of the public in attendance.
  3. Reports
A. School Administrator Reports
There were no school administrator reports at this meeting.
  B. Enrollment Update
Executive Director of Finance and Operations Amber Porter reported on enrollment for the month of March which may be the last count for the current school year if schools do not reopen. The grand total for March was 2,220.56 FTE. Ms. Porter explained how OSPI may use that count to generate monthly enrollment figures for the remainder of the current school year based upon past trends. Using that model, the year would end with an estimated enrollment level of 2,218.85 FTE which is about 9 FTE above the budgeted level of 2,209.76 FTE.

Director Thomas thanked Ms. Porter for providing clarification to him in response to his question at the February 24 meeting regarding the high level of 6th grade students currently in the HomeConnection ALE program. That high level appears to be an anomaly this year.
  C. Budget Status and Financial Report
Amber Porter provided a review of revenue and expenses for the month of February. While expenses are trending in a typical manner, it is uncertain what revenue will look like in the coming months. The state will continue to wrestle with revenue challenges, and there have been no indications that education funding would be reduced. However, the district should prepare for the possibility of funding cuts. Later in this meeting, the board will take action on directing the superintendent to prepare a reduced education plan for 2020-2021 in case staffing reductions are ultimately needed. The plan, however, may not end up being enacted if it is not needed. The district has been assured that apportionment revenue will continue as normal for the current school year, but no specifics have been provided for future revenue. Ms. Porter explained that there are several funding sources (e.g. LAP) which are typically lost when not used. Uncertainty related to property tax revenue was also addressed. Director McKinney asked about the collection of revenue from the district's recently approved bond, and Ms. Porter provided an explanation of the timelines for current voter-approved bond and levy revenue. Changes in the district's overall tax revenue are not anticipated, although extension of the tax collection deadline will impact the district's receipt of that revenue and could have an effect on bond payments which are due December 1st.
  D. Superintendent's Report
Currently, students are scheduled to return to school on April 27, and the year would end on June 19, with remaining missed days waived due to the pandemic state of emergency. Graduation will remain scheduled on Monday, June 8, but plans may be impacted by any remaining limitation on social gatherings.

This week, principals sent out emails to families with access to optional, non-graded, enrichment activities for students. These types of activities will be released on a weekly basis. Starting next week, printed activity packets will be made available to hand out along with meal deliveries. Staff members also started working on professional development plans this week. There was discussion regarding the possibility of providing mobile hot spots or internet access from parking lots. The provision of nutritional services has been going well with approximately 700 meals served on March 20 and 673 served on March 23. Today, the governor announced a 2-week stay at home order, but schools are still required to provide meals as well as child care for health care and emergency response workers. The district is working with the labor unions to address concerns related to working during the stay at home order. Although it seems very possible that schools could remain closed for the rest of this year, the district is continuing to plan based upon a return date of April 27. Dr. Granger provided a status update on the plan for child care which will include efforts to keep family units separate from each other. Nurses will also check everyone's temperature before they enter the building. He also described the possibility of SEIU hourly employees being able to address some campus cleanup projects that have been difficult to get done when school is in session.

A meeting is scheduled with Field Turf on April 2nd, and plans have been on track for the project to begin on April 6th.
  Later in this meeting, the board will take action to adopt updates to graduation policies. Dr. Granger reminded the board that detailed requirements have been moved out of the policy document and into the procedure in order to streamline the implementation of new rules as needed.
  In preparation for the 2020-2021 school year, efficiencies in staffing are been addressed in order to best meet the needs of students. The district anticipates meeting the May 15 deadline for offering 2020-2021 contracts to teachers.

Although the WASA Superintendent Conference was canceled, the board's next regular meeting will still take place on April 20. Since that date falls within the school closure timeline, the meeting will again be conducted with social distancing protocols in place.

The legislative session has now ended, but the governor may call an emergency session related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Granger provided a brief update on the following public education topics represented in current legislative bills:
SB6189 - Governor Inslee has signed this bill, providing continued SEBB eligibility through remainder of year for school employees impacted by school or childcare closures or quarantine.
HB2965 - SBE will meet later this week to grant temporary flexibility in graduation requirements to ensure that seniors who are on track to graduate will be able to do so despite school closures.
HB2739 - Allows shared leave to be used for employees impacted by the need for isolation or quarantine.
SB5395 - Comprehensive Sex Education — Preliminary reports indicate that Blaine's current FLASH curriculum will continue to be acceptable under this new law.
SB6117 - Increases the SPED appropriation multiplier for 80% or more in the general education classroom.
A limited amount of educational funding matters were also approved, including:
0.5 FTE for counselor in high poverty elementary
$1.9 million for safety net increase
Paraeducator Training — Additional two days
After March 24, most district staff members will be working from home. The office will be closed to the public and contact information will be posted on the doors.

Dr. Granger pointed out a typographical error in the Personnel Matters item on the Consent Agenda. The list of Classified SEIU personnel matters appears in the Classified Non-Represented section.
