Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulg√°b).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time
immemorial and their ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice
the traditional ways of their ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural
traditions passed on to them by their ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these
lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its
Indigenous people, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history,
and can demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.

Goal 1: Student Learning & Achievement

Public Content
Submitted by:

Brian Long. Director of College and Career Readiness
Background Information:

The 2024-2025 articulation agreement with Everett Community College (EvCC) aims to allow high school
students to earn college credit by meeting established competencies in designated Career and Technical
Education (CTE) courses. Students who achieve the required knowledge, skills, and competencies with a
minimum grade of C (2.0) and receive teacher endorsement will be eligible for EvCC credits, supporting
smoother transitions to post-secondary education and career pathways.
Administrative Considerations:

The agreement requires coordination between Arlington Public Schools and EvCC faculty to ensure
course alignment and verify competencies. The administrative team will oversee the endorsement
process and maintain records of student progress to facilitate credit transfer.
Budgetary Impact:

Arlington Public Schools will experience minimal direct budgetary impact, as this articulation agreement
primarily involves administrative coordination and course alignment activities within existing staffing and
resource allocations.
