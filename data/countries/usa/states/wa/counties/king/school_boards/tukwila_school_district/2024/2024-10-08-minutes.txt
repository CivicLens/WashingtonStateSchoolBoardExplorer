  A. WSSDA Legislative Top 10
  Director Larson shared an update on WSSDA's General Assembly meeting. This is a meeting where we vote on different positions that we are going to take as an organization.  The next step is for each district to vote on its top 10  legislative issues.  There are approximately 120 various positions and the deadline for submitting our top 10 positions is today.  Director Larson shared his recommendations for our top 10 positions.  The main focus of the top 10 focuses on funding.  If there are no changes, Director Larson will submit this list to WSSDA.

We haven't been above 90% in years. Director Larson requested additional College Bound Scholarship data, to include information broken down by race and gender.  
  Dr. Pedroza shared that we have the AVID program at the high school and middle school. 
  Director Larson commented on Ninth Grade on Track to Graduation On-Time.  He would like data on what students are failing, which courses or programs, etc.  Principal Parker shared that they are implementing grading for equity at Foster High School.  
  Dr. Pedroza shared that High School and Beyond Planning is a priority in our Strategic Plan. It is important for students to understand that this is a journey, not a destination.  
  Director Larson requested that Running Start is added to the Future Educator Program and include a participation goal along with data.   
  Director Larson shared that last year TSD collaborated with the City of Tukwila regarding the distribution of Chromebooks to 132 Foster High School students.  He asked what are we seeing as to the impacts of that program.  The program was to provide high-quality internet access outside of school and have it available at the student's home.  Principal Parker shared that due to relocation, some of the laptops were lost.  Director Larson asked is the district responsible for the replacement costs.  Dr. Pedroza commented that when we have the I.T. report, we can include information on this project.

In collaboration with the YMCA, we focus on student advocacy, helping students understand how to use their voice and get involved in local government and beyond. We help them create a bill.  In May, when the legislators are out on vacation, we spend a week in Olympia.  We tour the facilities and have the students sit in the seats of the Senate and House of Representatives to "argue" their bill.  Students from all over the state of Washington attend and argue their bills amongst each other.   This year we plan on taking 12 youth.
