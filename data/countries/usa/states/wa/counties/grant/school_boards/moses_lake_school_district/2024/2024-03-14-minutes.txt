  7. New Business
Presentation: A. 4b-Students share their voices and actively engage within their school communities
Triscia Hochstatter shared "student voice" is an important indicator and there are different types of student voice. Statistics show those who believe they have a voice will be more motivated.
The Center for Educational Effectiveness (CEE) data shows that students feel they are involved in making decisions in the school and that adults help them plan and set goals for the future.
The CEE staff data shows that students are encouraged to self-reflect and track progress toward goals.
Finally, the CEE family data indicates that families feel their student is learning about the cultures of the community at their school. Families also say, adults in the schools value and respect their racial/cultural identity.
Ms. Hochstatter went on to identify the importance of student engagement in the school community and how it enhances social skills, increases academic achievement, improves self-esteem and confidence, and has quite a few other positive effects on students.
Students enhance our community through community involvement in clubs, athletics, supporting others in their volunteering roles, etc.

Action: B. Policy 2415 Performance-Based Pathway for High School Graduation
Ron Mayberry, CTE Director, gave a brief summary of Policy 2415, Performance-Based Pathway for High School Graduation.
Mr. Mayberry noted graduation pathways consist of several things. ASVAB is one pathway by showing their readiness for graduation. Another way is through CTE pathways. The state has developed a more customized way of meeting those pathways in ELA or Math. They have outlined a protocol of what would be done in schools and the procedure side of how to create the pathways.
This is a brand new policy and MLSD is looking to have it adopted.
Mr. Hill asked if this is a work based credit, but Mr. Mayberry noted he would call it a project oriented approach to creating a pathway that is more connected to something outside of the traditional CTE pathways.
Mr. Mayberry stated there are very detailed frameworks and rubrics around this way of meeting high school graduation pathways.
This will be placed on the agenda for the second reading at the March 28, 2024 meeting.

Action: C. Policy 6700 Nutrition, Health and Physical Fitness
Jeremy O'Neil presented essential Policy 6700 Nutrition, Health and Physical Education. Our food services program in general is tied to having these policies in place.
CEP is the program MLSD has benefited from, as it affords all students in MLSD a free breakfast and lunch at this time. This program is very significant assistance for our kids.
We are updating our current policy to align with the model policy.
  Move to approve Policy 6700 as presented.
  Motion by Paul Hill, second by Kevin Fuhr.

Information, Presentation: E. CTE Presentation
Ron Mayberry gave a Career and Technical Educational presentation describing its history and the many courses it encompasses.
Mr. Mayberry noted the courses that are being considered for implementation in the 24-25 school year have gone through a process. Approval from the general advisory committee was received. Building of frameworks for these courses are being built and will be submitted no later than April 15th. Once they are approved, we will be able to officially draw in additional funding attached to CTE to help with extra consumables and small equipment and maintenance on the equipment for those courses.
MLSD is also looking to expand work-site learning and officially be able to claim much of that funding. Those courses will also need to be approved and have frameworks submitted.
Goal 5 of the Strategic Plan--Readiness for college, career and life can be met through CTE.
  Action, Discussion: F. Resolution 2024-04 WSSDA Prioritization of Local Control and No Unfunded Mandates
Mr. Hill noted this resolution comes from the governing body, WSSDA. 225 positions are being reviewed at this time.
This resolution is actually a bylaw change for WSSDA. We hope to change the bylaws and any legislation or lobbying WSSDA does would have to support local control.  The resolution would also keep them from supporting any unfunded mandates.
If passed, this will go to the WSSDA Bylaw Committee and then on to a vote at the General Assembly.
  Move to approve Resolution 2024-04 WSSDA Prioritization of Local Control and No Unfunded Mandates.
