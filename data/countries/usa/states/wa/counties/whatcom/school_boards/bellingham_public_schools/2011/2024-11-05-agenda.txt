Explanation of Issue:
As we discussed previously, we have identified a 17-acre parcel of land for a potential school site in the north end of the district.
Various due diligence activities have been completed and indicate the site is appropriate for a school setting. The proposed
agreement contains provisions that reflect the parameters you have established.
By approving the Purchase and Sale Agreement, you are authorizing the Superintendent to execute all necessary documents to
complete the purchase of this parcel.
Funding for this proposed purchase comes from investment earnings and surplus funds in the Districts Capital Projects Fund
dating back to 2000 or before and not from any funds associated with our $67 million 2006 Bond Issue.
I recommend your approval of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.

FROM:Janae Hodge, Assistant Principal, Shuksan Middle School
DATE:September 30, 2011

Subject: Student Overnight Trip to Washington State Prevention Summit
I am requesting approval to take a group of students along with Ms. Linda Du Bois, our new Prevention/Intervention specialist
and Ms. Isabel Meaker, our Latino Family Coordinator, to the Washington State Prevention Summit in Yakima, WA the dates of
October 27-29, 2011. This opportunity would be both motivational and educational. The experience would provide our students
and chaperons with an enriching and culturally competent training and networking opportunity focused on working toward
prevention of substance abuse, violence and other destructive behaviors. The goal of the Summit is to reach the continuum of
highly experienced youth and adults from diverse backgrounds to those that are new in the field, and continue to build on our
foundation of success in Washington State.
We believe that this trip would also be a positive, life-changing experience for our students.Furthermore, students will work in a
team to create prevention activities to implement at school upon their return. The Summit activities begin at 7:00pm Thursday,
October 27. If approved, we would leave early in the afternoon of Thursday, October 27. There is no school on Friday, October
28. We will return the afternoon of Saturday, October 29. In total students would miss less than one half day of school.
We are very fortunate to receive grant funds that cover the Prevention Summits costs in their entirety. The grant is through
Whatcom Prevention Coalition. There are no costs for students or adults and no student will be denied the opportunity for this
trip due to financial hardship. Transportation will be provided by a 15 passenger van, loaned to Whatcom Family Community
Network, from Christ the King Church. We will take turns driving and all drivers have district form 2320 F-4 on file at Shuksan.
There would also be a limited amount of free time for our students on this trip, and we would involve as many adults as possible
to ensure safety. In addition to the three representatives from Shuksan Middle School listed above, two adults from Whatcom
Family Community Network, Mr. Geof Morgan and Ms. Amy Hockenberry will also accompany our group. We have secured
chaperones at a rate of 1 per 3 students.
Thank you for your attention to our request.
