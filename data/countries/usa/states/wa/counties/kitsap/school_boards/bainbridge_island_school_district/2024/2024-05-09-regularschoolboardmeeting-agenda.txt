Re: Spring 2024 School Board School Updates
_________________________________________
Earlier this fall, the decision was made to not have each school publicly present their School Improvement Plan in light
of so much emotion and confusion related to possible school closure and consolidation facing our community. Now

that we are no longer considering school closure or consolidation, and instead are back on track with the great work
happening in schools, each of our seven BISD schoolswill attend a board meeting this spring to highlight the amazing
experiences of their students and steadfast dedication and tremendous talent of their staff.

Re:Certificated Staffing Reduction in Force (RIF) Reporting Requirements
________________________________________________________________
By state law, district administration is required to notify the Board of Directors of any certificated staff RIFs (Reduction in Force)
by May 15th of each school year.
I am pleased to report that we do not have any RIFs that will occur in the 2024-25 school year. Instead, we have been intentional
about which positions will be refilled due to attrition, and have reallocated FTE when possible to better meet student needs while
still being conscious of the budgetary impact.
At our May 9th Board meeting, CFO Kim Knight and I will present our current budget forecast, as well as certificated and
administrative staffing planning for the 2024-25 school year.

Re: Rotary Auction Bus Shuttle Board Approval

The Rotary Club of Bainbridge Island has requested the rental of school buses from the Bainbridge Island School District to
provide shuttle service for the annual Rotary Auction on July 6, 2024.
RCW 28A.160.040 states, The directors are authorized to lease school buses to nonprofit organizations to transport children with
disabilities and elderly persons to and from the site of activities or programs deemed beneficial to such persons by such
organizations: PROVIDED, that commercial bus transportation is not reasonably available for such purposes.
At this time, there is no other commercial bus transportation that is reasonably available for this event. To ensure safe transit
between designated parking lots and Woodward Middle School, shuttle service is essential, especially for the elderly and young
children with disabilities. The Rotary Club of Bainbridge Island is a nonprofit organization that, in part, benefits the elderly and
children with disabilities. Thus, the requirements of RCW 28A.160.040 have been met.
Rotary requests (3) 40 ft. buses, operating on a shuttle route, traveling between 5 designated Park & Ride locations: Bethany
Lutheran Church, Ordway Elementary, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Bainbridge First Baptist Church, and Island
Church.
Buses will pick up rotary volunteers at Bethany Lutheran at 6:00 am and continue travel between these points on a continuing
basis from 7:00 am until the last pick-up/drop-off at 2:30 pm.
The cost is $72.75/hour (Overtime at 1.5) plus mileage @ $2.25/mile. These costs will be paid in full by The Rotary Club of
Bainbridge Island.
I recommend that the School Board approve the rental of Bainbridge Island School District buses on July 6, 2024, to provide
shuttle service for the annual Rotary Auction.
