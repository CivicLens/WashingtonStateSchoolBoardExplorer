The La Conner School Board held a special study meeting on March 11, 2024, where various topics including student attendance, extracurricular activities, and curriculum engagement were discussed. The board highlighted significant absenteeism issues among students, particularly in morning classes, and proposed potential solutions such as incentives for perfect attendance and the option for students to attend classes via Zoom. Additionally, the board addressed requests for more extracurricular activities and academic support, including the establishment of study halls. 

The board also reviewed multiple policies, with a specific focus on Policy 1450, which is proposed to be revised to reduce the number of consecutive meeting absences required for board members from four to three. Concerns regarding school safety and bullying were raised, along with a request to reintroduce security personnel on campus. The meeting emphasized community engagement, particularly in understanding why families choose to transfer their students out of the district, with 55 to 60 students reported to have done so. The board plans to follow up with families to gather more insights.
