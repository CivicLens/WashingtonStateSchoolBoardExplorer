Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Public Content
Recommendation:
Approve estimated expenditures for the 2024-25 Open Doors Re-engagement Program with Spokane Falls Community College
(SFCC) and Northeast Washington Educational Service District No. 101 (NEWESD) as specified below.

Background:
The Spokane County Open Doors Re-engagement Program focuses on older youth who have become disengaged with
traditional education programs and are not likely to become re-engaged through re-enrollment in a traditional or an alternative
high school. The program provides for educational and case management services to youth ages 16-21 who have dropped out
of school or are not expected to graduate by the age of 21. The educational component provides academic instruction, including
GED preparation, academic skills, college and work readiness and/or high school credit for a diploma. The case management
services include counseling, resource and referral services. The district retains five percent of the state funding per student
attending these programs with ninety-five percent being passed onto the college or NEWESD to cover instruction, student
support, and other program costs. This program has two pathways as described below.

Gateway to College Program with SFCC - Estimated cost $294,847
The high school diploma pathway is through the Gateway to College program at SFCC. Not only are students working on their
diploma, but they are taking college classes and learning how to be college students.Gateway to College aims to build on the
students successes, learn from their challenges, and create a tailored academic support program for selected participants.

NEWESD Estimated cost $664,656
The GED pathway is located at the Next Generation Zone. This program centers on building college and work readiness skills as
well as vocational exploration. These programs, including the GED classroom, have been together in one location since 2007
with much success.

Recommendation:
Approve Amendment No. 1 to the agreement with Communities in Schools of Spokane County in the amount of $315,579.64.
Background:
This amendment extends the terms of the agreement with Communities in Schools of Spokane County for an additional year,
through August 31,2025. The agreement outlines the responsibilities, fiscal agent, qualification, and partner obligations as
required by the 21st Century Community Learning Center (CCLC) which provides instruction for out-of-school time academic and

for Education Solutions (EES) Agreement Accessing
Organization for Education Technology and Curriculum
(OETC) Contract No. OETC-22B-Microsoft

Meeting :

Nov 6, 2024 - Regular Meeting

Category :

6. CONSENT AGENDA

Type :

Public Content
Recommendation:
Approve issuance of a purchase order to OETC, Sherwood, OR, in the estimated amount of $626,741.85 for the renewal of the
Microsoft Enrollment for Education Solutions (EES) Agreement for 12 months.

Background:
This recommended purchase renews enrollment in the Microsoft Education Solutions Software Program. The district has been
using the Microsoft EES platform for many years andit has worked well. The district saves significantly by enrolling in the EES
program. The difference in this purchasing model is that the district pays an annual fee to Microsoft rather than purchasing the
software with each computer. This program allows the district to install any Microsoft operating system and any Microsoft Office
product on district computers.In addition tothe anticipated cost savings, the consistency in operating systems and the Office
Suite across the computers in the district willallow for more efficiency in instruction and document collaboration. Consistency also
allows better technical support to end users across the district.
This recommended purchase is for the period of December 1, 2024 through November 30, 2025 accessing OETC Contract No.
OETC-22B-Microsoft. The pricing for this purchase is considered fair and reasonable and is a general fund expenditure.

Public Content
Recommendation:
Approve the issuance of purchase order to Lakeshore Learning Materials, Carson, CA in the amount of $230,030.90 for prekindergarten outdoor play equipment.
Background:
As the district expands PreK and establishes a 4-year-old program in each of the elementary schools, it was determined through
an annual review with Washington Department of Children Youth and Family (DCYF) that the district's current big toy
playgrounds are not age-appropriate or safety rated for preschool students. This recommended purchase will put
developmentally and age-appropriate outdoor gross motor play equipment at all district elementary sites to support the districts
preschool students.
In keeping with the bid law, RCW 28A.335.190, Omnia Partners Contract No. R230301 resulted from a competitive bid that was
awarded to the low responsive and responsible bidder. The recommended purchase will be funded by state DCYF ECEAP
dollars.
