Five district citizens elected by district voters serve four-year terms as members of the Board of Directors for Mount Vernon Public Schools. Their authority and responsibilities are established by the Washington state legislature. They act under the direction and restrictions of state law. Collectively, a school board is responsible for establishing the mission and goals of the district, for hiring a school district superintendent, for establishing policy, and for ensuring that district tax revenue is spent legally and in the most efficient manner possible to meet the district's educational mission. School boards hold regularly scheduled, advertised meetings to conduct school district business in public. The board authorizes all of its actions by majority vote. Individual school board members have no individual authority. The Mount Vernon School Board is committed to model the leadership expected at every level of the district. We will follow learning community practices, believing better decisions will result from our individual commitment to learn and understand varying perspectives as we work to build consensus.
