Public Content
Heres our thoughts on why they are deserving:
We would like to nominate the CHS Cheer team for the Mill Town Award because they go above and
beyond in everything they do and help establish a positive climate and culture in our building. They work
hard, give back to the community throughout the entire year (not just during their season), and support
our athletics, school, and community whenever asked (which is a lot). In fact, they are always ready to
perform/support/cheer/help whenever needed: Stuff the Bus, assemblies, celebrating our teams when we
send them off to compete at state, setting up/cleaning up at various events at CHS and MANY Camasrelated events such as our boosters fundraisers and with our DCA. These girls put on several cheer
camps to help inspire and lead the next group of girls coming in to continue the tradition of cheering and
being good role models! Whether its being a mentor to our youngsters in our community, or going up to
Tacoma for a week to support our basketball teams, this group is committed to making a difference at
CHS and in the Camas community.

The board values public input. The responsibility of the board is to listen and reflect on public comments
actively. The board may only discuss and act upon items included in the written agenda. For that reason,
board members cannot respond to any comments or questions during public comment but can ask the
Superintendent to follow up on issues raised during public testimony.
Guidelines for public input emphasize the respect and consideration of others. Boisterous conduct will not
be permitted at any meeting of the Board of Directors, nor will any harassing or threatening remarks be
tolerated. Complaints about individual employees should be directed to the superintendent's office as a
personnel matter. The board requests that anyone who has submitted written public comments refrain
from reading them during this portion of our meeting to allow other community members to share their
comments.
Each person providing public comment will have a total of 3 minutes. Once called upon, please step up to
the podium, face the board, and state your name for the record. The bell will ring at 3 minutes to remind
you that your time is up.
