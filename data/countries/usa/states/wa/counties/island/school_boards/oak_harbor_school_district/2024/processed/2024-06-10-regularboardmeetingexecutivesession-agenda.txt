Public Content
Oak Harbor Public School recruits teachers with academic majors in the subjects they teach. However, changes by the Office of
Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) and the Professional Educator Standards Board (PESB) have increased the
complexity of certification compliance. The factors that have increased our number of teachers requiring Borad approval to teach
out of their endorsement are as follows:
Co-teaching model with special education paired with general education teachers
Alignment with State Course Codes
Complexstate endorsementrequirements
OHI Math/Science and English Language Arts/Social Studiesassignments
Regardless of these requirements, the teachers on the attached list are proficient in the subject areas assigned as determinedvia
annual evaluations.
