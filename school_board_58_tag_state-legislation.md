Human Resources Director Keri Hutchins highlighted the expansion of hiring options for paraeducators and confirmed that all current paraeducators meet the job requirements.

Superintendent Travis Hanson emphasized the importance of community feedback and the necessity of a sustainable budget. The discussion also included the Special Event Trips policy (Policy 2152), which limits high school band trips to once every four years.
