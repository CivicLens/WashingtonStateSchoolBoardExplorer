Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Approve Resolution No. 2381 to increase the workers
compensation insurance revolving fund to $70,000.

Public Content
RECOMMENDATION
The district currently has a weekly limit of $40,000 in a revolving fund for Workers Compensation/Labor
and Industries (L&I) claims. The district is self-insured, and uses a third-party administrator, Eberle

Vivian, to make weekly payments for indemnity and medical benefits and expenses from this account.
The last time the revolving fund was increased was in 1999.
Workers Compensation costs have increased over the last several years leading to the rise in the
average weekly payments. Below is the average weekly payments made by Eberle Vivian for the last two
full school years and this school year:
2021-2022 $17,723
2022-2023 $27,761
2023-current $31,845
When needed payments exceed the limit, the Accounting team must quickly add money to the account to
prevent it from being overdrawn and ensure payments can be made as soon as possible.
Our third-party administrator, along with Risk Management and Accounting have reviewed the weekly
expenses and recommend that the revolving fund be increased from $40,000 to $70,000 to
accommodate our expenses.
RECOMMENDATION
The Board of Directors approves Resolution No. 2381 to increase the workers compensation insurance
revolving fund to $70,000.
