Excerpt from community message posted 04/16/24:
As shared in budget presentations before spring break and at prior board meetings, the district is facing
another year of significant budget constraints that will necessitate difficult decisions regarding program
reductions and potential reductions in force. Our preliminary shortfall is estimated to be $1.3 million and
requires us to consider decisions that go much deeper than we've ever gone before and are in direct
conflict with the goals of our strategic plan and what we know is best for kids. While these decisions are
not easy, they are essential to ensuring the long-term financial sustainability of our district.
However difficult, every effort is being made right now to prioritize the well-being of our students, staff,
and families throughout this process. We are continuing to work collaboratively to explore all possible
avenues for minimizing the impact on our educational programs and preserving jobs to the greatest
extent possible.

We will continue to look at places where we can reduce through resignations or retirements. For
example, due to low enrollment, we will be reducing one classroom teacher at Chautauqua. However, we
also have a Chautauqua retirement so the reduction of one classroom teacher will not result in the loss of
employment for a staff member.
A 2024-2025 program reduction plan will be shared with the board at this Thursday's board meeting.
Given staff resignations, retirements, seniority, and endorsements, some of the identified program
reductions may not result in actual loss of employment. After more analysis this week and early next
week, any actual reductions in force or loss of employment will be shared at the board meeting on April
25th. By law, instructional certificated reductions must be approved by the board before May 15th.
After April 25th, we'll continue to review revenues and staffing for the final 2024-2025 budget that will be
presented to the board at their May 23rd meeting. As I write this, OSPI has just released their revenue
tool that will provide more clarity regarding revenues and will assist us as we prepare for the May 23rd
meeting. If we find additional capacity, we'll begin to restore programming that was initially identified in
the reduction plan and communicate it as soon as possible.
