Brian Lewis, Executive Director of Operations
Background Information:
In February 2020, Arlington School District voters approved a four-year capital levy to fund a wide range of capital improvements to the
district's school facilities. One of these projects is improvements of building envelope at Pioneer Elementary to prolong the useful life of the
building. The scope of work includes the following and applies to the school building and other structures on the site:
*Removing and replacing existing roofing materials with new roofing and making roof decking repairs as needed.
*Remove and replace siding and trim materials as needed.
*Repair defective downspouts.
*Remove and replace defective vinyl clad windows.
*Remove and replace building gutters.
*Clean and repaint all wood or composite building siding, trim, and exposed structural steel components.
*Apply sealant and anti-graffiti coating to concrete masonry unit walls.
The project team performed a competitive bid process which resulted in 4 bids being submitted on April 9, 2024. The architect's cost
estimate was $1,800,000. The lowest responsive bid was $1,351,050 submitted by Woodridge Construction LLC. Contingent on board
approval, the work is scheduled to begin on June 17, 2024 and will be substantially complete by August 30, 2024.
Administrative Considerations:
Attached are the following documents:
2010.520 ASD - PIONEER ES ENV IMP - BID SET.PDF: a representative architectural drawing showing describing the project and
showing its location on the site.
Pioneer ES Envelope Improvements - Div 00 - 09 - Combined: the specifications for the contracted work.
Arlington SD Pioneer ES Envelope Improv 4-16-24: a contract for the work between the school district and Woodridge Construction
LLC.
PIO Envelope Contractor Recommendation Letter 4.11.24 - A letter from McGranahan Architects describing its recommendation to
move forward with the Woodridge Construction LLC bid for the project.
PIO Envelope Improvements Proposal to Board 4.16.24 - A presentation describing the proposed project.
Budgetary Impact:
$1,351,050 plus Washington State Sales Tax from the Capital Projects Fund. The fund holds sufficient resources to meet the requirements
of the contract.

Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:
Approval at the April 16 meeting allows sufficient time for the contract to acquire components for installation and prepare to begin work in
June.

B. Reduced Educational Program for 2024-25 DRAFT

Meeting :

Meeting

Type :

Discussion, Information

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Dr. Chrys Sweeting, Superintendent; and
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:

The district does not have assured financial resources to maintain its program and services at the present
levels for the 2024-25 fiscal year. It is necessary to make reductions in the district's educational program
for the 2024-25 fiscal year in order to maintain a level of expenditures within reasonably anticipated
resources.
Many school districts across Washington State are experiencing similar challenges either in the prior year, the current fiscal year or will be
making adjustments in the next fiscal years due to similar situations as what the district is experiencing. The primary issues which are
contributing to the need for making reductions include, a) inflation which is not only causing higher costs for goods and services but also for
staffing costs that are increasing with the anticipated cost-of-living increases and negotiated salary increases across multiple labor groups;
b) exhaustion of pandemic induced federal and state aid which were non-recurring funds; c) enrollment declines that have not recovered to
pre-pandemic levels; d) maintenance of higher staffing levels during and directly after the pandemic as schools were directly tasked with
mitigating impacts of the pandemic and taking measures to accelerate student learning; e) use of one-time excess fund balance and
minimum reserves during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 fiscal year; f) and the State's funding model that continues to lead to funding gaps.

Specific to the State's funding model, challenges include declining regionalization, and continued state underfunding of the true costs of
education (special education, and staffing costs outside the prototypical school funding model).
Previous presentations to the Board about financial highlights of the current budget have continually indicated that future year forecasts
signal a need to make reductions by a minimum of $2.5 million dollars. Projections and estimates for 2024-2025 revenues and expenditures
are continually being compiled and updated under changing circumstances. Decisions must be made at this juncture so that appropriate
preparations can be made with the goal of achieving an appropriately balanced budget for the next fiscal year. With the uncertainty of these
matters in mind, the present range of potential reduction could fall between $2.5 and $3.5 million.
The Budget Advisory Task Force (BATF) was formed near the beginning of the 2022-23 fiscal year and has continued to meet during the
2023-24 fiscal year. Input was sought from members comprised of community, staff, parents, and students, which has informed the decision
making process both for nearly $5.9 million in budget reductions made for the 2023-2024 fiscal year and has continued around an additional
$2.5+million being planned for the 2024-25 budget. The district has developed and will present a DRAFT Resolution for a Reduced
Educational Program and a DRAFT plan for approximately $2.8 million worth of cost savings, reductions, or increased revenues. The Board
may discuss and comment on the proposed DRAFT plan. The Resolution and Plan may be further refined, after input from the Board, and
will be brought to the April 22 board meeting for consideration of adoption.

Budgetary Impact:
$2.5+ Million
Sensitivity of Board Approval:
State law requires that certificated employees must be notified in writing of non-renewal of their
employment contract on or before May 15.RCW 28A.405.210andRCW 28A.405.220.
Approval of a reduced educational program resolution by the April 22, 2024 board meeting facilitates the
process by helping ensure that employees affected by said plan may be timely notified prior to the May
15 deadline.

District Calendar.

Public Content
Submitted by:
Dr. ChrysSweeting, Superintendent

Background Information:
Due to lost instructional hours and one day lost resulting from inclement weather throughout this school year, revisions to this year's district
calendar are needed.

State law requires that school districts provide a minimum of 180 school days (unless a waiver is approved) and a district-wide average of
1,027 instructional hours per school year. In order to meet these state requirements, we are proposing the following changes to this year's
calendar:
Instead of the last day of school being held on Friday, June 14, the last school day will now be held on Monday, June 17, 2024.

4/16/24 Revised Calendar was updated to denote June 14th as an early release day. DM
