2025-2030 Capital Improvement Program (CIP)
Video Detection Program – Streets Fund

DATE:

May 13, 2024

While presenting at the CIP/TIP Committee meeting on Wednesday, May 8, 2024,
staff discovered that an existing and ongoing CIP project was inadvertently
omitted in the final submitted documents delivered on April 8, 2024. I sincerely
apologize for this inadvertent oversight. Please refer to the CIP/TIP Committee
Minutes for more background information.
The project is for Video Detection Program, and the Project Description sheet is
included with this memo. Certain traffic signals in Pullman have inductive loops in
and under the pavement surface that detect approaching vehicles. Those loops
are easily damaged over time, making repairs difficult and costly, and can be
disrupted by snow and ice conditions. This ongoing program aims to replace those
loops with video detection equipment, mounted on the signal mast arms. This
equipment is not damaged as frequently, and is more adaptable to changing
conditions at the intersections, such as lane reconfigurations due to construction
or work zone activities.
Staff recommends that this project be appended to the CIP/TIP recommendations
for 2025-2030.

Justification, continued.
By upgrading the vehicle detection equipment at selected intersections, we can achieve several benefits. First, it
will make repairs easier, as there will be no need to disturb the asphalt to replace the detection equipment. Second,
the upgraded vehicle detection equipment is more adaptable to changing conditions at the intersection, such as lane
reassignment due to construction or temporary lane closures for work zone activities.
