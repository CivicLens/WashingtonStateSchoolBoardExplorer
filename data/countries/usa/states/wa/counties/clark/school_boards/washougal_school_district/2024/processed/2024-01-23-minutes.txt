Superintendent Mary Templeton pointed out the thank yous, student artwork, and cake displayed in the board room
for School Board Appreciation. Mary told the board how much we care and know the amount of dedication,
commitment, and positivity they each bring to the role, and that's why they volunteer. Mary went on to say the board
is so engaged and visible, and that shows in the leadership they exhibit. Mary read the governor's proclamation.
B. Board Responsibility Overview
Angela Hancock pointed out the chain of command that the board should be following, which is not the day-to-day
operations of the district. The board can listen and then point people in the right direction. Superintendent Mary
Templeton highlighted that the district's organizational charts are available on the website.
C. Annual Board Policy Series 1000 Review
The board received and reviewed Policy Series 1000 for the 2023-24 school year.

D. Budget Survey & Staffing/Budget Update
Director of Business Services and Operations Kris Grindy and Director of Technology and Communications Les Brown
presented an update on the budget process to date and the initial results from the Community Budget Survey. Kris
reiterated the need for $3 million in reductions for the 2024-25 school year, and shared some additional information
including: this is being felt by all districts due to the funding mechanism used by the state, the state does not fully
fund basic education, declining enrollment, inflation, substitute costs not being updated in 10 years, and the $700,000
levy rollback due to the per-pupil cap (our lower enrollment doesn't allow the district to fully collect what the voters
approved). Kris shared what the district has done in 2023-24 to reduce costs, what some of the plans are for 202425, and shared that the board will hear more detail on February 13th. Les shared that around 600 people have
completed the survey, and some of the initial themes. The survey is open until February 8th.
