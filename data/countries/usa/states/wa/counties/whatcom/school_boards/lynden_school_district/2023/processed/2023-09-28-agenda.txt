The Lynden Alumni Association has selected Grant Brickbealer as the 2023 Lynden Alumni of the Year! Grant is a 2004 graduate
of Lynden High School and continues to be very involved with school activities within the community. This a well deserved
recognition and we are thrilled to honor him!
Our Kindergarten and Transition to Kindergarten programs are now up and running full time. Teachers and students are
settling into their new routines for the school year. We are serving 56 four and five year olds.
Lynden Academy's Leadership Class students identified a need to communicate directly with the Lynden Academy high school
students about school and district events. They proposed an Instagram page featuring LA activities and reposts of the LHS
events that LA students can participate in. With the help of staff, their first posts went up this week and they're looking
forward to participating in next week's homecoming activities.
Fisher Elementary coordinated with their PTA to purchase and install cement picnic tables with seats for the playground to
replace their failing "buddy bench". Students use this space to sit and read their book or talk with friends during recess, and
parents can use it to sit and watch their kids play on the playground during the weekends.
All schools have hosted Back to School Nights and had a great time welcoming families as they visited classrooms and
teachers!
The first session of the 23/24 Superintendent Series took place on September 18th. There were 10 community members who
attended the town hall style meeting which was focused on the district's strategic priorities.
Lynden Academy's K-5 students will visit Hovander Homestead Park for their first field trip of the year. They have plans to tour
Tennant Lake, participate in a fall scavenger hunt, and enjoy lunch together.
Invitations have been sent out to the community to serve on the newly created 23/24 Safety & Security Task Force. The
meetings will be focused on safe and secure learning environments for students and will be co-facilitated by Superintendent
VanderYacht, Lynden parent and former law enforcment officer Clark Bourgault, and Lynden parent and Lynden Police Officer
