Information:Approval of contract award to NAC Architecture for the design and construction
administration of College Place Elementary and College Place Middle Schools replacement. District
personnel have determined NAC Architecture to be the highest rated firm to provide architecture services
for this project.
Background:
The College Place Elementary and Middle Schools were identified in the 2024 Bond, passed by voters on
February 13, 2024. The District received ten submittals in response to an open Request for Qualifications
(RFQ) for this project. Based on the selection criteria described in the RFQ, District staff selected four
firms for further consideration. The Capital Projects Office staff held interviews on April 4, 2024, with four
qualified architecture firms.
The Selection Committee members, in alphabetical order, were as follows:
Laura Bowers, Manager Design & Construction, Edmonds School District
Carla Carrizosa, Principal College Place Elementary School, Edmonds School District
Nick Chou, Manager Design & Construction, Edmonds School District
Lisa Gonzalez, Executive Director, Student Learning
Victoria Page, Construction Coordinator, Edmonds School District
Taine Wilton, Director Capital Projects, Edmonds School District
The committees recommendation is based on qualifications and perceived best fit for this project.
During discussions the NAC team presented the most comprehensive and inclusive presentation and
were the most interactive with the committee team members regarding budget control methodology, and
their techniques for involving students, staff and community members.
While this is NACs first opportunity to work with the District, they have completed award winning
elementary and middle school designs for Districts across the Midwest and west coast including Seattle
and Spokane Public Schools.
If the Board of Directors authorizes award of the contract for this project, the District would execute the
attached agreement and issue a purchase order in the amount of $12,414,947 for Architectural Services.
This project, consisting of two schools, is funded by the 2024 Bond.
