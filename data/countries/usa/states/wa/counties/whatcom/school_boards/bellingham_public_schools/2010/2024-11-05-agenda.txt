To: Doug Kyles, Executive Director, School Administration
From: Mary Anne Stuckart, Elementary Principal
Re: 5th Grade Class Field Trip to NCI Mountain School
Date: October 8, 2010
Sunnyland Elementary is requesting permission from the Bellingham School Board to attend Mountain School with all of our fifth grade
students from March 28, 29 & 30 for Mr. Hostetlers classroom and March 30, 31, April 1, for Mrs. Gates and Mr. Steeles classroom.
The North Cascade Institutes Mountain School is a nationally recognized environmental education program, located in North Cascades
National Park.

Curriculum
This nationally recognized program and curriculum aligns well with the Washington State Fifth Grade Level Expectations in science and
literacy and is designed to enhance classroom learning. While at Mountain School, students spend the majority of their time outside, hiking on
trails and exploring mountain ecosystems first-hand through interdisciplinary activities. The curriculum of Mountain School includes
experiential, hands-on activities in science, math, language, music, art, social studies and conservation.
The North Cascade Institute requires that a teacher and three to six chaperones accompany each class. The staff at Mountain School provides
teachers with pre-trip lessons to help prepare students for Mountain School and post-trip surveys for students, chaperones, and teachers to
assess the experience and lessons. The Mountain School Teacher packet also includes parent information in English and Spanish, information
for chaperones, the daily schedules and information relating the activities to 5th grade GLEs.
Mr. Steele, Mr. Hostetler, Mrs. Gates and I believe that all Sunnyland students will benefit from the Mountain School experience. Many
students at Sunnyland have few opportunities to participate in outdoor environmental education and that this experience provides a valuable
opportunity for our many ELL students.

Instructors and Chaperones
North Cascades Institute education staff design lessons, provide leadership and train instructors at Mountain School. All instructors have CPR
and first aid certification. In addition, many instructors have Wilderness First Responder (WFR) training, an advanced 80-hour first aid
certification. Parents will serve as chaperones, participating in the learning activities as well as supervising the dorms along with the teachers.
They will be fingerprinted as per District Guidelines.

Costs

The full cost of the program is $300 per participant. Travel by school bus is estimated to be about $700. With scholarships and grant funds,
the North Cascades Institute provides a sliding scale for schools based on their poverty index. The cost for Sunnyland students is $140 per
participant including bussing. Weknow that some of the Sunnyland families will pay the full $140 and many of the families with pay a
smaller amount commensurate with free/reduced lunch prices. Plans include writing persuasive letters to the Sunnyland Community and local
businesses. The students will sell cases of peanuts as well as hold a fund raiser at the Park Lanes Bowling Alley with a car wash planned for
March. Due to our hard work last year, we currently have $ 2,464 for scholarships and an additional $500 in scholarships from the Sunnyland
PTA. We will continue to fundraise to provide scholarship support so that all Sunnyland fifth graders will be able to attend Mountain School.
No child will be excluded due to the costs associated with this learning experience. The classroom teacher attends at no charge. This is
Sunnylands first time to participate in Mountain School and everyone is looking forward to the adventure.

Communication With Families
We will be sending home a parent information packet and are holding a parent meeting on October 26, 2010. We will share the slideshow
created by the North Cascades Institute and review the packet. Pending School Board approval, parents will be asked to give written
permission using form 2320F-5. In the event that students do not attend the North Cascades Institutes Mountain School, a plan is in place to
offer an alternate placement.

Consent
Our adopted rules of Parliamentary Procedure, Robert's Rules, provide for a consent agenda listing

Explanation of Issue: Schematic Design Approval Whatcom Middle School
Earlier this month the Whatcom Middle School Design Advisory Committee met with the design team to review and provide their
input on the proposed schematic design for Whatcom Middle School. The Committee, Planning Principal Jeff Coulter, and
Committee Co-Chair Doug Kyles support presenting the schematic design to the Board for their consideration.
During the schematic design phase, the design team translates the educational specifications into graphic representations
including site and floor plans. Most of the site plan will remain the same as none of the building footprints will be altered.
However, one exciting change is to reactivate the historic 1903 entry into the new Commons area. Civil, structural, mechanical,
and electrical consultants provided information regarding codes, regulations, laws, and other requirements to the design team
which are applied to the schematic design. Several iterations of the schematic design are analyzed with regard to functional
validity, conceptual organization, as well as environmental and esthetic qualities. The end result is a set of schematic drawings
which incorporate as much of that information as possible. Those plans were presented to the Board earlier this evening in the
Whatcom Middle School Project Update Report.

The attached floor plans and elevation plan (Whatcom Schematic.pdf) represent the essence of the schematic design being
recommended to the Board for their consideration. Mr. Cowan and members of the design team will be pleased to answer any
questions not already addressed in the earlier report.
The schedule for this project remains as previously stated, with an anticipated opening in the fall of 2012, although the entire
team is working feverishly to accelerate the schedule.
I am recommending Board approval of the Schematic Design for Whatcom Middle School.
