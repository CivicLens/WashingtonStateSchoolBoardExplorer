Conferences
○

For conference day on the 25th the CJHS staff took a new approach by having students lead the
conversations at the conference. Students were provided time before the conference day to fill out
a document that showcased their grades, absences, tardies, supports, and prompts for sharing
what's going well and goals for the next quarter. The goal is to get students motivated in their
academic success and focusing on a plan to improve if needed. In the past we have focused more
on the problems and we want this to be a positive experience for both the student and family! We
will continue to evaluate and reflect as we work with our families in supporting their child's
learning experience at CJHS.

●

Spring Fling Dance (Can Food Drive)
○

CJHS will be hosting a spring fling dance on March 29th for our students at CJHS from 3:30 to 5pm.
Entrance to attend the dance will be 2 cans of food for each student. We will have extra cans of
food for students that are not able to acquire items for the dance. Students are looking forward to
the dance and it will be a great way to start SPRING BREAK!

●

PBIS Tier 3 Training
○

Mr. Flugel, Mrs. Martinez and our SPED team, Mrs. Bird and Mr. Clark are engaged in PBIS Tier 3
training during March and April. This training will support our students with the most significant
challenging behaviors. This assessment and intervention based support will create individualized
plans for our students who need the most support.

Nutrition
We are moving forward with the next steps on purchasing the Walk-In Freezer/Fridge combo units. We met with
principals and determined placement for the units and are waiting on some final paperwork to move forward with
those two purchases under the Action for Healthy Kids Healthy Meals Incentive Grant we were awarded.
We submitted the NSLP Equipment Grant application for a new dishwasher at the High School. We are looking at a
High Temp dishwasher to replace the current dishwasher that is broken, which will eliminate the use of sanitizing
chemicals decreasing our chemical costs.
The USDA Program of Local Foods in Schools provides Washington produced and processed foods free of charge to
schools while supplies last. Our district took advantage of this program and received about $16,000 worth of Local
Foods in Schools. Almost all the food has been used already since the program started, and all will be used by the
end of the school year.
Our Nutrition Services program is being showcased on Spokane Public Radio and the Washington State Standard
due to our Farm to School program and nutritious ingredient scratch made meals. The Nutrition Services staff really
stepped up this year and are continuing to work hard to improve our program.
Facilities
The first week of March the Maintenance crew focused on grounds prep including applying more fertilizer and pre
emergent, clearing fence lines, miscellaneous fence repair, and general sports field preparations.
The second week of March included lubing of heating/cooling equipment.
The crew made repairs to the Auditorium. There have been multiple complaints of cold air towards the main
entrance. After some investigation we found two large areas that needed insulation installed and patchwork.
During this week we also made repairs to Fort Colville fencing, installing posts, stretching fence, and gate repair. To
finish the week up we removed old sharp paint/rust from the front handrails at Aster school. The handrails have
been primed and repainted.
The third week consisted of replumbing the irrigation system in the CHS greenhouse. We also installed new boards
in the shot clocks in the gym at CHS. During this week we also repaired some sagging stucco in the CHS front entry,
repaired CHS bleachers and removed and replaced the front door to the Fish Hatchery classroom.
I would like to say thank you to our Maintenance crew for all of their hard work. As usual, if there are any questions
please don’t hesitate to give me a call.
