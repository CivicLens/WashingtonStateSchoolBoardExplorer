AGENDA ITEM:
Whenever possible each board member will give advance notice as soon as possible to the president or
superintendent of his/her inability to attend a board meeting. A majority of the board may excuse a board
members absence from a meeting if requested to do so. This action is not intended to be punitive but
expresses the desire of the board to operate with a quorum. An excused absence of a board member will
be voted on in the Consent Agenda, prior to the absence, same date as the absence, or retroactively if
there has not been enough notice to include the absence on the date of the Consent Agenda.
The board may declare a board members position vacant after four (4) consecutive unexcused absences
from regular board meetings if the absences were for reasons other than: 1) illness; 2) active or training
military duty; or 3) those authorized by resolution of the board.
If a board member is on active duty or training status with the military, the board will grant an extended
leave of absence to cover the period of service or training. The extended leave of absence may not have
the effect of extending the board members term. The board also has the authority to appoint a temporary
successor to the absent board members position. The temporary successor shall serve until the board
member returns or until the end of the board members term.

Resolution No. 1662
Establishment of a Custodial Fund for the JUUL Labs Litigation Settlement Proceeds
SUMMARY:
The Kent School District, among other school districts engaged the services of Dean Kawamoto from
Keller Rohrback, a Seattle law firm to file suit in a class action Multistate lawsuit against JUUL Labs.The
legal effort addressed the concerns related to the impact of JUUL products on educational institutions. As
a result of the lawsuit of the JUUL Labs Multistate litigation, the Kent School District has reached a
settlement with the defendant, JUUL Labs. The settlement restricts the use of settlement proceeds
received from JUUL Labs. More details about the litigation can be reviewed here.
In order to deposit these settlement proceeds and ensure compliance with the Settlement Agreement, it
is prudent that the Board establish a Custodial Fund. The attached resolution establishes a JUUL
settlement Custodial Fund and specifies the purpose and allowable uses of the funds.
This is a landmark piece of litigation benefiting students and District families. The District should be proud
of its participation and leadership in this litigation.
The first settlement check received by the district is for the amount of $351,237.88. The firm of Keller
Rohrback LLP estimates that the district should ultimately receive a total of $702,475, although that
amount is subject to change given calculation of fees and other litigation costs. Because the District is a
public entity with open financial records, the amount of the settlement is disclosable. All other details of
the agreement are governed by the confidentiality terms of the settlement agreement.
JUUL LABS LITIGATION SETTLEMENT FUND:
As part of the settlement agreement, the Kent School District is scheduled to receive four settlement
checks. These four installments are scheduled for payment in January 2024, January 2025, January
2026, and January 2027, with the first check representing roughly half of the total expected settlement
amount.
The settlement defendants include JUUL Labs including Altria and affiliated entities such as Altria Group,
Inc., Altria Client Service LLC., Altria Group Distribution Company, Philip Morris USA Inc., James
Monsees, Adam Bowen, Nicholas Pritzker, Hoyoung Huh, and Riaz Vilani.
The settlement funds will be directed into the districts Custodial Fund to leverage the resources for
impactful and sustainable initiatives. The trust fund will help address the Districts long-term goals and
priorities arising from the issues and challenges posed by students use of JUUL products and other
products posing similar addiction risk.

The settlement funds under both the Altria and JUUL government entity settlement agreements are
required to be used for compensatory restitution or remediation to address the consequences of JUULs
impact on the educational environment. The terms compensatory restitution or remediation are designed
to give government entities throughout the country the flexibility to adopt tailored, community-focused
approaches to youth vaping and addiction prevention, education, and cessation treatments, while also
requiring that these funds be used to effectuate the purpose of the litigation addressing the epidemic of
youth vaping and nicotine addiction.
KENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS PLANS FOR THE USE OF THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS:
The District is committed to utilizing the JUUL Labs settlement funds to address needs arising from
nicotine addiction and the adverse impact addictions can have on our students and educational
environment. The settlement funds will be dedicated to compensatory restitution and remediation efforts
that will support targeted interventions aimed at assisting affected students with personal and academic
development, address broader implications of nicotine addiction, as well as raise awareness to the
associated risks. Additionally, the funds may also be allocated to support cessation education and
