Parents expressed concerns about the inconsistency of science curriculum across schools, advocating for a more standardized approach.

The late start time was another point of contention, leading to supervision issues after school and prompting the PTA to offer before-school activities.  The parent highlighted the positive impact of specialized teachers for PE and music but lamented the cuts to the PE program and the loss of the strings program. Concerns were also raised about the adequacy of special education support for struggling students.
