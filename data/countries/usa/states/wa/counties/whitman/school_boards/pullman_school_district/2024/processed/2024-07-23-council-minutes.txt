N. Regular Agenda
Action, Ordinance: 1.
City Administrator Mike Urban explained that the Washington State Legislature modified
small works contracting requirements with SSHB 5268 in April 2023, which will become
effective July 1, 2024. The previous resolution considered by the Pullman City Council to
adopt these changes will require an update to Pullman City Code 1.107 for Procurement.
Along with these required legislative changes, the Washington State Auditor’s Office
recommends that purchasing and procurement policies be regularly reviewed as a form
of internal controls and best practices.

Although additions have recently been made to PCC 1.107, the change in the small works
roster item and the effects of pricing caused by recent inflation have prompted staff to
take a more holistic approach in this review. As such, the entire code was assessed, and
several updates are being recommended.

All updates are presented with grammar changes from ‘city’ to ‘City’, gender-neutral

pronouns, change ‘Finance Director’ to ‘Director of Finance & Administrative Services,’
purchasing authority thresholds to address market conditions better, create operational
efficiencies, and recognize concurrence with legislative intent, codify the institution and
growth of Public Purchasing Cooperatives, replace prior Small Works Roster operations
language with language commensurate with new legislation and provide additional
clarification around Consulting and Professional Services.
ORDINANCE NO. 24-08 - AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF PULLMAN, WHITMAN COUNTY, WASHINGTON, RELATING TO
PROCUREMENT, REVISING SECTIONS 1.107 TO THE PULLMAN CITY CODE
AND OTHER MATTERS PROPERLY RELATED THERETO.
Motion by Megan Guido, second by Pat Wright.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Nathan Weller, Pat Wright, Megan Guido, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira,
Trymaine Gaither
Action, Resolution: 2.
City Attorney Thaddeus O’Sullivan explained in March 2019, the State of Washington filed
a lawsuit against distributors of prescription opioids in Washington state, arguing that they
failed to alert law enforcement of suspicious opioid orders, illegally shipped those orders
into Washington for years, and contributed to the illegal supply of opioids, fueling the
state’s opioid epidemic.
Pullman executed the One Washington Memorandum of Understanding Between
Washington Municipalities (“One Washington MOU”) on April 26, 2022, to participate in
the distribution of funds from statewide opioid epidemic litigation against the
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain.
Pullman previously executed a Subdivision Settlement Participation Form and Allocation
Agreement Governing the Allocation of Funds Paid by the Settling Opioid Distributors in
Washington State (“Allocation Agreement I”) governing the distribution of settlement
funds received from McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., AmerisourceBergen
Corporation related to a settlement dated July 21, 2021. Likewise, Pullman previously
executed a Subdivision Settlement Participation Form and Allocation Agreement
Governing the Allocation of Funds Paid by the following Settling Opioid Distributors in
Washington State: (1) Walmart, (2) Teva, (3) Allergan, (4) CVS, and (5) Walgreens in the
continuing opioid litigation filed by Washington state. In April 2024, Pullman executed a
Settlement Participation Form to participate in a settlement with the “Janssen” Defendants:
(1) Johnson & Johnson; (2) Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine; (3) Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; (4) Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and (5) Janssen
Pharmaceutica, Inc. in return for Janssen’s net payment of $123,340,000 plus fees and
costs to the Washington State Attorney General.
In March 2024, Washington State entered a deal with Kroger Co. to resolve the pending
Kroger opioid litigation.
According to the One Washington MOU, The Kroger settlement funds will be distributed to
the state of Washington and participating municipalities. The settlement payments must be
spent to combat the opioid epidemic. Considering these funds, Pullman must release any
claims against the settling distributors and agree to be bound by the settlement
agreements.

To participate in the settlement agreements and the distribution of the Kroger settlement
funds, the city of Pullman must execute the Settlement Participation Form and the Allocation
Agreement III.
RESOLUTION R-46-24 - A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR OR
DESIGNEE TO EXECUTE THE SETTLEMENT PARTICIPATION FORM
RELATING TO THE KROGER CO. WASHINGTON STATE-WIDE OPIOID
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT DATED MARCH 22, 2024, AUTHORIZING THE
MAYOR AND FINANCE DIRECTOR TO TAKE ALL ACTIONS NECESSARY TO
EFFECT THE PURPOSE OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT; AND OTHER
MATTERS RELATED THERETO.

Action, Resolution, Regular Agenda: 3.
Assistant Fire Chief Andrew Chiavaras explained that the project included installing all
station alerting equipment furnished by the Fire Department, following the manufacturer's
specifications of the designed system and according to applicable code requirements.
Fidelity Solutions will connect all the equipment to the central control panel within each
station. They will program the station system per the Department's design and operational
requirements. Fidelity Solutions will work with appropriate representatives to establish the
connection with the dispatch center and thoroughly test the system to ensure the desired
functionality. Fidelity Solutions warranty our workmanship for 180 days and will work with
the manufacturer to ensure that the warranty is maintained and utilized, if necessary.
Following the City of Pullman procurement policies, the fire department will purchase
paging system equipment directly from US Digital Designs, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Honeywell. US Digital Designs has a solicitation contract with NPP.Gov, of which the City
of Pullman is a member.
The 2023 Capital Improvement Committee approved $251,000 for this project. The initial
estimate for equipment for both fire stations and the dispatch center was approximately
$182,844, and the initial installation was approximately $45,711. Due to inflation,
increased labor costs, and other factors, the installation bid came in at approximately
$35,015.59 over the initial estimate. Fire Department staff are exploring grant
opportunities and partnerships to offset the cost difference. They are confident that they
can absorb the difference through the budgetary process if they do not receive grant
funding for this project.
RESOLUTION NO. R-47-24 - A RESOLUTION ACCEPTING THE BASE BID OF
FIDELITY SOLUTIONS FOR THE INSTALLATION OF THE FIRE STATION
PHOENIX G2 PAGING ALERT SYSTEM PROJECT AND AUTHORIZING
EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THE CONTRACT FOR SAID PROJECT.

Action, Resolution: 4.
Deputy Public Works Clayton Forsmann explained that the Washington State
Transportation Improvement Board (TIB) has an annual funding program called the
Arterial Preservation Program (APP). The 2024 call for projects was announced on May
20, 2024, and all applications are due on August 9, 2024.
City staff would like to apply for funding for the Orchard Drive & Valley Road Resurfacing
project. The project proposes a 2-inch grind and inlay on Orchard Drive from its

intersection with Stadium Way near Beasley Coliseum, continuing northeast and north
until Orchard Drive turns west and becomes Valley Road, just west of the WSU Student
Recreation Center. The resurfacing project continues along Valley Road to its intersection
with Cove Way.
This fall, WSU is completing a sidewalk & path replacement project along this stretch of
road. Because of that project, six of nine ADA ramp upgrades required for the resurfacing
project will already be completed.
City staff completed the project's conceptual design in advance of this year's grant
application deadline. If successful, the grant application would provide funds for the City
to advance the project beyond the current conceptual design by finalizing the design,
plans, specifications, and construction of the project in 2025. The attached grant
application is in draft form. Staff will prepare and gather the remaining required
attachments & signatures and may still make a few final revisions before the submittal
deadline.
Staff anticipates that TIB will announce project selections by early December and, if
awarded, will immediately work to prepare and execute all associated grant paperwork to
keep the project moving forward effectively and on schedule for construction in 2025. The
grant will cover up to 85% of the eligible project costs, with the Arterial Street Fund
covering the resulting 15% City match (estimated at $74,029.00). The amount of funds
requested from TIB for this project is $348,664.
City staff is requesting the adoption of Resolution No. R-48-24 to execute the grant
application and authorize the acceptance of the grant agreement if awarded.
RESOLUTION NO. R-48-24 – A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE
EXECUTION OF A WASHINGTON STATE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT
BOARD GRANT APPLICATION FOR THE ORCHARD DRIVE & VALLEY ROAD
RESURFACING PROJECT; AUTHORIZING THE ACCEPTANCE AND
EXECUTION OF THE GRANT AGREEMENT IF AWARDED; AND OTHER
MATTERS RELATED THERETO.
