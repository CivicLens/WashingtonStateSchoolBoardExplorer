Recommended Action :

By motion, Pre-authorize AIP Grants 70 and 71 which
will assist with a fast turnaround of grant documents to
FAA.

Public Content
Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport
Pre-authorization request for Airport Improvement Program (AIP) Grants 70 and
71.
The Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport is requesting that the airport sponsors, the
City of Pullman and the City of Moscow, authorize the mayors and city attorneys to
accept and sign for Federal AIP grant funds prior to the grants being awarded to the
Airport. This will assist with expediting the completion of the grant applications, grant
offers, and grant awards. These grants are expected to be awarded in June, and the
timeframes to execute will be tight. Pre-authorization will assist with a fast turnaround
of grant documents to the FAA. Below are descriptions of each project, the maximum
amounts of each grant, and local share.
AIP-70 Airport Master Plan
This airport master plan is the final phase of the master planning process and will
emphasize landside planning. The prior master plan phases focused on the runway
realignment and new terminal facility. The focus of this master plan phase is to
maximize aeronautical development that will be supplemented by non-aeronautical
development with the intent to meet existing and future airport user needs while also
maximizing revenue generation for the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport. This 2025
master plan will focus on "opportunity zones" within the airport's developable land and
consider general aviation, cargo, commercial and charter airlines, FAA design
standards and grant restrictions, environmental constraints, and compatible land use.

This grant cannot be amended, and the requested pre-authorization amount is
considered to be within the expected full scope of the project. The local match,
estimated to be between $100,000 and $150,000, depending on the final grant
amount, will be paid from airport-generated funds and will not require additional
funding from the sponsors. The amount requested to be pre-authorized is not to
exceed $1,500,000.
AIP-71 Terminal Apron (Phase 4)
This project is for constructing an expansion of the terminal apron including an
additional 2,700 square feet of apron. This is a community development grant to the
Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport through a congressional place name. Construction
and engineering contracts are in place and the grant has already been programmed
by the FAA. This grant is specifically designated for the Pullman-Moscow Regional
Airport and cannot be transferred or utilized by any other airport.
The total project cost is $3,888,889, with the FAA share of $3,500,000 and the local
share of $388,889. The local share will be paid from airport funds and will not require
additional funding from the sponsors. This request for pre-authorization is not to
exceed$3,500,000

Public Content
The Cisco Nexus core switches, critical for routing network services across all City departments, were last
refreshed in 2018.
Regular hardware refreshes are planned and funded through departmental interfund budgets. The upcoming
refresh will utilize the budgeted minor equipment fund for hardware acquisition ($29,707, incl. tax).
Additionally, new software components, Cisco DNA Essentials and SmartNet, which were not included in the
last refresh, will be procured using the IT long-term project CIP fund ($29,210, incl. tax).
Ongoing subscriptions for these software components will be budgeted from the software licensing fund.
Professional services are also included to ensure comprehensive support for a successful migration ($5,665,
incl. tax).
IT seeks City Council approval to authorize the purchase and implementation of the new hardware and
software, with project execution managed by CompuNet under state contract pricing.

Recommended Action :

By motion, authorize the Mayor to execute a Memorandum
of Understanding between the City of Pullman, the Port of

Whitman County, and the Washington State Department of
Transportation regarding Lot 4 of the Port of Whitman
County Industrial Park Subdivision No. 2.

Public Content
The Port of Whitman County is pursing development of Lot 4 in the Port of Whitman
County Industrial Park Subdivision No. 2. Said lot is encumbered by a Washington
State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Temporary Construction Easement
(TCE), which limits the Ports ability to develop the lot. The TCE was acquired by
WSDOT in 1974 for construction of the future State Route (SR) 276 limited access
highway (North Bypass).
At their January 9, 2024, meeting the City Council adopted the North Arterial
Technical Memorandum and authorized staff to begin the process of acquiring the SR
276 right-of-way from WSDOT for a future City arterial. The memorandum states that
all WSDOT acquired TCEs will not be part of the right-of-way transfer, and that
WSDOT will release them to the abutting property owners prior to the right-of-way
transfer to the City. The process to release the TCEs and transfer the right-of-way to
the City is ongoing, but not expected to be completed prior to the Ports development
schedule. Therefore, WSDOT drafted the attached Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) at the Ports request, which will allow for the Port to develop their lot within the
boundaries of the TCE, prior to the subsequent planned TCE release. City staff
support this MOU, as it conforms with the adopted North Arterial Technical
Memorandum.

Public Hearing

Public Content
All public transit agencies in the state must submit a six-year transit development plan
(TDP) annually to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). The
TDP is commonly paired with an agency's annual report, and serves as a measure of
how local transit systems are performing and what their future plans are. The
information becomes part of the WSDOT Public Transportation Division's annual
report, which is presented to the State Legislature and referenced during policy and
funding decisions. A condition of submittal is that the plan is presented and has the
opportunity for discussion in a public forum. This public hearing will provide the City
Council and community an opportunity to consider Pullman Transit's TDP.

Public Content
On May 14, 2024 the Pullman City Council ratified the 2024-2026 Labor Agreement
with the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 1892. The change in
compensation for the members of the labor organization has created upward
compression with the non-union managers of Fire Chief and two Assistant Fire Chiefs.
As with past practice, City Council regularly tries to address issues of compression
after labor contract settlement and subsequent financial analysis. This agenda item
captures the financial analysis and presents an associated budget amendment to
address this compression issue.
There does appear to be a compression issue on these non-represented positions as
follows:
First Step

Top Step (5)

% Difference of Top Step

Chief

$ 120,240

$ 146,148

21.0% compared to Assistant Chief

Captain
(Union)

$ 96,396 *

$ 111,588 *

13.6% compared to Lieutenant

* Does not include premium pay for Paramedic Certification, Education, or Longevity.
Applyingthese items for the Assistant Chiefs (both are Paramedics, Education,
andLongevity eligible) the compression is actually -7.1% compared to Captain at the
top step with incentives. Fire Chief is not a Paramedic, but would be Education and
Longevity eligible.
Analysis of comparable municipalities in Eastern Washington yields the following
results when comparing top-step wages:

Cheney

Based on staff research of overall city budgets, populations, and cost of living
comparisons in each community the recommended base pay change for these two
positions are:

Improvement Program for the City of Pullman for the

Public Content
The Six-Year Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) is a planning document
prepared on a yearly basis that lists proposed Transit Division purchases/projects and

the transportation projects planned to be constructed. As funding is secured for TIP
projects, they are then submitted to the Washington State Department of
Transportation (WSDOT) for inclusion into the Statewide Transportation Improvement
Program (STIP). The STIP is then used by both the Federal Highway Administration
and the Federal Transit Administration to approve federally funded projects.
This year's TIP for the years 2025 through 2030 is attached for Council's
consideration. Arterial street projects are proposed to be funded with grants from the
Transportation Improvement Board, the Washington State Department of
Transportation and the Federal Surface Transportation Program, and locally received
arterial gas taxes. Transit projects are proposed to be funded with Federal Transit
Administration grants, WSDOT grants, State Rural Mobility grants, and Transit Fund
reserves. Total costs for all projects included in the TIP for the years 2025 through
2030 total $83,423,969.
Attached for reference are the projects included in the proposed TIP. Upon Council
approval, the TIP will be properly formatted on the STIP form and submitted to
WSDOT as appropriate.
On May 8, 2024, the TIP Committee met to consider various funding requests for the
years 2025-2030. The TIP Committee voted unanimously to recommend approval of
the TIP as presented.
The Planning Commission considered the TIP at their meeting on May 22, 2024, and
found it consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan. The Planning Commission
voted unanimously to recommend approval of the TIP as presented. The Arterial
Streets and Transit projects included in the TIP are also included in the Citys Capital
Improvement Plan (CIP). In other words, the TIP is a subset of the CIP.
The City Council held a public hearing on this item on June 11, 2024. There was no
written or oral testimony received.
At this time, staff recommends a motion that the City Council adopt the Six-Year
Transportation Improvement Program for 2025-2030 as presented.

Staff recommends adopting the UPDATED 2024 fire
department permit fee update

Public Content
Pullman City Code Capter 3.16 authorizes the City Council to set fire-related permit fees. By City Code, the
permit fees are to be reviewed every three (3) years and were last reviewed and adjusted in November of
2021. The Fire Department has recently reviewed and updated the fire-related permit feesbased on factors
such as square footage of the project as well as size of the suppression systems. The fee schedule is for two
types of Fire Department permits, Construction and Operational. The review was timely as the 2021
Washington State Fire Code was just adopted and went into effect in March 2024. The 2021 Fire Code had
many changes to the fire permits includingtwenty-three (23) additional construction permits and updates to
cover fifty-four (54) allowable operational fire permits.The fees were updated to reflect the current economic
state as well as the future economic forecast for the next three (3) years. The updated fee structure also
allows to better capture the staff time necessary to review, approve, and inspect commercial projects.

Move to adopt Resolution R-41-24, establishing new
procedures for establishing a small public works roster
process to award public works contracts and a consulting
services roster for architectural, engineering, and other
professional services.

Public Content
BACKGROUND ANALYSIS:
Small Works Roster:
A small works roster is a list of qualified, licensed contractors utilized by contracting
agencies, such as Pullman, for small public works construction projects costing
$350,000 or less. The small works roster process is a popular procurement tool that
Pullman already uses now. It is a less restrictive and more efficient selection process
for small public works projects as compared to a full, formal competitive bid process
for large public works projects.
In 2000, the Washington State Legislature adopted changes to chapter 39.04 of the
Revised Code of Washington (RCW), which established $200,000 as the upper
threshold for the small works roster contract amount. In 2004, Pullman amended
Pullman City Code (PCC) Chapter 1.107 to the same $200,000 threshold to reflect
and be consistent with the RCW threshold. Since then, the Legislature made changes
to Chapter 39.04 RCW threshold two more times, the latest in 2019 to $350,000.
Pullman has not changed its threshold since 2004, as it still remains at $200,000.
In 2023, the Washington State Legislature found there was a need to increase equity
and efficiencies in public works procurement and that public works contracting
agencies needed a streamlined and effective method for delivering small public works
projects while protecting workers' rights. The Legislature updated and revised the
small and limited works roster process to increase administrative efficiency and to
encourage greater participation and utilization by small, minority, women, and veteranowned businesses. As such, the Legislature adopted Senate Bill 5268 affecting

Public Works Procurement provisions contained within various locations of the
Revised Code of Washington. These changes in state law will become effective July
1, 2024.
Some of the more important and relevant changes the Legislature made are:
Small businesses bidding on public works now have a common definition.
The Office of Minority and Womens Business Enterprises (OWMBE) will house
a new small business certification program.
Municipal Research and Services Center (MRSC) Rosters will become the
designated statewide roster.
The small works roster contracting process in RCW 39.04.155 will be updated.
The previous limited public works threshold of $50,000 is replaced by a new
threshold of $150,000, and the change also allows for direct contracting under
certain conditions. A state agency or local government will notify all contractors
in the roster category for projects with an estimated cost of $150,000-$350,000.
There is no requirement for retainage or performance bonds for small public
works contracts under $5,000. For contracts under $150,000, agencies can still
allow 10% retainage in lieu of bonds, as provided in RCW 39.08.010.
Consulting Services Roster:
"Consulting services" are professional services that have a primarily intellectual
output or product and include architectural and engineering (A/E) services as defined
in RCW 39.80.020. The City currently maintains a Consulting Services Roster of A/E
firms, as well as other professional services such as design, planning, management,
legal, communications, and environmental consulting. The requirement for Pullman to
maintain this is specified in chapter 39.80 RCW.
Selecting A/E consultants through this process requires Pullman to have established
a qualifications-based selection procedure. Under that process, Pullman assesses
the expertise of competing firms and selects the most highly qualified firm, then
negotiates the final project scope and associated fee. If Pullman and the most highly
qualified firm cannot reach an agreement on project scope, schedule, and budget,
then Pullman can negotiate with the next most highly qualified firm. Advanced
notification of a need for an A/E service must be provided via legal advertisement for
a given need or solicitation for a consultant roster.
The MRSC has established a Consulting Services Roster that Pullman must utilize
when Pullman uses the Small Works Roster. Pullman is not allowed to use one
without the other. MRSC Rosters provides all of the roster maintenance established
by State law. This is a package service due to the structure of the legal notices.
POLICY AND FISCAL IMPACTS
The proposed Resolution now before the Council accomplishes the following:

Allows the City to contract with MRSC to have the Citys official rosters hosted
in the online database for City use for small public works contracts and
consulting services developed and maintained by MRSC through MRSC
Rosters. This is required to comply with the changes in State law as adopted by
Senate Bill 5268.
Small Works Roster:
Clarifies the procedures for small works roster usage, pursuant to RCW
39.04.155.
Raises the upper threshold for small works to coincide with the thresholds
established in RCW 39.04.155, which is $350,000. Any public works
project over that threshold must comply with public bidding rules and
cannot use the small works roster processes.
Raises the previous limited public works threshold of $50,000 and
replaces it with a new threshold of $150,000
Allows for direct contracting under certain conditions. Pullman will notify
all contractors in the roster category for projects with an estimated cost of
$150,000-$350,000.
Delegates authority to the Mayor to award bids for public works projects
costing less than or equal to $350,000 and retains authority for the City
Council to award bids for public works projects over $350,000.
Consulting Services Roster:
Clarifies the Consulting Services Roster is allowed for A/E services not
subject to public bidding requirements.
Establishes an effective process for reviewing and selecting Statement of
Qualifications Proposals.
Delegates authority to the Mayor to award bids or quotations for A/E
services costing less than or equal to $350,000, and retains authority for
the City Council to award bids or quotations for A/E services over
$350,000.
The proposed resolution conflicts with certain sections of PCC 1.107. Staff is working
to create concurrence while reviewing PCC 1.107 in its entirety. If approved, staff will
have an ordinance with recommended updates for consideration at the next Council
Meeting Agenda.
OPTIONS
1. Adopt the Resolution establishing new procedures for establishing a small

public works roster process to award public works contracts, and a consulting
services roster for architectural, engineering, and other professional services.
2. Do not adopt the Resolution and provide alternative direction to staff.
