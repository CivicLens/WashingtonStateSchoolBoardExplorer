Written Comments ---<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->[ Audra Eckenberg ]<!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {msodata-placement:same-cell;}-->Is it financially feasible to irrigate the grounds surrounding all of the school buildings on city water

at a reduced frequency instead of shutting water off completely. The future costs of having to replace/replant grass and foliage
is exponentially higher than maintaining the cost of watering what is already planted. Additionally, the fire and safety hazard of
having dried and dead grass and plants is concerning.
