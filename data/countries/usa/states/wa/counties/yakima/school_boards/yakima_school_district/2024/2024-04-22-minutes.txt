2. Superintendent's Update
Supt Greene introduced Asst Supt Anthony Murietta to provide an update on the recall process. His recap starts at 29:40 at this link. He shared statistics detailing the number of employees recalled in each union, emphasizing his commitment that even one employee left unrecalled is unacceptable.
Supt Greene requested an update from Deputy Supt Stacey Locke on the before and after-school program that will accommodate parents dropping off their children. The RFP was issued today, and we expect responses within 14 days. We are eager to see the opportunities this program will offer in the future.
Supt Greene commended the student fellows for their consistent attendance and enthusiasm in shaping the Student Voice Policy over the past few years. Additionally, Ezra Rottman has been honored with the Princeton Scholarship.
Superintendent Greene concluded his update by addressing the modifications to the high school music programs. He noted a significant increase in participation at Eisenhower High School, where the marching band grew from 31 to 148 students over three years. The district remains committed to supporting the arts, recognizing their educational value. The main adjustment involves reducing the number of preparation periods and consolidating classes with lower enrollment to retain music teachers. Although this will result in a slight decrease in course offerings, the district will still provide a broader range of options than were available in 2019.
