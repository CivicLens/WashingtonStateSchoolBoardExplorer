The meeting minutes detail the Enumclaw School District Board's review and approval of several Governance Process (GP) policies.  Specifically, they reviewed GP-4 (Monitoring Board Governance Process and Board-Staff Relationship Policies), GP-8 (Board Membersâ€™ Code of Conduct), and GP-11 (Process for Addressing Board Member Violations). The board voted to accept these policies as approved in January 2011 and agreed to uphold the Washington State School Directors Association Code of Governance.  The meeting also included a monitoring report on EL-11 (Communication and Counsel to the Board), EL-12 (Communication with the Public), and EL-3 (Treatment of Parents, Students and the Public). The board will respond to these monitoring reports at a later meeting. Additionally, the board held an executive session for a student disciplinary hearing.
