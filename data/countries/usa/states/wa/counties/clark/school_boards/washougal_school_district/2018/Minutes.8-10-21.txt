D. Superintendentâ€™s Update
Superintendent Mary Templeton welcomed everyone and shared that all our energy is going toward opening schools.
Mary said she is thankful and grateful to all who are putting the work in to make it possible to have students in schools all
five days per week. She mentioned that August is busy as it usually is with professional development. She stated that
yes, we are masking, as a mandate from the governor.
Assistant Superintendent Aaron Hansen said yes, we are following the masking mandate and will change as needed. In
the HR world, he said we have had a great hiring season with great new hires. Aaron said we had a wonderful summer
school with many students participating and some finishing up this week. He said we had more programs and students
than we've ever had and also had free summer camps with 179 students participating.
Assistant Superintendent Renae McMurray expressed her excitement to welcome students back on August 31st. Renae
also said that she's excited to start new programs like Dual Language and Transitional Kindergarten. The Washougal
Learning Academy (WLA) started last year, will be growing and helps to meet the needs of families. She stated that we
are wrapping up our summer programs this week. Renae gave many thanks to the summer teachers and administrators.
She shared that professional learning continues with Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), inclusive practices and
we are implementing AVID district-wide.
E. Citizen Comments - General
Patricia Bellamy spoke in opposition to masking and Critical Race Theory. She said the equity policy the board approved is
unjust and the district is implanting fear.
Emily Miller said she spoke at a previous meeting regarding her son who had an incident due to wearing a mask and she
did not feel like it was handled appropriately. She said that she proposes that the board lift the outdated mask mandate.
She also stated that her two high school students would not be returning as long as masks are required.

Gail Anderson shared that she has lived in Washougal for 27 years and is here as a resident and teacher. She thanked the
board for getting the kids back in school and stated she will do anything asked even if she doesn't agree with it to have
the kids in school. She shared all the curriculums that she has taught and stated that she is not being asked to teach
Critical Race Theory. She also commented that she has attended many school board meetings over the years and time
limits on speaking is not new. Gail said she recognizes that the board is working really hard and are all volunteers.
Wendi Moose, parent of a WSD student and a teacher in another district, stated that the equity work being done in
Washougal and other districts is not Critical Race Theory, masks are necessary, and coronavirus is real. She thanked the
board for continuing to work for the children.
