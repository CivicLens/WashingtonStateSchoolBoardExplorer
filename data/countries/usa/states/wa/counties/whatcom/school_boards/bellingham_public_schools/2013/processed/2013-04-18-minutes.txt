REGULAR AGENDA ITEMS
Audience
Solstice Lappin addressed the board to raise awareness on Type 1 Diabetes to allow school
personnel to inject individuals at school who are experiencing a hypoglycemic, low blood sugar
event. Currently, staff call 911 rather than give glucagon injections. She feels glucagon injections
should be in the same category as epi-pens.

participation and expressed appreciation for Jay Jordan and Mark Dalton for their work in getting
this program started.
Ken Gass attended the National School Boards Association Annual Conference. He was
impressed by the quality and quantity of the workshops offered and recommended a book Every
Child, Every Day by Mark Edwards, which explores how laptops can be used to achieve success.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report
Superintendent Greg Baker submitted a memo explaining his analysis and rationale for the
retirement of Larrabee Elementary School. He also distributed to each director a compilation of
the data gathered from the Facilities Planning Task Force and summarized his thoughts about the
process and how he reached his recommendation. Dr. Baker recommended that Larrabee
Elementary School be retired as a K-5 elementary school at a future date between 2014–2016.
He will continue to meet with neighbors and interested parties to explore the possibility of
repurposing the school, possibly for an early childhood program. The Board will hold a public
hearing to receive public comment on the possible closure of Larrabee Elementary School and on
the district’s analysis of the effects of the proposed closure. The Board will determine a date for
the public hearing to allow time for legal notices to be filed.
Dr. Baker asked Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations Ron Cowan for a budget
update. He indicated we do not expect any significant reduction in revenue from the state and
expect to end the fiscal year in better condition than previously, including an increase in
reserves. Mr. Cowan reported the 2013–2014 budget that is being prepared will be conservative.
