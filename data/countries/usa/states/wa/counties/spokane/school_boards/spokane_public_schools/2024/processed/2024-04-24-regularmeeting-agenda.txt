Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.
