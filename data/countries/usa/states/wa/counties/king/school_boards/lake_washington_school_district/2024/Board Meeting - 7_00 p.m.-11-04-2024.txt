5. Interdistrict Cooperative Agreement - American Indian
And Alaska Native K-12 Students, 2024-25

Meeting :

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Authorize the Superintendent to enter into Interdistrict
Cooperation agreements with Bellevue and Northshore
school districts for the Indian Education program for the

2024-25 school year, as presented.

Public Content
SITUATION
Interdistrict cooperative contracts for services to American Indian and Alaska Native students in the Bellevue and Northshore School districts
resulted when the Eastside Native American Education Consortium was formed in 1984. At that time, the Lake Washington School District
agreed to be the overseeing agency (sponsoring school district) to receive annual Title VI Indian Education funds from the U.S. Department
of Education. Since the level of Title VI funding does not adequately cover program costs, each school district agreed to contribute a
prorated cost per native student enrolled in the Title VI programs.
Estimated cost charged to each participating district for 2024-25 is as follows:

School District

# of Students

Cost to Participating District

Bellevue School District

59

Students @ $126.00 = $ 7,434

Northshore School District

86

Students @ $126.00 = $10,836

Lake Washington School District

124

Students @ $126.00 = $15,624

RECOMMENDATION

The Board of Directors authorizes the Superintendent to enter into Interdistrict Cooperation agreements
with Bellevue and Northshore school districts for the Indian Education program for the 2024-25 school
year as presented.
