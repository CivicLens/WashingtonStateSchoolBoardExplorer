OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
Sept. 17, 2015 - 1306 Dupont St., Bellingham, Washington
Call to Order/Roll Call: Kelly Bashaw called the meeting to order at 6:15 p.m. Present:
Directors Kelly Bashaw (President), Douglas Benjamin, Kenneth Gass, Camille Hackler,
Steven Smith, Superintendent Greg Baker, and recorder Ruth Rasmussen
Audience:
No Audience Presented
Recognition and Awards:
 Presentation of Accreditation Plaques: Assistant Superintendent Steve Clarke
introduced Bob Estes, State Lead Facilitator Coach with Northwest Educational
Service District (NWESD) 189. Mr. Estes said the district and four high schools
are accredited for six years as a result of the completion of the Association of
Educational Service Districts’ (AESD) accreditation process. At the request of the
district, AESD agreed last year to modify its process for Bellingham Public
Schools so that all four high schools were accredited together. Mr. Estes said
Steve Clarke was instrumental in advocating for this change, which was an
acknowledgement of how the high schools operate holistically within the
framework of The Bellingham Promise. Mr. Estes then presented accreditation
plaques to each of the high school principals – James Everett, Squalicum High
School; Michelle Kuss-Cybula, Sehome High School; Byron Gerard, Options
High School; and Jeff Vaughn, Bellingham High School.
Superintendent's Announcements and Report:
 State Budget: Governor Inslee is convening a McLeary plan workgroup focused
on education funding. As part of its work, the group will conduct listening tours
around the state, including one in Everett. Dr. Baker will keep board members
updated on the group’s activities and schedule.
 Seattle Teachers Strike Update: As noted in today’s article in the Seattle Times,
Seattle teachers reached a settlement following a weeklong strike, and students
have started the new school year. This strike, along with others that occurred
throughout the state at the start of school, is tied in part to the state’s failure to
fully fund public education as required by the Supreme Court’s McCleary
decision.
 WASA Request: The Washington Association of School Administrators
(WASA) has asked some district superintendents to consider sending a letter to

state legislators regarding the McLeary decision and advocating for full state
funding.
Staffing: Jonah Stinson joined the district on Sept. 1 as Director, School Safety
and Emergency Management.
Food Services/Central Kitchen Planning: A Food Services Advisory Group will
work with students, parents, community partners and district staff in coming
months to develop a vision for our food services program as the district prepares
to build a central kitchen and transition to healthier, from-scratch food for
students.
Levy Renewals: The district’s operations levy and technology levy will expire
next year, and district leaders are beginning to plan for replacement levies that
will be on the February 2016 ballot. A Student Technology Think Tank has been
formed to study the concept of 1:1 computer technology for students. This would
provide a tablet or other device to students in certain grades, programs, or
subjects. A key task for think tank members will be to review the 16 outcomes in
The Bellingham Promise and determine how a 1:1 tool will support those
outcomes. A board study session on Oct. 22 will explore this concept in more
detail.
Facilities Update:
o Lowell: The new elevator will be operational by the end of September. A
community gathering to celebrate the completion of the addition and
renovation work is planned for 3 p.m. on October 8 at the school.
o Happy Valley and Parkview: Construction work is going well on both
projects.
o Sehome: Dykeman, Inc. will design the project and one of their
consultants will help facilitate the community-wide visioning process
which will begin soon.
