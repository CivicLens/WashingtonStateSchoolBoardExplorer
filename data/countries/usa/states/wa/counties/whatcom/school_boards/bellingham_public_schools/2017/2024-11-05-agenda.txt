Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
As part of the permitting process associated with the construction of Options High School, the district was required to construct a
new stormwater facility (stormwater detention pond).
The pond serves to accept stormwater runoff, remove pollutants from the stormwaterandcontrol the release of stormwater in
order to prevent downstream flooding and erosion. The pond accepts stormwater from both our Options High School property
and the public roads immediately adjacent to our property (Franklin and Iowa Streets).
As a condition of final project acceptance by the City of Bellingham, the district must grant an easement to the City for the
purposes of allowing stormwater to flow from the public roads into the pond and to allow the City to inspect the pond to ensure it
is functioning as designed.

3.1 Resolution 29-17, Budget Extension Transportation Vehicle Fund

Meeting :

Dec 6, 2017 - Regular Board Meeting and Public
Hearing, 6 p.m.

Type :

Action

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the request outlined below for board
authorization of a change to the amount previously
budgeted in the transportation vehicle fund for the 2017-18
school year. As Superintendent, I have reviewed this
request and fully support board approval of Resolution 2917.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent
Explanation of Issue:
Summary: We needed to purchase school buses last school year after the school bus levy passed to
prepare for the changes in new school start/end times. Now we need to adjust our budget to reconcile the
revenue we have received to backfill these bus purchases.
Detailed Background: This budget extension is necessary because, contrary to earlier guidance we
received, state accounting rules do not allow interfund loan amounts received in the Transportation

Vehicle Fund to be considered as revenue. Following the earlier guidance, we had recorded these as
revenue.
As a result of being required to remove interfund loan amounts from revenue we need to make
adjustments to our 2017-18 Transportation Vehicle Fund budget. Specifically, we need to remove the
$1,300,000 interfund loan amount from budgeted revenues and expenditures (see page TVF1 item 9500
Long Term Financing; and TVF2 item 91). In terms of cash flow, we will receive the $1,300,000 in cash,
as a result of the interfund loan and we purchased a valuable asset, namely buses, but these do not
appear on this budget.
The second adjustment is to reduce budgeted expenditures by $1,317,471 (see TVF2 item 33). The
expenditure was bigger than it needed to be. The higher expenditure was to allow for potential changes in
timing of purchases. Reducing the budgeted expenditure reflects our planned purchase timeline and
ensures that we end 2017-18 with a positive fund balance (see TVF2 Ending Fund Balance G.L. 819).
The third adjustment is a small reduction in revenue we expect from the state of $53,024 (TVF1, item
4499). The operational effect associated with these adjustments is that while we will still order the same
number of buses in 2017-18 as we anticipated, a few of the buses will be delivered after the end of the
fiscal year, August 31, 2018.
The net result of these adjustments is to reduce the beginning fund balance by $1,264,447, comprised of
the elimination of Restricted for Other Purposes and creation of a balance in Unassigned for Fund
Balance (see TVF2 Beginning Fund Balance G.L 819 and G.L.890). While this results in a negative
beginning fund balance under state accounting rules, our actual beginning cash balance was $467,194
and the district owned valuable assets not reflected in the budget; and we end the year with a positive
fund and cash balance.
Notably, state accounting does not reflect accrual accounting, which would show that the district
purchased assets (buses) in return for using cash and was therefore in a positive net asset position
(positive fund balance). State accounting also does not reflect cash flow reporting in which the district has
cash in the bank because it loaned the money. Accordingly, the presentation is needed to comply with
state rules regarding funds.
