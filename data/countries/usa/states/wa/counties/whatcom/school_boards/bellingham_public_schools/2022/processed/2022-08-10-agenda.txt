Hearing

Explanation of Issue:

State law requires the district to comply with certain competitive bidding requirements as specified in RCW 28A.335.190 and Chapter 39.04
RCW. These requirements lead to lengthy timelines of at least 30 days before awarding a contract.
Under conditions that may result in immediate physical injury and damage to district property in the absence of prompt remedial action, and
when the public interest and property of the district would suffer material injury and damage by delay, the statute allows the Board to declare

an emergency and waive the competitive bidding and other requirements of RCW 28A.335.190 and RCW 39.04.
Resolution 17-22 allows staff to immediately identify and hire consultants and contractors to assist us with emergency electrical repairs and
replacements, cleanup and protection to stabilize, protect and mitigate additional loss, and all other actions taken with respect to or related to
the electrical power surge at Alderwood Elementary School, June 28, 2022.
