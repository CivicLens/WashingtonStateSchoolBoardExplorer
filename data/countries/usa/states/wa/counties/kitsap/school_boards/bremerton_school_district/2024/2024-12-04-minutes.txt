Principal Powell share that she hasn’t been fully staffed with paras yet this year. There hasn’t been anyone
applying for the open positions and she has also had some turnover. When the SPED para positions are not
filled they are required to move the Gen Ed positions to SPED. But then it impacts lunch and recess schedules.
Teachers are filling in to make sure there is coverage. They currently need 2 preschool, 2 Gen Ed and 2 SPED
paras. The Boys and Girls club come 3 times a week and play games with kids on the playground
Director Hurley asked if there is currently any programs for students to fill these rolls for credit.
