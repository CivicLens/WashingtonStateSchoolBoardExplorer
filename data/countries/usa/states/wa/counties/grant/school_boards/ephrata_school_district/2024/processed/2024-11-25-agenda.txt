b. Approve Contractor to Complete Electronic Door System at Parkway Intermediate
Presenter: Sarah Vasquez
The Ephrata School District would like to hire e3 Solutions to finish the electronic door system at Parkway Intermediate. The IT Director solicited
three quotes from the small works roster. One of the companies was not responsive and the other was not qualified to work in the existing Lenel
S2 Access Control System. Currently, the main vestibule of the school is electronic and integrated with door access controls and lockdown
buttons. As the Parkway doors and hardware are replaced, (by a separate contractor) e3 Solutions will come in and do the work to tie in the
electronic locking and keycard system to the additional doors.
