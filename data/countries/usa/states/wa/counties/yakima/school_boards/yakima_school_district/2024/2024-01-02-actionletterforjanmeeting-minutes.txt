Yakima, Washington

2. Pledge of Allegiance
President Walker led the board in the Pledge of Allegiance.
3. Yakama Land Acknowledgement
A video of YSD students reciting the Land Acknowledgement was played.
B. AGENDA
1. Budget Update – Jake Kuper, Asst Supt of Finance
Budget Reduction Confirmation: Mr. Kuper reaffirmed the district's ongoing budget reduction of
$20 million, highlighting the financial impact of the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA).
Budget Cut Inquiry: Supt Greene invited board members to raise questions regarding the
upcoming budget cuts, emphasizing the importance of clear understanding and decision-making.
Budget Reduction Process Overview: Supt Greene outlined the comprehensive process
undertaken for budget reduction, including meetings with the YEA President, principals, union
representatives, leadership teams, and all school administration, totaling 52 budget meetings
since November.
The update focused on detailing the district's financial challenges, strategies for budget
reduction, and the importance of strategic planning and communication in managing these
changes.
2. Proclamations - Dr. Trevor Greene, Superintendent
The board conducted a review of the monthly Proclamations we currently acknowledge. They
have requested a draft proposal for future Proclamations to be submitted by January 16th. This
proposal is to include a purpose statement and a criteria checklist for selecting Proclamations,
taking into account our audience, the public's viewpoint, and the individuals or groups we aim to
recognize and express gratitude towards through these Proclamations. Kirsten Fitterer will be
responsible for preparing this draft.

3. Policy Review - Norm Walker, Board President
Barb Fiscus will work on updating agreed upon edits/changes to the zero policies:
0100, 0540, and 0570
Barb to add all 1100+ policies to August Retreat
4. School Tour
The board left from 10:45am - Noon to tour the Davis High School Auditorium while it is under
construction.
5. Post-Pandemic "Why's"
Director Navarro Jr. has requested clarification on the forecasted decrease in student enrollment
over the next decade. This decline comes at a time when our student population exhibits an
increased need for social and emotional support, a consequence of the pandemic's effect on
mental health. Additionally, there has been a notable uptick in both private and homeschooling
enrollments.
The lack of new housing developments within the YSD area, in contrast to neighboring districts,
further exacerbates this issue.
In light of a predicted reduction of 1,000 students over the next five years, as confirmed by Mr.
Kuper, the board is faced with the challenge of adopting a more proactive stance to mitigate the
impact of this enrollment downtrend.
Despite perceptions of Yakima being home to predominantly young families, Director Beckett
points out that recent census report from 2020 to 2023 indicates a mere 1% increase in
population, suggesting that the area is not experiencing a decline in residents.
Next Steps: Jake will coordinate with Director Navarro, Jr. to refine the questions for further
exploration. This information will subsequently be disseminated to the entire board.
Additionally, individual follow-ups with each director will be conducted to address any further
inquiries related to this matter.
6. Attendance - Omar Santoy, Executive Director of Student Services
Omar Santoy presented on attendance definitions, noting discussions with OSPI to correct their
guidance towards allowing 10 absences per 180 days. The board reviewed OSPI and Skyward
attendance data. OSPI's current policy marks students absent if they miss more than 50% of the
day. Mr. Santoy proposed aiming for "95% of students to attend 95% of the time" and suggested
YSD should credit students for attending at least half a day, ensuring accurate attendance
reporting to the board.
VP Villanueva highlighted that previously, attendance data presented to the Board focused
exclusively on students attending all 180 days, suggesting this approach could artificially elevate
data, thereby misrepresenting the achievement of attendance goals. She asked clarifying
questions on the discrepancy in data. Mr. Santoy clarified that over the last three years, both
OSPI and Skyward data have been consistently provided to the Board, adhering to established

guidelines while ensuring accuracy. However, a detailed examination has revealed inaccuracies
in how absences are recorded. Mr. Santoy proposed revising the method for tracking absences to
better reflect actual attendance patterns.
Next Steps:
VP Villanueva has called for an in-depth evaluation of the Compass reports to ensure they reflect
recent updates accurately. Mr. Santoy will review historical data for any inconsistencies. His
team will prepare reports for the board's review, facilitating a side-by-side comparison to inform
potential adjustments in reporting methods. The board intends to reconvene with Mr. Santoy in
late spring to discuss these findings, dependent on establishing clear reporting guidelines and
timelines. Mr. Santoy will also participate in the January 2025 Board Retreat to outline a
communication plan regarding these changes, contingent on the board's decisions on reporting
standards.
7. Parent/Community Engagement - Kirsten Fitterer, Executive Director of Communications and
Engagement
Kirsten Fitterer presented two documents related to Family & Community Engagement,
highlighting the structure of engagement through Tier I (general communication), Tier II (Parent
Advisory Council - PAC feedback), and Tier III (Native American programming).
The session aimed to define family and community engagement and assess its current state
within the district. TG emphasized the goal of achieving board consensus on this definition to
ensure unified community engagement efforts.
"Co-Design" was identified as a key strategy for effective community collaboration, emphasizing
building relationships and listening to community needs before proposing solutions.
Director Navarro, Jr. expressed a desire to enhance parent engagement and provide parents with
more influence, seeking feedback on the effectiveness of these efforts.
Director Beckett emphasized the ongoing nature of these initiatives and requested more frequent
updates to inform the board.
VP Villanueva highlighted the importance of notifying board members about significant
meetings to ensure their attendance, differentiating between the roles of board members and the
Superintendent in community engagement.
The session was a comprehensive discussion on improving family and community engagement,
with a focus on unified strategies, effective communication, and active board involvement in
engagement processes.
8. Inclusion - Nancy Smith, Executive Director of Special Education
Director Rice reported that Special Education is going to be a big topic at Legislation. Supt
Greene is very proud of creating opportunities to all students no matter their abilities.

Nancy Smith presented on the attached presentation. Inclusion is not a new thing, YSD has been
doing this for years. Some definition:
IDEA - Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
LRE - Least Restrictive Environment
LRE 1: Placed in general education 80%–100% of the school day
LRE 2: Placed in general education 40%–79% of the school day
LRE 3: Placed in general education 0%–39% of the school day
Inclusion - the belief that all students have a right to meaningfully participate in the general
education setting, both academically and socially. …allowing them to learn in the general
education classroom, interact with peers, and engage the core curriculum.
IEP - Individual Education Plan
Director Rice asked if we have ever included the LRE percentages into the Compass/Strategic
Plan and Ms. Smith assured her that at McClure Elementary, we have autistic students that are
fully immersed into general ed classrooms.
President Walker asked what the biggest challenge for classroom teachers is when considering
inclusion and Ms. Smith said dealing with behavioral needs and skill/knowledge level on SpEd
services.
VP Villanueva asked what the need of a SpEd kid is when in Gen Ed classroom? Is there data
that shows the impact on learning for the Gen Ed students? Ms. Smith said we don't have a lot of
data on this - but a good teacher knows how to monitor this growth. Does the law require a
certain LRE level? No - but it helps teachers offer data to our parents that their SpEd student can
work towards full inclusion. And her final question – if Ms. Smith had a magic wand, how would
she use it? Ms. Smith said to have all SpEd students be included into PE today. Have SpEd
students respected and treated the same as Gen Ed.
9. Closing - Dr. Trevor Greene, Superintendent
Director Rice shared that the Legislative Session will be Jan 28-29. There will be a few
breakouts only and a virtual component is offered this year. The board engaged in a discussion
