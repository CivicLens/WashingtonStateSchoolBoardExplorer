The May 6, 2024, AM Regular Board Meeting convened at 7:02 a.m. Present included Board members
David Barnes, Lupita Flores, Nikki Keller, Carlos López, and Cindy Reed, Superintendent Mark
Anderson, Director of Student Success Mindy Schultz, and Recording Secretary Julie Notman.
1. Communication Check-In: Discussed the complaints and follow-up conversations about a play the
HS students attended in Seattle to satisfy a requirement for their College in the High School classes.
Students in National Honor Society also attended. Changes going forward: attend only local plays, have
the play approved by the building principal, read the script ahead of time, and have a parent permission
form with specific information.
2. August Retreat Discussion: Can be held at any time of the month, does not have to coincide with the
AM board meeting [if any]. The board needs to discuss the next use of levy Capital Projects

funds, could have a presentation at the retreat for options and cost of updating the track & field.
FYI-We will have the 2024-2025 budget on the agenda for approval in June.
3. Policy Discussion: [Per Policy 1400] Starting in July we will be required to audio record all
meetings. We are researching how best to accomplish this. Policy 1611-discussed timeline of
implementing new rule about school board members and coaching.
4. Athletic Code Update: There are some word/phrase changes to bring the code up to date but no
policy changes. Carlos moved with 2nd by Lupita to approve the Athletic Code updates as presented;
motion carried.
5. Capital Project Update: With our enrollment numbers dropping it is going to be extremely difficult
to operate and maintain three different properties. We need to look at short-term and long-term plans for
when our levies and bond end to continue those at the same rate to provide funding for a [PK-5 building,
a remodel at TES or other] solution. Discussed enrollment loss due to lower birth rates, families
enrolling their children in private or online school or choosing to home-school.

Mark explained the challenges in the staffing changes that must occur in the Special Ed
department to help balance/preserve the budget. Enrollment in Special Ed at MWC is 23 with
two teachers but 40 with one teacher at the HS. The district gives early notice of changes to
staff so they have time to look for other positions if they prefer.
