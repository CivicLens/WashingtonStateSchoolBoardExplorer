Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director, Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
The original construction contract with Dawson only included renovating the existing Sehome High
School baseball field by only providing new grass turf because funds had not been approved for any
Phase 2 synthetic turf field work at the time the contract was executed.
With the passage of the 2018 bond, we now have funds available for Phase 2 of our synthetic turf field
projects, which includes the new synthetic turf baseball field and related improvements at Sehome High
School.
Now that we are doing this Phase 2 work the original construction contract must be modified via a
Change Order.
The attached change order represents costs for improvements to the site surrounding the new baseball
field (concrete and utility work) as well as construction of the various support buildings (restrooms,
storage buildings, dugouts, concession stand, etc.) associated with the new baseball field.

Board approval of the attached change order is requested.
