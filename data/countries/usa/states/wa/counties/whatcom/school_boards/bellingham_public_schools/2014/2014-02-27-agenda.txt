Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
Bellingham School District is expected to exceed $40,000 in purchases from Apple, Inc., prompting a
need for a competitive purchasing process to be in place. Based on a recommendation from Kurt Gazow,
Executive Director of Technology, I am requesting that the Bellingham School District enter into an
interlocal agreement with Sunnyside School District, negating the need for quotes or a formal bid process.
RCW 39.34 gives public agencies the ability to enter into joint purchase agreements allowing one agency
to purchase items using another agency's purchasing processes. To do so, both agencies must enter into
an interlocal agreement.
I request the board approve the attached interlocal agreement with Sunnyside School District.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached Study and Survey
Agreement which I have reviewed and approve.
Ratification of my signature is requested.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
One of the requirements associated with procuring state construction assistance funding for qualifying projects is for the district to have
completed a Study and Survey of all existing facilities within the past 6 years. The Study and Survey process includes a review of many
facility components including a description of the types and kinds of systems and subsystems used in the facilities and an assessment of
their physical condition, including status of compliance with current codes and regulations. The state will provide us with a $34,000 grant to
complete the Study and Survey process and produce the required documentation.
We propose to utilize the Construction Services Group from ESD 112 to complete the required Study and Survey. This is the same group
that provided outstanding service to the district during the Facility Task Force work last year.
The attached agreement between the District and ESD 112 formalizes the scope of work and associated fees.You will note that the fee is the
same as the grant amount we will receive from the state and there will be no cost to the district other than staff time.Because the timing of
the beginning of this work did not coincide with a scheduled board meeting, Dr. Baker executed the agreement in order for the work to begin.
Your requested approval will ratify his signature.
Mr. Cowan will be available to answer any questions.

Response Grant Assistance Agreement

Meeting :

Feb 27, 2014 - Regular School Board Meeting with

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached Emergency Response Grant
Assistance Agreement which I have reviewed and
approve. Ratification of my signature is requested.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
The 2013 Legislature allocated $10 million in competitive grant funds to help school districts with implementing an effective emergency
response system. This $10 million statewide grant focuses on "implementing emergency response systems using evolving technology to
expedite the response and arrival of law enforcement in the event of a threat or emergency at a school." After consultation with our partners
at the Bellingham Police Department we decided that this work (getting help to a school in the event of a threat or emergency) should be our
top safety priority. By pursuing this grant we will be able to leverage our bond funds with state grant dollars, thereby allowing us to further the
use of our bond funds for additional safety and security measures. The grant deadline is March 17 with awards to follow in April.
Please note that our work associated with "implementing an emergency response system using evolving technology to expedite the
response and arrival of law enforcement in the event of a threat or emergency at a school is not contingent on being awarded this grant. We
will be making improvements in this area regardless of whether or not we receive the grant.
We propose to utilize the Construction Services Group from ESD 112 to assist us with work associated with planning and writing this grant
as well as implementation of the proposed measures. We are fortunate to be working with ESD 112 as their Safety and Security Lead, Jay
Garthwaite, sat on the committee who wrote the grant parameters and has extensive experience in safety and security. He has been an
invaluable resource as we've been working with our Bellingham Police Department partners.
The attached agreement between the district and ESD 112 formalizes the scope of work and associated fees. Because the timing
asssociated with providing this assistance did not coincide with a scheduled board meeting, Dr. Baker executed the agreement in order for
the work to begin. Your requested approval will ratify his signature.
Mr. Cowan will be available to answer any questions.

Explanation of Issue:
As you know, shortly after we sold the first set of bonds associated with our successful $160M bond issue we began initial work associated
with several projects. While most of this work can be completed by staff, from time to time we need additional capacity and expertise to
move this large body of work forward.
We propose to utilize the Construction Services Group from ESD 112 to assist us on an as needed basis for various bond program support
including scheduling, estimating, budgeting, consultant selection, OSPI interface, etc. as enumerated in the attached agreement.This is the
same group that provided outstanding service to the district during the Facility Task Force work last year.

2.12 Authorize Negotiations for Lowell Improvements
Architect

Meeting :

Feb 27, 2014 - Regular School Board Meeting with
Study Session

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff has requested approval to begin contract negotiations
with Dykeman Architects in connection with the Lowell
Elementary School construction project. As Superintendent,
I support this request and am submitting it for approval as a
consent item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
RCW 39.80.040 governs the process for selecting architects. One option is to select a firm from an annual general request for statements of
qualifications from interested firms.
After reviewing the statements of qualifications from interested firms who responded to our annual request, I believe Dykeman Architects is
best qualified to provide services for our Lowell project. Dykeman has past successful experience and knowledge of Lowell when they
served as lead architect for the Lowell Seismic improvements. This prior knowledge will serve the district and them well in designing the
Lowell improvements as they are familiar with existing design elements which we will attempt to match with the improvements; they are
familiar with the existing structural system at Lowell which will be impacted by the installation of an elevator; and it will enable them to begin
work sooner than if we were to employ another firm.
I am seeking your approval to begin contract negotiations with Dykeman for services related to the Lowell project.

Mr. Cowan will be available to answer any questions.
