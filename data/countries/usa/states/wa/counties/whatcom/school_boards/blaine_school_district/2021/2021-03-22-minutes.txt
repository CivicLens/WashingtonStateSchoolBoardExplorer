  D. Superintendent's Report
Dr. Christopher Granger provided an update which included information on the following topics.
Legislative Work: Legislative bills were reviewed related to school funding, as well as graduation waivers which are not expected to continue in future years.
Staffing: Although staffing reductions are included in the district's Reduced Education Plan, Dr. Granger expects most, if not all, impacted positions to be reassigned to other areas under ESSER funding. Director McKinney asked if other reductions are anticipated and discussion followed. If the allowance for 3-foot distancing does not come to fruition, the district may experience further decreased enrollment.
Budget Planning: The budget planning timeline was reviewed.
2021-2022 School Year: The use of masks and some kind of social distancing will still be required next year. Dr. Granger explained that recent CDC guidance allowing 3-foot distancing in the classroom does not include extend to all areas of the school (i.e. PE, cafeteria, band, choir, etc.).
Mt. Baker Foundation: Dr. Granger described the funding provided by the Mt. Baker Foundation which will be used by the Family Service Center to meet the needs of families experiencing hardship. He expressed appreciation for the excellent support being provided by Whatcom County and the Foundation for families in need during the pandemic.
Board Election: An information session will be scheduled for anyone interested in running for an open school board position. Director Thomas will take part in that session.
Equity Group: Dr. Granger shared information about the first meeting of the district's equity group.
Superintendent Advisory Committee: The formation of a Superintendent's Advisory Committee for next year will be promoted during high school announcements.
Facility Use: Non-school youth sports have been using the district's outdoor areas, following rules related to record retention, attestation, and scheduling.
Guidance Update: OSPI has approved the district's reopening plan update which was submitted on March 1st. The template for the plan due on June 1st has not been provided yet, but the board can anticipate reviewing it at the May meeting. Graduation ceremony guidance was released today and will be reviewed. Director McKinney suggested seeking input from senior families about what components of graduation they would consider to be critical. Dr. Granger explained that there will be a Q&A session for senior families, but options would be determined by Whatcom County's phase at the time of graduation, so planning cannot be finalized until the end of May.

Upcoming Events: Director Thomas will listen in on the March 29 Community Q&A at 6pm.

  7. Board Comments and Future Meeting(s)
A. General Comments
Director Thomas asked for input from the other directors regarding any information they wish they would have known when considering service on the board. Director McKinney shared comments on the importance of being a school board member for the purpose of engaging in public service and not with an expectation of addressing any single item of concern. President Gibson concurred and commented on the school board being one of the first grassroots opportunities for representative government at a local level. Prospective directors must understand that the board speaks and acts as a unit, not as individuals.

Director McKinney provided further comments on the CDC's new distancing guidance and stated, on the record, that the board's commitment is to support students by following the rules and procedures laid out for us and by working through the system to get students back into full-time in-person learning for the 2021-2022 school year.
