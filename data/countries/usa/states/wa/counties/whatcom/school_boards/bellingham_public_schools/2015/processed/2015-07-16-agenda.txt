Explanation of Issue:
On June 27, 2013, the board adopted Resolution 14-13 which, among other things, specified the eligible
capital improvements that could be implemented using proceeds from the 2013 bond issue. The purpose
of this evening's public hearing is to take public testimony, both for and against a proposed amendment
to Resolution 14-13 that will add the acquisition or construction of a new warehouse and portable
classrooms to the list of eligible capital improvements associated with the 2013 bond issue.
The acquisition or construction of a new district warehouse was not one of the specified projects in
Resolution 14-13. The new warehouse was mentioned in the resolution as a project but it was anticipated
that the funding source would be the State ConstructionAssistance Program (SCAP). However,SCAP
funds will not be received in time for the construction of a new warehouse before demolition begins on
the existing warehouse to make room for the construction of the new Options High School beginning in
June 2016. The proposed amendment to Resolution 14-13 will allow bond proceeds to be used for a new
district warehouse. This will allow the district to acquire or build a new warehouse immediately and 'be
out of the way' by the time construction of the new Options begins. SCAP funds will be used for other
listed bond projects as was originally stated in Resolution 14-13.

In addition, Resolution 14-13 did not include any provision for the acquisition of portable classrooms. With
the prospect of additional future state funding for lower class size, it is likely the district will acquire
additional portables for more classroom space to take advantage of the additional funding. The proposed
revision to Resolution 14-13 will allow bond proceeds to be used for portable classrooms.
RCW 28A.530.020 requires a public hearing prior to amending the list of eligible projects associated with
a bond issue.
This public hearing will be followed by a regular board meeting, beginning at 6:15, during which the board
will take action on the proposed amendment.
