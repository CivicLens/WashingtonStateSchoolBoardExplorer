Re: Spring 2024 School Board School Updates
_________________________________________
Earlier this fall, the decision was made to not have each school publicly present their School Improvement Plan in light
of so much emotion and confusion related to possible school closure and consolidation facing our community. Now
that we are no longer considering school closure or consolidation, and instead are back on track with the great work
happening in schools, each of our seven BISD schoolswill attend a board meeting this spring to highlight the amazing
experiences of their students and steadfast dedication and tremendous talent of their staff.

Re: MTSS Update
___________________________________________________________
At the May 30th Board meeting Briley Proctor, Lee Pruett, Amy Jernigan and Annie Sitzenstock will present an update on MTSS
in the BISD.
Specifically, the presentation will focus on systems-level progress made to date, as well as the readiness for use of the dual
discrepancy model when identifying a specific learning disability.
As previously presented over the last three years, in 2028 legislation will be enacted that changes the way in which students are
identified as having a specific learning disability in the state of Washington. Although this mandated change will not be in place
for a few more years,we have worked methodically to create lasting MTSS systems and structures in anticipation of this
monumental change.
This agenda item is information only and does not require Board action.

Re: 2024-2028 Conference Dates, 2025-26 and 2026-27 Calendars
____________________________________________________________
At the May 30th Board meeting, I will present K-6 fall conference dates and K-8 winter conference dates for the next three school
years, 2024-2028. While this does not require board approval, I am bringing forth these dates forward in order to provide an
overview of how dates were decided collaboratively between BISD(Bainbridge Island School District) and BIEA (Bainbridge
Island Education Association) leadership, with instructional planning for students being our core areas of focus.
Additionally, I will be bringing the 2025-26 and 2026-27 calendars before the Board for your review and approval. These
calendars were created collaborativelyby BISD and BIEA leadership and followed obligations set forth by the BIEA CBA
(Collective Bargaining Agreement).
I recommend the board approve the 2025-26 and 2026-27 school year calendars.

Re: Superintendent Evaluation Process
____________________________________________
At the May 30th Board meeting, I will present the process being enacted for my superintendent evaluation in the 2023-24 and
2024-25 school years. This process was created collaboratively by myself and the board of directors at our last two Board
Retreats.
It is important to note that this process closely aligns with the evaluation process that is utilized for classified staff,
certificatedstaff and building administrators. The WSSDA (Washington State School Directors Association) worked to create a
standards-based framework that reflects best practice and allows for parallel language to be used when discussing areas for
growthand improvement.
The purpose of this presentation is for me to model transparent leadership to staff, students and the community as the lead
learner of our organization. Additionally, I believe it is important for the community at large to have an understanding about the
superintendentevaluation process, including the self-assessment reflection, and specific goal areas set for growth and
improvement.
The outcome of my evaluation will be presented at the July 27, 2024 Board meeting.

Per Policy 6881 the board must declare district property obsolete and or surplus prior to sale, trade, or disposal. I am requesting
that the board approve the attached list of items as surplus so that we may move forward with their sale or disposal. After the
items are declared surplus we will notify local private schools and other public schools that we have surplus items available.
Items not sold to other private or public schools will be made available for purchase by the general public.

I recommend the board approve the surplus of all equipment in the attached list for sale, and disposal.

Re: Policy 2163 Multi-Tiered Systems of Support/Response to Intervention First Reading
_____________________________________________________________________
I am bringing forward the first reading of a new policy, policy 2163: Multi-Tiered Systems of Support/Response to Intervention.
While the district has been building our Multi-Tiered Systems of Support for the last few years, we have not yet adopted a policy
or procedure that describes the Response to Intervention Process. Policy 2163 describes the process by which the district will
identify students challenges early and intervene when necessary by implementing scientific, research-based interventions in the
general education setting, measuring students response to intervention, and using data about response to intervention in order
to inform instruction and intervention. A committee of educators will work on creating the procedure for this policy so that there
are clear and explicit instructions for how to implement Response to Intervention practices with the intent to identify Specific
Learning Disabilities in the area of Reading through the RTI process in the 2024-2025 school year. Identification of SLD in
Reading will be the first step toward identifying all Specific Learning Disabilities through an RTI process by 2028. Procedure
2162 will also be modified to reflect the change in procedure of identifying Specific Learning Disability in Reading through the
RTI process for school year 2024-2025.
I request the approval of Policy 2163 Multi-Tiered Systems of Support/Response to Intervention First reading.

Attached for your review is a second reading of Policy 1250, School Board Student Members. We did receive one requested
change from the Board which was to open up this opportunity to any high school student and not just juniors and seniors. We
have made such change.

I recommend the Board approve this policy. There will be a forthcoming procedure document that will further flesh out this

Small Works Capital Projects
DA Hogan and Associates are refining multiple design concepts of the Central Campus Athletic Complex for Capital
Committee review during the 2023/2024 school year.
The Long-Range Facilities Planning Committee held another successful meeting on May 15th, preceded by two
community engagement sessions held on May 13th. Capital staff and the Mithun Design team provided an overview of
feedback from the community engagement session, followed by multiple group activities designed to engage committee
members in prioritizing potential long-term projects district-wide.
NW Lift and Equipment has completed pouring of the base slabs and pit walls of the new bus lift system at transportation.
Crews from NW Lift are preparing to install plumbing and electrical conduit for the lift mechanisms, as well as preparation
for the pouring of the finished slab. The project is approximately three weeks ahead of schedule.
Permits for the Woodward Middle School Restroom Renovation Project have been submitted to COBI for review. Capital
staff are working with architects and consultants to prepare bid documents and a competitive request for proposals to
local contractors.

In preparation for potential future district-wide projects, Capital staff are working to research and develop district
standards related to solar applications that will allow the district to experience utility savings in the future. Part of this
research will include the compilation and categorization of various grant opportunities available at both the state and
federal levels.
Capital Projects and Facilities staff have initiated a new exploratory committee focused on Bus Fleet Electrification and
the necessary infrastructure components to successfully deploy an electric fleet.
Transportation
New Bus #02 is still in Pasco and scheduled to arrive at the end of May
Transportation staff are reviewing applications for the recently vacated Driver Trainer position.
Operations
The Woodward Middle School locker removal project is scheduled to be completed over the summer months with tile
replacement and acoustic wall treatments already well underway.
Maintenance staff are identifying priorities and preparing work plans for the summer months.
Grounds staff are preparing for various events taking place in the month of June such as eighth-grade banquet and high
school graduation.

district Technology Services salaries partially paid out of the General Fund have now been moved to the Technology Levy
budget. Outside of repair costs and network security & maintenance renewals, there are no major expenditures to report since
that last report.
