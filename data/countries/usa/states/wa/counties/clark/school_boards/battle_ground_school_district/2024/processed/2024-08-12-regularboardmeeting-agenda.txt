the recommended curriculum for
Grades K-6. Go Math HMH Publishers. Copyright 2018.
This is a 6 year adoption.
Grades 7-8. Go Math HMH Publishers. Copyright 2018.
This is a 1 year adoption.

Public Content
Background:

Because of the many instructional delivery models, the K-8 district's adopted math curriculum (Bridges and Illustrative Mathematics) has had
many challenging components to implement as designed. To offset these challenges, RHL has used Go Math, first as a supplemental
curriculum and then as a pilot program, for the past two years. They now propose to adopt it as the core math curriculum.
Grades 7 and 8 are one year because the company will discontinue the 7th/8th-grade program at the end of next year. RHL will use the
program for one year and work on finding a replacement program for the remaining five years. The K-6 program will be available and
supported by the company for the full six years of the contract.
This proposal has the endorsement of the Instructional Materials Committee (IMC), which states that the adoption process has met all
requirements of Board Policy 2020 and Procedure 2020P for CTE curricula.

Background:
Amergis Healthcare Staffing (formerly Maxim Healthcare Staffing Services) has been providing temporary district healthcare and special

qualified candidates. The contracted staffing Amergis provides would normally be district employees. Weve reached out to several
contractors, and this vendor was able to meet our needs in a timely manner. Lowest cost was not a factor in our decision because costs are
comparable between staffing agencies. This contract is for district-wide healthcare and special education staffing services for unfilled
positions for the 2024-25 school year. This contract is for $600,000 and is based on projected expenditures.
