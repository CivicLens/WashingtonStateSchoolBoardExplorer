STAFF RECOMMENDS APPROVING ORDINANCE NO. 2408 - AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF PULLMAN, WHITMAN COUNTY, WASHINGTON,
RELATING TO PROCUREMENT, REVISING SECTIONS
1.107 TO THE PULLMAN CITY CODE AND OTHER
MATTERS PROPERLY RELATED THERETO.

Public Content
The Washington State Legislature modified small works contracting requirements
with SSHB 5268 in April 2023 which is to become effective July 1, 2024. The previous
resolution considered by the Pullman City Council to adopt these changes will require
an update to Pullman City Code 1.107 for Procurement.
Along with these required legislative changes, the Washington State Auditors Office
recommends that purchasing and procurement policies be regularly reviewed as a
form of internal controls and best practices.
Although additions have been made recently to PCC 1.107, the change in the small
works roster item and the effects of pricing caused by recent inflation have prompted
staff to take a more holistic approach in this review. As such, the entire code was
assessed and several updates are being recommended.
All updates are presented in tracking mode. Some highlights include:
Grammar changes from city to City
Presenting pronouns as gender neutral
Identifying job title change from 2018 of Finance Director to the Director of
Finance & Administrative Services

Edit purchasing authority thresholds previously established in 2017 to better
address market conditions, create operational efficiencies, and recognize
concurrence with legislative intent
Codify the institution and growth of Public Purchasing Cooperatives
Replace prior Small Works Roster operations language with language
commensurate with new legislation
Provide additional clarification around Consulting and Professional Services

Recommended Action :

Staff recommends a motion to approve the installation
contract as submitted to move forward with the Fire
Department Paging System project.

Public Content
The scope of the project includesinstalling all station alerting equipment furnished by
the Fire Department inaccordance with the manufacturer's specifications of the
designed system and according to applicable code requirements. Fidelity Solutions
will connect all the equipment to the central control panel within each station and will
program the station system as per the design and operational requirements of the
Department. Fidelity Solutions will work with appropriaterepresentatives to establish
the connection with the dispatch center and will fully test thesystem to ensure desired
functionality. Fidelity Solutions warranty our workmanship for 180 days and will work
with the manufacturer to ensure that the manufacturer warranty is maintained and
utilized, if necessary.
In accordance with the City of Pullman procurement policies, the fire department will
be purchasing paging system equipment directly from US Digital Designs, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Honeywell, which has a solicitation contract with NPP.Gov of
which the City of Pullman is a member.

The 2023 Capital Improvement Committee approved $251,000 for this project. The
initial estimates for equipment for both stations and the dispatch center was
approximately $182,844, and the initial installation estimate was approximately
$45,711.Due to inflation, increased labor costs, and other factors the installation bid
came in approx. $35,015.59 over the initial estimate. Fire Department staff are
currently exploring grant opportunities as well as partnerships to offset the cost
difference. Department staff are confident if they do not receive grant funding for this
project they will be able to absorb the difference through the budgetary process.

Recommended Action :

By motion, adopt the attached resolution authorizing
submittal of a Transportation Improvement Board grant
application for the Orchard Drive & Valley Road Resurfacing
project and authorizing acceptance and execution of the
grant agreement if awarded.

Public Content
The Washington State Transportation Improvement Board (TIB) has an annual funding program
called the Arterial Preservation Program (APP). The 2024 call for projects was announced on
May 20, 2024, with all applications due on August 9, 2024.
City staff would like to apply for funding for the Orchard Drive & Valley Road Resurfacing
project, which proposes a 2-inch grind and inlay on Orchard Drive from its intersection with
Stadium Way near Beasley Coliseum continuing northeast and north until Orchard Drive turns
west and becomes Valley Road, just west of the WSU Student Recreation Center. The
resurfacing project continues along Valley Road to its intersection with Cove Way.
This fall, WSU is completing a sidewalk & path replacement project along a portion of this
stretch of road. Because of that project, six out of nine ADA ramp upgrades that would be
required for the resurfacing project will already have been completed.
City staff completed the conceptual design of the project in advance of this year's grant
application deadline.If successful, the grant application would provide funds for the City to
advance the project beyond the current conceptual design by finalizing the design, plans, and
specifications, as well as construction of the project in 2025. The attached grant application is in
draft form. Staff will prepare and gather the remaining required attachments & signatures and
may still make a few final revisions prior to the submittal deadline.
Staff anticipates that TIB will announce project selections by early December and, if awarded,
will immediately work to prepare and execute all associated grant paperwork to keep the project
moving forward effectively and on schedule for construction in 2025. The grant will cover up to
85% of the eligible project costs, with the Arterial Street Fund covering the resulting 15% City
match (estimated at $74,029.00). The amount of funds being requested from TIB for this project
is $348,664.
Staff is requesting the adoption, by motion, of the attached resolution to execute the grant
application as well as authorize the acceptance and execution of the grant agreement, if
awarded.
