I am requesting permission for 18 staff from Kulshan and Shuksan middle schools, Squalicum High
School and Central Services to attend the AVID Summer Institute in Sacramento, California, July 1216,
2010.
AVID stands for Advancement Via Individual Determination and is a college preparedness program for
students who would not traditionally have college as a future goal. Shuksan is currently in its third year of
implementation, Squalicum in its second year, and Kulshan will transition into AVID next fall.
Training provided at this conference will enhance each teachers competence in the delivery of the AVID
elective program. Additionally, administrators and counselors will become proficient in their ability to

support AVID teachers and students. Costs associated with this training will be paid through a
combination of Title II, ISD and building funds.
Thank you for considering this request.

June 18 - June 20, 2010. The team of 7 8 players will participate in the UW Team Camp, staying in the

with funds raised during last seasons free-throw-a-thon event. The dorm fee is $50.00 for two nights and
will be paid by the players on an individual basis. Financial hardship will not prevent an athlete from
participating. Coach Wright will drive a school van; parent volunteers will drive private cars if needed.
Mark Wright will supervise the athletes throughout the trip.
I support Mark Wrights request to attend this camp and believe it will provide the instruction and
competition needed to build a strong team for 2010-2011.

Explanation of Issue: Student Trip - Shuksan Middle School Science Trip
Shuksan principal, Andy Mark is requesting permission in concept for Shuksan 6 and 7 grade students to
participate in the Salish Sea Expeditions Science Trip aboard the sailing vessel Carlyn, June 1-3, 2010.
The purpose of the trip is to conduct scientific inquiry and explore a marine environment. The vessel is
fully insured and bonded.
If approved in concept, students would like to begin fundraising activities to help pay for the trip. Every
student will be allowed to attend, even in the event of financial hardship.
I recommend approval of this trip in concept as outlined in the attached information.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TO: Doug Kyles, Executive Director of School Administration
FROM: Andy Mark, Principal, Shuksan Middle School
DATE: March 29, 2010
RE: Salish Sea Expeditions Science Field Trip
Seventh and sixth grade science teachers, Sarah Walker and Wendy Born would like to take a group of
approximately 27 students to conduct on-board inquiry based science derived from student generated
predictions aboard the Salish Sea Expeditions Science, a three-day trip aboard a 61 foot sailing vessel in
the San Juan Islands. The trip would last three days, and two nights. There would be at least three adult
chaperones attending with the 27 students. The trip would be June 1-3, 2010.
Aboard the Carlyn, students design and conduct scientific inquiry while learning how to sail and explore
the marine environment. Students engage in real life field science by designing and conducting an
investigation of their interest and design. Additionally students will have the once-in-a-lifetime chance of
navigating the ocean in a 61 foot yawl.
Students will pay approximately $200 each for the transportation, meals and activity costs. This cost
reflects a scholarship offered by Salish Sea Expeditions to cover half of the total cost of the trip. All
students will be eligible to help fundraise to pay for their trip, though any student unable to private pay or

fundraise due to personal circumstances, or other hardship, can apply for a scholarship.
The trip offers students a science experience that is not possible in the classroom or even through local
field trips. The dynamic fieldbased science aboard the Carlyn encourages students to apply what they are
learning in life science and earth science to the greater Puget Sound.
I believe our Shuksan Middle School students will benefit from the activities Ms. Walker and Ms. Born
have tentatively planned. With more than 57% of our students receiving free or reduced lunch, I am
convinced that a rare few have ever had this type of opportunity in the past.

college students.
Lisa and one other chaperone will accompany and supervise students at the institute. Students will travel

4.02 Public Hearing for Proposed Use of Student
Achievement (I-728) Funds for 2010-11

Meeting :

Apr 22, 2010 - Regular Meeting 7:30 p.m.

Type :

Reports

Public Content
Acting Superintendent's
Recommendation: The law requires a public hearing on the proposed use of I-728 funds for the
following year on or before May 1. Use of I-728 funds will be included in the 201011 Bellingham School
District budget when it is presented later this year for Board approval. Board action is not required at this
time.
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Assistant Superintendent for Business and Operations

Explanation of Issue:
The attached spreadsheet provides financial information related to our use of Student Achievement (I728) funds, including actual expenditures for 2008-09, budgeted and projected actual expenditures for
2009-10, and budgeted expenditures for 2010-11. As you know, I-728 funds may only be used for
specific purposes; including class size reduction, extended learning opportunities, professional
development, pre-kindergarten activities, and facility improvements related to class size reductions or
extended learning opportunities. Historically, our district has utilized these funds in the areas of class size
reduction, professional development, and extended learning opportunities.
Over the past month I consulted with principals at all levels, the leadership team, and the central
administrative team to review the existing use of I-728 funds and to seek input on additional district needs
that could possibly be addressed through the use of I-728 funds. As a result of those discussions, and the
fact that the legislature eliminated all new funding for I-728 in 2010-11, I am recommending the following
priorities for the use of our I-728 carryover funds for 2010-11:
1. Additional certificated staff FTE to reduce class size.
2. Summer School activities corresponding to the Budget Savings Plan. (Extended Learning)
3. Extended Learning opportunities for grades 9-12 at Options High School.
4. All day kindergarten activities in the event the tuition structure does not fully cover the cost of the
program. (Extended Learning)
5. Indirect cost activities at a maximum of 5%.

These are the same priorities and activities as 2009-10, with a slight increase in class size reduction
activities associated with Reading and Math.
It is important to note that unless the legislature restores some/all funding for I-728 for the 2011-12 school
year, we will be forced to make drastic reductions to our class size reduction and extended learning
activities during the 2011-12 school year.
Other than providing an opportunity for any person to appear or, by written submission, comment on the
proposed use of I-728 funds for 2010-11, no action is required by the Board. You will adopt the specific I728 plan when you adopt the 2010-11 Bellingham School District budget later this year.
