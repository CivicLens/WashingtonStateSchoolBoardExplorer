Both teachers have arranged for top quality substitutes to take their place and have arranged their absences so they have minimal impact on
their students.
To my mind, being an AP reader is the absolute best type of professional development we can offer these young teachers. They will be
reading and scoring all of the countrys AP exams with other AP teachers from all around the country. It is the ultimate in learning the true
power of common assessments. Both of these teachers are committed to their profession and are reflective educators dedicated to professional
growth.

I am writing this letter of support Squalicum Cheer Students to attend a four-day NCA Summer Camp hosted in Grand Mound, WA. The
camp takes place from June 27through 30, 2011. This camp will provide exclusive coaching from professional NCA staff and will also
provide our squad with new materials and new skills. It is anticipated that 20 cheerleaders will be attending, along with the advisor and two
chaperones.
The cost of the camp is $325 per cheerleader, $425 for the coach/advisor, and $390 per chaperone. Registration, meals, hotel and travel will
be covered by individual families and organized fundraising. Scholarships are available for students if needed.
