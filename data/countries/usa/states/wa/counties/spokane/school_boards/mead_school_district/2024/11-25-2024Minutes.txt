Remarks for the Good of the Schools – Public Comment on Agenda Items
President Cannon first opened the floor for high school ASB updates. This was followed by
board/staff comments and then Public Comment on Agenda Items.
High School Reports
Mt. Spokane High School - ASB President Jayson Bonnett presented a brief review of the
academic, athletic, leadership and music events recently completed and upcoming at Mt.
Spokane High School. Casey Bruce was the keynote speaker for the recent Veterans Day
Assembly. ASB just hosted the second Rep Assembly of the year where counselor Josh Cowart
spoke with students about leadership. Slow Pitch Softball won the state 3A championship,
Volleyball placed 3rd at state and Soccer (girls) was 4th. Plans are underway for the Catmania
basketball games taking place during Christmas Break at Mead High School. Winter sports have
started and elections for next year’s (25/26) ASB officers will take place right after Christmas
Break.
Mead High School – No one from the Mead High School ASB class was in attendance.
Board/Staff Comments
Director Gray, who had the opportunity to attend a couple of Veterans Day events, noted each
of those schools did a very nice job honoring veterans. She also noted the app that allows the
monitoring of student web activity is an excellent new tool for parents.
Director Killman, who has a son who plays football for Mead High School, noted it has been a
very successful season for the team. They qualified for state and competed in two playoff games.

President Cannon, who also had the opportunity to attend Veterans Day events, echoed the
positive comments shared by Director Gray and noted, in particular, the honoring/moving nature
of the celebration at Shiloh Hills. He additionally referenced the many concerts that take place
throughout the year, where hundreds of musicians are featured, and gave a “shout out” to
performing arts staff for their excellent work with these students.
Regarding the Mead High School football program, on behalf of the board, President Cannon
read the following statement:
Last Wednesday, November 20th, the Mead School District was served with a lawsuit
containing several concerning allegations relating to incidents and issues associated with
the Mead High School football program.
The items brought to light in this claim are deeply concerning, and we take these allegations
seriously. This Board has no greater responsibility than ensuring the safety and well-being
of our students.
We will respond appropriately to this suit, according to three principles.
Our first principle is accountability. Although many of the events described in this suit are
known to the district and have been previously investigated, we are carefully reviewing the
newest claim. Seeing that there are new details and allegations, it is vital that we
understand what exactly happened and where we can improve going forward.
Our second principle is accuracy. We cannot act based on allegations alone. We must get
ahold of the facts. We are committed to establishing the facts through an independent
investigation, ensuring a thorough and impartial review of the situation.
Our third principle is transparency. As a public institution, we have a responsibility to keep
our community informed. We will provide updates as more information becomes available
while respecting the privacy of those involved and the integrity of the investigative process.
Public Comments on Agenda Items
NOTE: To listen to comments in their entirety please visit www.mead354.org/board where a link
to the Zoom recording of the meeting is posted.
Patrick Sheehy addressed the board regarding the proposed revisions to Procedure 2190, Highly
Capable Programs. Mr. Sheehy is the father of a second grade daughter who is a Mead School
District student. This is the third meeting in a row he has brought forward concerns regarding
the district’s Highly Capable Program. He referenced Robin Placzek’s October 21, 2024 Highly
Capable Program report to the board and pointed out this presentation and Procedure 2190 are
fundamentally different and, therefore, following one means defying the other. He warned that
district staff have been blatantly disregarding state law and asked that the board hold staff
accountable. He requested the revision to Procedure 2190 not be approved until it actually
complies with state law.

Continuing Business
A.
Consent Agenda A – 2nd Reading Policy/Procedure Adoptions & Revisions
Consent Agenda A contains policies and procedures that were presented for first reading, nonaction, consideration on October 21, 2024. President Cannon confirmed all five
policies/procedures could be brought forward for second reading adoption/action via Consent
Agenda on November 25, 2024.

Family & Student Services Director Josh Westermann briefly reviewed Policy/Procedure 2162,
Education of Students With Disabilities Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This
would be a new policy/procedure for the district.
Per a request from Director Nolan, each policy/procedure was voted on separately.
Director Nolan made a motion to adopt Policy/Procedure 2162, Education of Students With
Disabilities Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as presented. Director Gray
seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously.
Director Nolan made a motion to adopt Policy 2411, High School Equivalency Certificate, as
presented. Director Gray seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously.
Director Nolan made a motion to adopt Policy 2230, Transition to Kindergarten Program, as
presented. Director Gray seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously.
Following discussion around the COVID reference in the policy, and notation that when this
section is no longer applicable the policy will need to be revised, Director Gray made a motion
adopt Policy 2108, Learning Assistance Program, as presented. Director Killman seconded the
motion. The motion carried unanimously.

Highly Capable Programs. Director Killman seconded the motion. The motion carried
unanimously.
B.
Bond Refunding
Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson briefly reviewed bond refunding information that was
shared at the November 4th Work Session. Bonds (approximately $40,000,000) issued in 2015 are
eligible for refunding/refinancing 90 days before June 1, 2025. The net projected savings to tax
payers, based on current interest rates, is $4.2 million. Bond refunding/refinancing reduces taxes
paid by local taxpayers. It does not generate any new revenue for the school district.
Following discussion, the board indicated support for Ms. Ellingson to move forward with
preparation of the refunding resolution. Bond refunding will be an agenda item at the January
9, 2025 Work Session with resolution adoption planned as an action item on January 27, 2025.

Student Travel Proposal
Mead High School Jazz Band
Jeff Naslund, Director of Secondary Education, presented a travel request from Mead High School
Jazz I (approximately 20 students), Band Director Rob Lewis, and additional adult chaperones
sufficient to provide a 4:1adult-to-student ratio, to travel to Denton, Texas, January 27-30, 2025,
to participate in the University of North Texas Jazz Residency. This trip will provide students
with the opportunity to:
•
•

Learn from students and faculty of the renowned One O’Clock Lab Band at the University
of North Texas, considered the top collegiate jazz program in the world.
Engage in master classes and sectionals, as well as serve as the opening band for a One
O’Clock Lab Band concert.

The trip itinerary also includes visits to educational and cultural sites in the Dallas/Fort Worth
area.
Students will miss 3-4 days of school (January 27th is a snow make-up day) and Rob Lewis will
need a substitute teacher for those same days.
The estimated per student cost is $560 with funds available via fundraising to help offset the
cost.
Director Nolan referenced wanting to revisit the district’s student travel policy, noting in
particular the 12:1 student to chaperone ratio and the importance of making sure, if both male
and female students are traveling, that an appropriate number of mixed gender chaperones are
also going on the trip.
Director Gray made a motion to approve the request from Mead High School Jazz I to travel to
Denton, Texas, January 27-30, 2025, to participate in the University of North Texas Jazz
Residency, as presented. Director Killman seconded the motion. The motion carried
unanimously.

Reports
A.
2023/24 Year End Financial Report
Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson, prior to presenting the 2023/24 Year End Financial
Report, noted it typically takes 6-8 weeks for the district to finalize the books before sending
year end financials to the ESD for review. Following this review the information is forwarded to
OSPI. Each year, in the spring, prior school year financal reports are audited. The district’s full
23/24 financial report should be available/posted soon on the OSPI website.
2023/24 financial report highlights (General Fund) included the following:
•
•
•
•

Enrollment was 83.71 FTE below budget.
Just over $1 million was used from fund balance. This is significantly less than the $5.5
million that was projected/budgeted for.
Revenue was $2.6 million higher than projected and expenditures were $1.8 million less
than projected. Information shared included the revenue/expenditure variance by
program.
Fund balance information shared included an ending total fund balance of $11,802,453
of which $1,946,746 is unassigned (1.18%). Per board policy the unassigned percentage
goal is 8.33%.

President Cannon, while thankful the district did not end up spending $5.5 million out of fund
balance as projected, noted expenditures still exceeded revenue by $1 million in the 2023/24
school year.
B.
Financial Report for September & October 2024
Chief Financial Officer Heather Ellingson presented a brief financial report for the months of
September and October 2024. Report highlights included the following:
•

•
•

Enrollment is 429.4 FTE over budget. This is approximately 100 FTE higher than where
the district ended last year. Ms. Ellingson reminded enrollment was intentionally
budgeted low for 2024/25 based on lower than anticipated enrollment in the previous
school year. The district’s monthly state apportionment amount won’t include the money
for higher than budgeted enrollment until January.
A graph illustrating enrollment trends for the current and past four school years was
shared.
Using a bar graph, year-to-year cash balance and fund balance information was reviewed.

In response to a question from Director Nolan, Ms. Ellingson explained student enrollment is
verified on the first school day of each month with the exception of at the start of the school
year when “count day” is the 4th day of school.
In closing, Ms. Ellingson shared levy certification information for the 2025 calendar year. The
certified tax rate will be $2.50 based on the 2025 assessed valuation of $11.5 billion.

In conclusion, Mr. Davis noted that Fall 24/25 ridership of 7213 is the highest since COVID and
additionally shared that efficiencies have been improved primarily because of revisions to
routes.
D.
Superintendent’s Report
In addition to noting the many accomplishments of both Mead High School and Mt. Spokane
High School athletic teams this fall, Superintendent Hanson, regarding performing arts, noted
both high school Theatre Arts departments just concluded successful runs of their fall play
productions. The Winter Concert season starts after Thanksgiving Break. A listing of concerts
taking place throughout the district can be found on the district’s website.
Regarding Veterans Day, he shared an email from a patron who expressed appreciation for the
beautiful/meaningful celebration they attended.
In conclusion, Superintendent Hanson, referencing the recent car accident that resulted in the
death of a Mead High School student, acknowledged the amazing work of the district’s Crisis
Team. Whenever a tragedy strikes this team, led by Josh Westermann and Stacy Cornwell, is on
site to support students and staff.
VIII. Remarks for the Good of the Schools – Public Comment on Non-Agenda Items
NOTE: The name of each speaker is listed below, along with the topic they commented on and a
very brief summary of their remarks. The speaker’s affiliation to the district, if any, is also
indicated. To listen to comments in their entirety please visit www.mead354.org/board where a
link to the Zoom recording of the meeting is posted.
Angela Johnstone, a 1980 Mead High School graduate and mother of two Mead School District
graduates, who is also a retired Special Education Director (Spokane Public Schools),
shared/reminded that school districts receive funding for special education students from two
categories. They are funded as “basic education” students and also additional special education
funding is received for each student. When applicable, the district may also receive additional
CTE monies for the students who are taking CTE classes.
Jason VanFredenberg, a Mead School District electrician (7 years), spoke on behalf of fellow
members of the Mead Combined Trades Association. The MCTA contract expired on August 31,
2024. In particular he referenced the 3.7% IPD that many employees in the district received but
has not been offered to MCTA members. He shared that trades employees at Spokane Public
Schools received the full IPD and noted the cost to the district to do that for MCTA members
would be $82,300. Receiving the full IPD would simply help trades employees keep up – they
would not be getting ahead. Without a competitive wage it will be hard for the district to attract
and retain good employees. The group as a whole feels disrespected.
In closing, he presented the board with signatures from 800 employees/community members
who support MCTA. The group feels both they and Mead School District students are worth the
investment.
IX.
Executive Session
