Superintendent.

Worksession Discussion:

Discussion was held regarding the budget for 2014-2015. Since enrollment has been declining each
year, Mr. Heid suggested that next year’s budget be prepared using an estimated enrollment total
between 870-875 total students.
The Board received a request from the NEWS organization asking for additional funding support to
continue its efforts for full implementation of the McCleary Case decision from the Washington
State Supreme Court. After discussion, a letter of support will be prepared rather than any
financial contribution.
Discussion was held about the procedure that allows low-income high school students to
participate in community service or school work in lieu of paying the fee for an ASB card. Mr. Heid
will research how the hours worked are tracked and if a student would be required to have a
state-issued work permit for this purpose.
Since the former school attorney has retired, Mr. Heid suggested the school district contract with
Jeanie Tolcacher for any legal services needed.
There was discussion about pre-kindergarten readiness programs. Mr. Heid recommended that
the district begin parent/child education workshops next fall for Pre-K families at the primary
school.
Discussion was held regarding the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 drafted school calendars. The Board
preferred changing some of the vacation and snow make-up days and will consider adoption at the
next regular board meeting.
Discussion was held regarding coaching personnel. Mr. Heid will email the Board when decisions
are finalized regarding changes to coach personnel.
Board members requested that the parent bulletins from the schools be sent to them.
Discussion was held regarding areas of the track that need attention by the maintenance
department. The stadium bleacher space should also be reviewed for proper building code
requirements.
The evaluation of the Superintendent was finalized.

Adjournment:

There being no further discussion, Mr. Conroy adjourned the meeting at 8:00 p.m.
