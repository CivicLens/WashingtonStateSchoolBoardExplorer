N. Regular Agenda
City Administrator Mike Urban, Finance Director Jeff Elbracht, and Public Works Director
Sean Wells explained that due to actions with the Washington Pollution Control Hearings
Board (PCHB) and associated activities by the Washington State Department of Ecology
(DOE), the City of Pullman cannot at this time land apply biosolids as per past practices,
further making future activities unclear. Unlike September 2023, a State of Emergency
does not exist, and a contingency plan is in place that is prepared to be activated.
As part of this contingency plan, the only option left to the City of Pullman Sewer Utility
consumers is to haul these biosolids to composting facilities in Lewiston, ID, and Airway
Heights, WA, for further treatment and final disposal. The yearly costs are expected to
be approximately $300,000, which is not budgeted.
Resolution No. R-50-24 recommends that the City Council adopt a Temporary Biosolids
Fee for sewer utility consumers to account for these unanticipated expenses and that the
fee remain in place beginning with activities starting August 1, 2024, until further
clarification from the State Department of Ecology is provided.
Washington State University (WSU) is a ratepayer, and as per the existing contract,
36.4% of this expense will be attributable to those operations. As such, additional
language is included in the resolution to codify this expense.
The proposed fees for other consumers are:

Monthly Base Fee
$ 2.97
$ 4.46

Monthly Fee per
CCF
$ 0.048
$ 0.048

Multi Family
Duplex

$ 4.46
$ 4.46

$ 0.048
N/A

Single Family Residence

$ 2.97

N/A

Account Type
Small Commercial Meters ( ≤ 1”)
Larger Commercial Meters ( ≥ 1.5”)

The timing of Resolution No. R-50-24 is directly related to city staff working with the State
Department of Ecology to exhaust every possible alternative for a more equitable solution
before having to move forward with the contingency plan and ensure that the Biosolids
Lagoon is emptied before winter weather sets in and complicates hauling activities and
capacity considerations at both facilities in the near term.
Action, Resolution: 1.
RESOLUTION R-50-24 - A RESOLUTION CREATING A FEE FOR HAULING
OF BIOSOLIDS TO UTILITY CONSUMERS AND OTHER MATTERS RELATED
THERETO.
Motion by Ann Parks, second by Pat Wright.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Nathan Weller, Pat Wright, Megan Guido, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira,
Trymaine Gaither
O. Discussion Items
Discussion Items: 1. Goals & Priorities Workgroups
Mayor Benjamin and the Council discussed the Welcoming Workgroup and the Bypass
Workgroup and how they would move forward.
P. New Business
Mayor Benjamin asked if any new business would come before the Council. There was
none.
Q. Executive Session
There was not an Executive Session.
R. Adjournment
Action: 1. A Motion to Adjourn the Regular Meeting of Pullman City Council.
Motion by Pat Wright, second by Ann Parks.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Ann Parks, Nathan Weller, Pat Wright, Megan Guido, Eric Fejeran, Carla De Lira,
Trymaine Gaither
The meeting adjourned at 7:42 p.m.
