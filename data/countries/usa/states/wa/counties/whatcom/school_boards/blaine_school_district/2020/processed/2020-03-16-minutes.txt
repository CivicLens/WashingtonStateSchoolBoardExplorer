  2. Action Items
A. Resolution 1920-11 Emergency – Suspension of Policy
This resolution language was recommended by WSSDA in order to assist districts in streamlining their actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic state of emergency. Superintendent Dr. Christopher Granger explained how adoption of this resolution would allow for policy requirements to be suspended as needed, only during the current COVID-19 pandemic state of emergency, so that the district could implement protocols as advised by OSPI. He provided the example of potentially adjusted graduation requirements that would normally be in violation of district policy but could be implemented for high school seniors during the current emergency school closure. He assured the board that any action by the district would be communicated to the directors.
  The board voted unanimously to adopt Resolution 1920-11 Emergency – Suspension of Policy in
response to the current COVID-19 pandemic state of emergency.
