OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
February 16, 2023 – Options High School, 2015 Franklin St., Bellingham, WA.
Call to Order/Land Acknowledgment:
Ms. Diaz Hackler called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m. She acknowledged that this
meeting is being held on the ancestral homelands of the Coast Salish people.
Roll Call:
Present: Directors Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler (President), Jenn Mason,
Katie Rose, Superintendent Greg Baker and Sheri O’Day (recorder). Director Kelly
Bashaw was unable to attend the meeting.
Audience:
No public testimony was offered.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Dr. Baker shared that WSSDA recently recognized Ms. Mason for five years of
service on the school board and Ms. Bashaw for fifteen years of service.
• Districts around the state are waiting to learn from the legislature what the budget
allocations will look like for the 2023-24 school year. ESSER funds will be coming to
an end. Districts are hoping the regionalization formula will be recalibrated, but it’s
unlikely this is a priority for the legislature. Staff compensation is the largest part of
the district’s budget, and the state’s prototypical staffing model does not account for
all staff in most districts, which necessitates using local funds for staff compensation.
Special Education, which has been historically underfunded by the state, is a focus for
the legislature. Dr. Baker and the executive team continue to watch all those factors
and brainstorm scenarios. The next revenue forecast will guide legislators on how
much funding preK-12 public education will receive.
• Tonight’s consent agenda includes monitoring reports on EL-3, Treatment and
Communication with Public, Parents and Students, and EL-4, Staff Treatment,
Compensation and Evaluation. The board will give its feedback at next month’s
regular meeting.
• Registration for Promise K has begun and kindergarten registration will begin soon.
The legislature has been debating about the future of transitional kindergarten.
• The high school course catalog has been completed and students are beginning to
register for 2023-24 classes.
• Unified basketball teams from Bellingham, Sehome and Squalicum high schools
hosted their final games for the season last night.

INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Ms. Mason thought the visit to the Bellingham Family Partnership Program (BFPP)
was very informative. It appears to work well for the families who believe it is the
right fit for them. The GRADS student roundtable was amazing, one of the best she
has attended, and she has shared with many people about the successful program.
These teen parents are truly highly capable learners. She believes lives and families
are forever changed for the better because of the program. One of Ms. Mason’s
friends who volunteers at Birchwood has told her how amazing everyone is there and
talked specifically about the Family Resource Center and Family Engagement team.
• Mr. Benjamin agreed that the GRADS student roundtable was amazing. It was great
to see how the BFPP has grown and matured since the board’s last visit. He noted that
special education is the number one legislative priority for WSSDA this year and he
is hoping for progress. The policy governance research project that he has
participated in with a Grand Canyon University student has been completed. Most of
it involved discussion about inter-board relationships, and he hopes the research will
shine a light on policy governance.
• Ms. Rose was struck by the role community plays in the GRADS program and the
Bellingham Family Partnership Program (BFPP). The connection to resources and
others is so important to the programs’ success. She found the BFPP visit interesting
and eye-opening and wishes that those opportunities were available to all families.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler agrees that both the GRADS and BFPP visits were great. She
attended a visit to the Northwest Career & Technical Academy in Mount Vernon

earlier this month. The following week she toured the North Puget Sound Carpenter
