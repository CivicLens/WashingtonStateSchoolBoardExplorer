OPENING ITEMS
Meeting Date and Location:
September 12, 2018 - 1306 Dupont St., Bellingham, Washington
Call to Order/Roll Call:
Ms. Bashaw called the meeting to order at 6:03 p.m. Present: Directors Kelly Bashaw
(President), Camille Diaz Hackler, Douglas Benjamin, Jenn Mason, Quenby Peterson,
Superintendent Greg Baker, and Sheri O’Day (recorder).
Audience:
• Lisa Marx: She would like to encourage students to pursue careers in apprenticeship
programs. Lisa is an Outreach Specialist for the Northwest Carpenters’ Institute and
has been a resident of Whatcom County for 30 years. She noted that there will be
many upcoming job openings in the field of carpentry.
• Scott Ostlund: He is a product of the Bellingham Public Schools who has lived here
for his entire life and whose children now attend or have attended Bellingham Public
Schools. He is curious about responsible bidder language and concerned that our
community provides good, living-wage jobs for our community members. He is
interested in the local hire requirements for the companies who are bidding on
Bellingham Public Schools’ construction jobs.
• Miguel Perry: He is an organizer with the carpenters’ union who began his
apprenticeship in 1980, became a journeyman and continued with his education,
eventually earning his bachelors and masters degrees. He noted that pensions,
benefits, wages and training are important to employees. Responsible bidder language
protects against unscrupulous contractors. He asked that the district consider creating
opportunities for young people to graduate and work in the construction field.
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
• Dr. Baker welcomed everyone back to the new school year.
• Regarding the new Bellingham Education Association (BEA) contract, both
bargaining teams have worked for months under difficult circumstances with a
changing state funding landscape. The new two-year contract was agreed upon on
Aug. 24, which enabled us to start school on time. The 2018-19 budget was built
based on advice from many parties across the state, and things quickly changed over
the last month regarding clarity about funding. Most districts in the state anticipate
making fairly dramatic cuts beginning next year. Dr. Baker anticipates that the district
will need to reduce spending by $5 to 6 million in order to sustain a healthy fund
balance. It may be that the legislature will make changes this spring that will alter the

budgeting forecast. He anticipates that will include staffing reductions by attrition,
increasing class sizes (grades 4-12), and decreasing some investments such as
nursing, special education and counseling. In addition, inevitably when one employee
group receives an increase in compensation other employee groups will need to be
recalibrated. The district cares about all employee groups and wants to make sure
they are fairly compensated. In order to balance letting the community know and not
raising anxiety, Dr. Baker has begun visiting all school staff meetings and parent
group meetings to tell this story. He thanked the staff involved in bargaining for
giving up much of their summer in order to negotiate the contract and to be sure we
were able to start school on time. Ms. Peterson requested a brief description of how
the Bellingham Public Schools is affected by the funding changes prior to attending
the Legislative Assembly in Spokane this month.
We have had a smooth beginning to the school year and staff is busy getting students
acclimated to being back in school.
The 1:1 initiative has been expanded to all middle and high schools this year. All
schools now have tech coaches supporting teachers.
Options High School now has three classrooms for children of students in the
GRADS program, including a new preschool.

CONSENT ITEMS:
Ms. Diaz Hackler said her husband works for Construction Supply Co., Inc. and Ms.
Peterson indicated that an immediate family member is working with two firms (Dawson
Construction and Dykeman Architecture) that the district has retained for the Sehome
High School construction project. To avoid a conflict of interest per RCW 42.23.030, Ms.
Diaz Hackler and Ms. Peterson will recuse themselves from voting on Item 2.3 (Approval
of Expenditures and Payroll). Ms. Peterson made a motion to vote on item 2.3
