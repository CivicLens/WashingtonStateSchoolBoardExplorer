To:

Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

From: Shawn Lewis
Subject: Financial Update
Attached are the Budget Status Reports for all funds as of the end of July 2024, along with
charts and data showing our monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund cash
balance.
Our General Fund Balance as of July 31 is $3,596,905. This $3.6 million fund balance is above
2021-22 fund balance levels. Cash with the County Treasurer amounted to $3.4 million. The
difference is for prepaid expenses that have been made for the 2024-25 school year.
I am in the process of looking at all our program and grant expenditures to ensure our spending
levels are sufficient to retain all our revenue – and it appears that we will have carryover in
some programs. As you know, this is a condition that exists when the state has provided us
resources in a program but we have not yet spent enough in that program to exhaust the
funding. When this happens, our overall fund balance will be higher – but we will need to
spend more money in the next year to spend down those resources.
One large expense that we had anticipated for July was for Running Start at Pierce College, but
they did not send their invoice in time for July payment. This $500,000 expense will be
processed in August – so July expenses are lower than normal and August will be higher than
normal. In August, we will also be making a transfer from the Capital Projects Fund to the Debt
Service Fund for a debt payment to be made in December.
No other expenses or revenue are different from expectations in the General Fund.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Per WAC 181-82-110, teachers may teach outside of their endorsement area if certain conditions are
met. If individuals are assigned outside of their endorsement area, the following needs to happen:
•
•

•

The out-of-endorsement assignment needs to be approved by the local school board.
The district and the teacher “mutually develop a written plan” for assistance to the teacher. The
plan needs to provide “a reasonable amount of planning and study time associated specifically
with the out-of-endorsement assignment.” Plans might include mentoring, PLC time with teachers
in the content area, taking a course, independent study, and so on. Although it may, the plan does
not have to include acquiring the endorsement.
There are no out-of-endorsement provisions for CTE teachers.

For the 2024-2025 school year, the district has identified six teachers who will be assigned a
course that meets the definition of out of endorsement. During the school year, teachers will
access options such as, taking the appropriate endorsement test; attending professional
development; and attending professional learning communities. Out of the six teachers
identified, we anticipate four will continue to meet the definition of out of endorsement due to
current OSPI and PESB rules and course coding.

conditions that may reasonably affect the potential for resumption of performance.
(2) When DSHS determines that the funding insufficiency is resolved, it will give Contractor written

suspension. DSHS shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the terms of this
Contract for services rendered prior to the retroactive date of termination.

termination shall be effective on the date specified in the termination notice. DSHS shall be liable

conditions of this Contract. Only the CCLS Chief or designee has the authority to waive any term or
condition of this Contract on behalf of DSHS.
Additional General Terms and Conditions – Interlocal Agreements:

Disputes. Both DSHS and the Contractor (“Parties”) agree to work in good faith to resolve all conflicts
at the lowest level possible. However, if the Parties are not able to promptly and efficiently resolve,
through direct informal contact, any dispute concerning the interpretation, application, or
implementation of any section of this Agreement, either Party may reduce its description of the dispute
in writing, and deliver it to the other Party for consideration. Once received, the assigned managers or
designees of each Party will work to informally and amicably resolve the issue within five (5) business
days. If managers or designees are unable to come to a mutually acceptable decision within five (5)

Page 7
Packet page 97 of 518

DSHS General Terms and Conditions
business days, they may agree to issue an extension to allow for more time.
If the dispute cannot be resolved by the managers or designees, the issue will be referred through each
Agency’s respective operational protocols, to the Secretary of DSHS (“Secretary”) and the Contractor’s
Agency Head (“Agency Head”) or their deputies or designated delegates. Both Parties will be
responsible for submitting all relevant documentation, along with a short statement as to how they
believe the dispute should be settled, to the Secretary and Agency Head.
Upon receipt of the referral and relevant documentation, the Secretary and Agency Head will confer to
consider the potential options of resolution, and to arrive at a decision within fifteen (15) business days.
The Secretary and Agency Head may appoint a review team, a facilitator, or both, to assist in the
resolution of the dispute. If the Secretary and Agency Head are unable to come to a mutually
acceptable decision within fifteen (15) business days, they may agree to issue an extension to allow for
more time.
The final decision will be put in writing, and will be signed by both the Secretary and Agency Head. If
the Agreement is active at the time of resolution, the Parties will execute an amendment or change
order to incorporate the final decision into the Agreement. The decision will be final and binding as to
the matter reviewed and the dispute shall be settled in accordance with the terms of the decision.
If the Secretary and Agency Head are unable to come to a mutually acceptable decision, the Parties
will request intervention by the Governor, per RCW 43.17.330, in which case the governor shall employ
whatever dispute resolution methods that the governor deems appropriate in resolving the dispute.
Both Parties agree that, the existence of a dispute notwithstanding, the Parties will continue without
delay to carry out all respective responsibilities under this Agreement that are not affected by the
dispute.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The 2024-25 budget was presented to the board in June and has been available for public review
and comment. The ESD has reviewed the budget document and has approved it for submission to
OSPI pending board approval.
As indicated in the resolution, approval would allow the 2025 collection of our educational programs
and operations levy as well as the capital projects and technology levy – both approved by voters.
The resolution also authorizes an appropriation level for each of the funds managed by the district.
Finally, the resolution allows for a transfer of capital projects levy funding to the debt service fund
for the purpose of debt repayment.
The biggest risk factor for the district is related to enrollment projections. The district consulted with
a demographer for use with our budget estimates, but future enrollment trends are unknown and
may have negative or positive impacts to future revenue and spending plans.
Despite this risk, the 2024-25 budget is responsible and conservative. The superintendent
continues to provide close oversight of spending and we will continue to monitor enrollment and
spending closely.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
I move approval of Resolution 927-08-21-24.

Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent

2/ G.L.535 is an account that is used to summarize actions for other financing uses such as long-term financing and debt
extingishments. Nonvoted debts may be serviced in the Debt Service Fund (DSF) rather than in the fund that received the debt
proceeds. In order to provide the resources to retire the debt, a transfer is used by the General Fund, Capital Projects Fund, or
Transportation Vehicle Fund to transfer resources to the DSF. Refer to Page DS4 for detail of estimated outstanding nonvoted bond
detail information.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF DIRECTORS
Board Meeting Date: August 21, 2024
Strategic Focus Area
☐ Achieve
☐ Support

☐ Connect
☒ Plan
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The 2023-24 school year budget was originally adopted by the board in the Summer of 2023.
As previously discussed with the board in monthly budget status updates beginning in September
2023:
• Enrollment in Running Start was significantly higher than anticipated, creating an
unanticipated cost of nearly $700,000
• Overall enrollment in the district is lower than our original projection
• Actual revenue has changed from our original projections, with some decreases due to
enrollment changes and some increases due to increased grant activity and other factors
• A planned transfer from the general fund to the debt service fund is no longer necessary due
to the passage of the capital projects levy.
The budget revision being considered has been reviewed by the Educational Service District and
has posted on our website since July 3rd, 2024.
A public hearing was held earlier in this evening’s meeting to hear public comment on increasing
the General Fund.
The budget extension request reflects an increase to the General Fund expenditure budget from
$51,062,265 plus a $450,000 transfer to $51,746,265 of expenditure authority.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
I move approval of Resolution 928-08-21-24 increasing the General Fund budget for the 2023-24
school year.

Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent

Resolution 928-08-21-24
RESOLUTION OF BUDGET EXTENSION
WHEREAS, WAC 392-123-071 through 392-123-074 and WAC 392-123-078 and 392123-079 allows a first class district to file an increase of the amount of appropriation from
any fund, and
WHEREAS, the General Fund of Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 has
expenditures in the 2023-24 school year that were not recognized in the originally
adopted budget which will require an increase in appropriation of nearly $684,000, and
WHEREAS, an anticipated transfer of general fund resources to the debt service fund
originally anticipated for 2023-24 is no longer deemed necessary, and
WHEREAS, the enrollment of Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 in the 2023-24
school year is less than originally anticipated, and
WHEREAS, the General Fund beginning fund balance plus anticipated revenues is
sufficient to provide for the additional expenditures.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED the Board of Directors of Steilacoom Historical School
District No. 1, Pierce County, Washington, hereby petition OSPI to increase the 2023-24
General Fund appropriation amount from $51,512,265 including budgeted transfers to
$51,746,265.
Approved by the Board of Directors of Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1, Pierce

2/ G.L.535 is an account that is used to summarize actions for other financing uses such as long-term financing and debt
extingishments. Nonvoted debts may be serviced in the Debt Service Fund (DSF) rather than in the fund that received the debt
proceeds. In order to provide the resources to retire the debt, a transfer is used by the General Fund, Capital Projects Fund, or
Transportation Vehicle Fund to transfer resources to the DSF. Refer to Page DS4 for detail of estimated outstanding nonvoted bond
detail information.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
September was first declared as National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month in 2008. Since then,
September has been a time to acknowledge those affected by suicide, raise awareness, and connect
individuals with suicidal ideation to treatment services. According to the CDC, in 2021 more than 48,000
individuals died by suicide, leaving behind friends and family members to navigate the tragedy of their
loss. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among adults in the U.S. and the 2nd leading cause of
death among people aged 10-24 and these rates are increasing. That is why this year, during the month
of September, Steilacoom Historical School District and others across the country will work to raise
awareness of this often taboo topic, decrease the stigma associated with suicide and connect our
community with resources and support through Suicide Prevention Awareness Month.
While suicide prevention is important to address year round, Suicide Prevention Awareness Month
provides a dedicated time to come together with collective passion and strength to address this difficult
topic. We believe that everyone in our community can benefit from honest conversations about mental
health conditions and suicide.
The accompanying resolution recognizes that, together with our local community stakeholders, parents,
students, teachers, and staff we can raise awareness, decrease stigma, build resiliency, and find hope.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
It is the Superintendent’s recommendation that the School Board adopt Resolution 929-08-21-24.

National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month
WHEREAS, the Steilacoom Historical School District recognizes that suicide is a leading cause of
death among youth and supports actions in preventing suicidal ideation, attempts, and deaths: and
WHEREAS, according to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2021, one person died by suicide every
11 minutes, resulting in more than 48,000 deaths each year in the United States; and

leading cause of death among people aged 10-24; and
WHEREAS, suicide is a preventable national, State and local public health problem; and
WHEREAS, providing a safe and nurturing school environment ensures both the physical and
emotional safety of students and staff and minimizes suicidal ideation: and
WHEREAS, the stigma associated with mental health conditions and suicidality works against
suicide prevention by discouraging persons at risk for suicide from seeking life-saving help and
further traumatizes survivors of suicide loss as well as people with lived experience of suicide; and
WHEREAS, it is essential to educate and encourage students, staff and families to recognize the
warning signs of suicide, and guide those in need to appropriate services and supports; and
WHEREAS, the Month of September is National Suicide Prevention Month, which is a campaign in

educate students, parents, and others about their role in suicide prevention; and
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Governing Board of the Steilacoom Historical
School District hereby supports the goals of National Suicide Prevention Month and will work with a

Drills:
Drills are an essential component of safety planning. Drills teach students and staff basic functional responses to potential threats and hazards. The four functional responses are adaptable and
can be applied to a variety of situations. Additionally, some threats or hazards may require the
use of more than one basic functional response. Therefore, each school in the district will conduct at least one safety-related drill per month, including summer months when school is in session with students. Drill planning and implementation shall consider and accommodate the needs
of all students.

Basic Functional Drills
The basic functional responses include shelter-in-place, lockdowns, evacuations, and earthquakes
(drop-cover-hold –on):
Lockdowns
Lockdowns are meant to isolate students and staff from threats of violence, such as suspicious
trespassers, armed intruders, and other threats that may occur in a school or in the vicinity of a
school. Staff and students will receive instruction so that in the event of the breach of security of
a school building or campus,; staff, students, and visitors will be able to take positions in secure
enclosures. Lockdown drills will not include live simulations of or reenactments of active
shooter scenarios that are not trauma-informed and age and developmentally appropriate.
Evacuations
When an emergency within a school or its surrounding area necessitates evacuation and/or total
or partial closure of the schools within the district, staff will be responsible for aiding in the safe
evacuation of the students within the endangered school or its surrounding area.
Staff and students will receive instruction so that in the event the school or district needs to be
evacuated, due to threats, such as fires, oil train spills, earthquakes, etc. Theyor tsunamis, they
will be able to leave the building in the shortest time possible and take the safest route possible to
a designated reunification site. another school or facility.
Shelter-in-Place
Shelter in place is designed to limit the exposure of students and staff to hazardous materials,
such as chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants that are released into the environment
by isolating the inside environment from the outside. Staff and Students will receive instruction
so that in the case of a hazardous vapor release that doesn’t allow time to evacuate the campus,
they will be able to remain inside, and take the steps necessary to eliminate or minimize the
health and safety hazard.
Earthquakes: Drop-Cover-Hold on
The board recognizes the importance of protecting staff, students, and facilities in the event of an
earthquake. Facilities will be designed and maintained in a manner that recognizes the potential
danger from such an occurrence. Likewise, staff must be prepared to take necessary action to
protect students and staff from harm.

Page 2 of 4
Packet page 444 of 518

Policy No. 3432
Students
“Drop – cover – hold on” is the basic functional earthquake response. The superintendent or designee will establish guidelines and action taken by building principals should an earthquake occur while school is in session.
Additional Drills
In addition to the above four functional response drills, the districtDistrict shall, at a minimum,
also develop response plans for the following:
Bomb Threats
The superintendent or designee will establish procedures for action in the event that any threat is
received toward the school by telephone, letter, orally, or by other means.
Emergency School Closure or Evacuation (Modified Shelter-in-Place)
When weather conditions or other circumstances make it unsafe to operate schools the superintendent or designee is directed to determine whether schools should be started late, closed for the
day, or transportation will be provided only on emergency routes. Those decisions will be communicated through community media resources pursuant to a plan developed by the superintendent or designee.
When an emergency within a school or its surrounding area necessitates evacuation and/or total
or partial closure of the schools within the district, staff will be responsible for aiding in the safe
evacuation of the students within the endangered school or its surrounding area.
The superintendent or designee will establish procedures for the emergency closure of a building or department.
Pandemic/Epidemic
The board recognizes that a pandemic outbreak is a serious threat that could affect students, staff
and the community. The superintendent or designee will serve as a liaison between the school
district and local health officials. The district liaison, in consultation with local health officials,
will ensure that a pandemic/epidemic plan exists in the district and establish procedures to provide for staff and student safety during such an emergency.
All safety plans and drills shall include protocols for both internal and external communications,
as well as procedures for drill documentation. Evacuation plans shall also include reunification
plans. Schools shall document the dates and time of such drills. Each school will maintain the
time and type of drill follow district procedures.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
On August 1, 2024, the 2024 Title IX Rules issued by the U.S. Department of Education went into
effect. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is the federal law that prohibits discrimination
on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance.
These rules outline K-12 public schools’ obligations to provide an educational environment free
from sex-based discrimination and specify how schools must respond to notice and complaints of
sex-based discrimination. WSSDA has provided revised model policies to ensure school districts
are in compliance.
Policy 3205 Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of Students Prohibited
Policy 5011 Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of Staff Prohibited
The revisions include - emphasizing the district’s commitment to provide a safe and
nondiscriminatory learning and working environment for students and staff; expanding the definition
of “sexual harassment”; and clarifying the annual district notice requirements.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
I move adoption of policies 3205 and 5011.

Students

SEX DISCRIMINATION AND SEX-BASED UAL HARASSMENT
OF STUDENTS PROHIBITED
This district is committed to a positive and productive education free from discrimination. The
district does not discriminate on the basis of sex and prohibits sex discrimination in any
education program or activity that it operates, as required by Federal and State laws, including
sexual harassment. This commitment extends to all students involved in academic, educational,
extracurricular, athletic, and other programs or activities of the school, whether that program or
activity is in a school facility, on school transportation, or at a class or school training held
elsewhere.
The district has jurisdiction over complaints of sex discrimination, including sex-based
harassment, pursuant to the Federal law Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title
IX) and Washington State laws, including Chapter 28A.640 RCW and Chapter 392-190 WAC.
This policy is developed to meet the district’s obligations under Title IX and aligned with
Washington State laws and regulations that define sex discrimination. Sex discrimination that
does not fall under this policy may be addressed under other district policies and procedures.
The district prohibits sex discrimination of students by other students, employees, or third parties
involved in school district activities. The district also prohibits sex discrimination in the policies,
procedures, and practices of the district’s program and activities, including but not limited to
counseling and guidance services, recreational and athletics activities, and access to course
offerings.
For purposes of this policy, “sex discrimination” includes discrimination on the basis of sex, sex
stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, gender
identity, and gender expression. Sex-based harassment is a form of sex discrimination and is
prohibited by this policy.
Definitions
“Sex-based harassment” means sexual harassment and other harassment on the basis of sex
stereotypes, sex characteristics, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy
or related conditions, and marital status.
For purposes of this policy, sexual harassment means unwelcome conduct or communication of a
sexual nature. Sexual harassment can occur adult to student, student to student or can be carried
out by a group of students or adults and will be investigated by the District even if the alleged
harasser is not a part of the school staff or student body. The district prohibits sexual harassment
of students by other students, employees, or third parties involved in school district activities.
The term “sexual harassment” includes the following, which Title IX defines at 34 C.F.R. §
106.2:may include:


“Quid pro quo harassment,”

Policy No. 3205
Students



“Hostile environment harassment,” and
Specific offensesacts of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking;



The term “sexual harassment” is also prohibited under state law as defined at WAC 392190-056 and includes unwelcome sexual or gender-directed conduct or communication
that interferes with an individual’s educational performance or creates an intimidating,
hostile, or offensive environment;
 unwelcome sexual advances,;

unwelcome requests for sexual favors, sexually motivated physical contact, or other
verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature between two or more individuals
if:;
a. Submission to that conduct or communication sexual demands when submission is a
stated or implied condition of obtaining an education oreducational benefit;
b. sexual demands where submission or rejection is a factor in decisionsan academic, or
other school-related decision affecting that individual's education; oran individual.
c. the conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with
an individual's educational performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive educational environment.
Harassment based on sexual orientation, gender expression, or gender identity is also prohibited
under Washington state law.
For the purpose of these definitions, sex-based harassment may include conduct or
communication that involves adult to student, student to adult, student to student, adult to adult,
male to female, female to male, male to male, and female to female.
The district will address all sex-based harassment in its program and activities, even when some
conduct alleged to be contributing to a hostile environment occurs outside of its program or
activities.
The district has also developed other specific, related policies for students to comply with its
obligations under State and Federal laws, to comply with its obligations under State and Federal
laws, including Title IX, and to create inclusive and welcoming school-communities.
A “hostile environment” has been created for a student when sexual harassment is sufficiently
serious to interfere with or limit the student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s
program. The more severe the conduct, the less need there is to demonstrate a repetitive series of
incidents. In fact, a single or isolated incident of sexual harassment may create a hostile
environment if the incident is sufficiently severe, violent, or egregious.
Investigation and Response

The Superintendent will develop and implement procedures for receiving, investigating, and
resolving complaints or reports of sex discrimination and will include reasonable and prompt
timelines and delineate roles and responsibilities for such.

Students
If the district knows, or reasonably should know, that sex discriminationsexual harassment has
occurredcreated a hostile environment, it will promptly investigate to determine what occurred
and take appropriate steps to resolve the situation. If an investigation reveals that sexbasedsexual harassment has created a hostile environment, the district will take prompt and
effective steps reasonably calculated to end the sex-basedsexual harassment, eliminate the hostile
environment, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its effects. The district will take
prompt, equitable, and remedial action within its authority on reports, complaints, and grievances

discriminationsexual harassment comes to the attention of the district, either formally or
informally.
Allegations of criminal misconduct will be reported to law enforcement and suspected child
abuse will be reported to law enforcement or Child Protective Services as required by law.
Regardless of whether the misconduct is reported to law enforcement, school staff will promptly
investigate to determine what occurred and take appropriate steps to resolve the situation, to the
extent that such investigation does not interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation. A
criminal investigation does not relieve the district of its independent obligation to investigate and
resolve sex-basedsexual harassment.
Engaging in sex-basedsexual harassment will result in appropriate discipline or other appropriate
sanctions against offending students, staff, or other third parties involved in school district
activities. Anyone else who engages in sex-basedsexual harassment on school property or at
school activities will have their access to school property and activities restricted, as appropriate.

harassment. Persons found to knowingly report or corroborate false allegations will be subject to
appropriate discipline as discussed in the Superintendent’s procedure. However, no party,
witness, or others participating in the district’s grievance process will be disciplined based solely
on a determination of whether sex discrimination occurred under the Superintendent’s procedure.

sex-based discrimination. WSSDA has provided revised model policies to ensure school districts
are in compliance.
Policy 3205 Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of Students Prohibited
Policy 5011 Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment of Staff Prohibited
The revisions include - emphasizing the district’s commitment to provide a safe and
nondiscriminatory learning and working environment for students and staff; expanding the definition
of “sexual harassment”; and clarifying the annual district notice requirements.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
I move adoption of policies 3205 and 5011.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Policy 6220 outlines the requirements for purchasing using district funds, and specifically
identifies when the district needs to conduct certain procurement processes in order to be
in compliance with state and federal law.
The policy revisions presented to the board are intended to:
• incorporate changes to bid laws pertaining to small works rosters based on the
changes in SSB 5268 Public Works Procurement. The policy updates the statutory
references for small works rosters. There is an associated procedure update that
will provide more specifics to staff related to small works roster projects.
• reflect the language in the statutes authorizing interlocal agreements for
procurement, as well as best practices as identified by the State Auditor’s Office.
There is much more detail information about who the district may use interlocal
agreements to purchase through a different entities’ competitive solicitation.
These policy changes will result in some changes to internal processes to ensure
compliance.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
I move to approve the changes to Policy 6220.

board of other obligations under public works contract requirements, such as retainage,
prevailing wage, etc.projects contains the same specifications and the scope of the work
is essentially the same for the district as for the contract’s signatory district.
5. Ensure the cost is reasonable based on a cost/price analysis.
Once the district has completed these steps, it may enter into an agreement with the other entity
to utilize their contract. The contract must be signed by both parties prior to any procurement
taking place on the part of the district.
G. Crimes Against Children
The board will include in any contract for services with an entity or individual other than an
employee of the district a provision requiring the contractor to prohibit any employee of the
contractor from working at a public school who has contact with children at a public school
during the course of his or her employment and who has pled guilty to or been convicted of any
felony crime specified under RCW 28A.400.322. The contract shall also contain a provision that
any failure to comply with this section shall be grounds for the district immediately terminating
the contract.
H. Women and Minority Owned Businesses
The district will ensure that it is providing every opportunity for businesses owned by women or
minorities to submit bids on any contract. The district will maintain documentation of efforts to
collect bids from women or minority-owned businesses as a part of the bidding process. The
district will also ensure that any small works roster or similar list is open and available to
participation by women or minority-owned businesses, and that such businesses on its small
works roster are treated fairly and equally when requesting bids.
II. Procurement Using Federal Funds

Packet page 467 of 518

Policy No. 6220
Management Support
A. Goods
When the district uses federal funds for procurement of textbooks, the allowable selfcertification is $50,000. When the district uses federal funds for procurement of goods,
including furniture, supplies, and equipment:





Purchases of $10,000 or less do not require quotes. However, the district must consider
the price to be reasonable based on research, experience, purchase history, or other
information and must document this determination. In addition, to the extent practical,
purchases must be distributed equitably among suppliers.
Purchases between $10,000 and $75,000 must be procured using price or rate quotations
from three or more qualified sources.
Purchases of $75,000 or more must be publicly solicited using its formal bidding
procedure.

Self-Certification
If during a given fiscal year, the district qualifies as a low-risk auditee in accordance with criteria
in 2 C.F.R. § 200.520, as determined by the auditor, or has documentation it received a low risk
assessment after an annual internal institutional risk assessment to identify, mitigate, and manage
financial risks, then the district may use the following Self Certification thresholds instead of the
ones described above:





Purchases of $40,000 or less do not require quotes. However, the district must consider
the price to be reasonable based on research, experience, purchase history or other
information and must document this determination. In addition, to the extent practical,
purchases must be distributed equitably among suppliers.
Purchases between $40,000 and $75,000 must be procured using price or rate quotations
from three or more qualified sources.
Purchases of $75,000 or more must be publicly solicited using the district’s formal
bidding procedure.

If the district uses Self-Certification, the Superintendent will develop Self-Certification
procedures to accompany this policy. Additionally, if the district qualifies for Self-Certification
and wants to go above the $40,000 or $50,000 Self-Certification limits, the district reserves the
right to seek approval for higher limits from OSPI.

B. Services
When the district uses federal funds for procurement of services:




Purchases of $10,000 or less do not require quotes. However, the district must consider

If the district uses Self-Certification, the Superintendent will develop Self-Certification
procedures to accompany this policy. Additionally, if the district qualifies for Self-Certification
and wants to go above the $40,000 or $50,000 Self-Certification limits, the district reserves the
right to seek approval for higher limits from OSPI.
C. Noncompetitive Procurement
Noncompetitive procurement may be used only when one of the following five circumstances
applies:







Acquiring property or services that do not exceed $10,000 [or in the case of a school
district who qualifies as a low-risk auditee in accordance with criteria in 2 C.F.R. §
200.520 or has documentation of an annual internal institutional risk assessment to
identify, mitigate, and manage financial risks, $40,000];
The item is only available from a single source;
The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting
from competitive solicitation;
The awarding agency (e.g., OSPI) authorizes noncompetitive procurement in response to
a written request from the district; or
After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.

The district must maintain documentation supporting the applicable circumstance for
noncompetitive procurement.
D. Cost/Price Analysis
The district will perform a cost or price analysis in connections with every procurement action in
excess of the federal simplified acquisition threshold, currently set at $250,000 or other limits
identified in 48 CFR 2.101, including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis
Page 5 of 8

Packet page 469 of 518

Policy No. 6220
Management Support
is dependent on facts surrounding the procurement situation, but should include, as a starting
point, independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals.
In cases where no price competition exists and in all cases where the district performs the cost
analysis, profit must be negotiated as a separate element in the process. To ensure profit is fair
and reasonable, consideration must be given to the complexity of the work performed, the risk
borne by the contractor, the contractor’s investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of
the contractor’s past performances, and industry standard profit rates in the surrounding
geographical area.
Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts are allowed only to the extent that the costs
incurred or cost estimates would be allowable under 2 CFR 200.400 - .476.

E. Suspension and Debarment
Before entering into federally funded vendor contracts for goods and services that equal or
exceed $25,000 and any subcontract award, the district will ensure the vendor is not suspended
or debarred from participating in federal assistance programs.

F. Conflict of Interest
No employee, officer, or agent may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a
contract supported by federal funds if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a
conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate
family, his or her partner, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the
parties indicated herein has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a
firm considered for a contract.
No employee, officer, or agent of the district may solicit or accept gratuities, favors, or anything
of monetary value from contractors or parties to subcontracts. Violation of these standards may
result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, suspension, dismissal, or removal.
G. Interlocal Cooperation Act
The board reserves the right to enter into interlocal cooperative agreements for purchases with
other governmental agencies, or groups of governmental agencies, pursuant to 2 CFR 200.318(e)
and the Interlocal Cooperation Act, Chapter 39.34 RCW. Prior to making any purchases through
agreements entered into in this manner, the district will confirm the other governmental agency
has followed its purchasing procedures, and shall maintain that documentation for the duration of
the contract. The board must have entered into these agreements prior to making any purchase
arrangements utilizing the contracted terms. Use of cooperative agreements for public works
contracts does not relieve the board of other obligations under public works contract
requirements, such as retainage, prevailing wage, etc.
In coordination with the Interlocal Cooperation Act, Chapter 39.34 RCW, the district may enter
into cooperative purchasing agreements with other governmental entities or groups of
governmental entities. These agreements may allow the district to purchase items using an
existing agreement without going through the standard procurement bid requirements.
Page 6 of 8

Packet page 470 of 518

Policy No. 6220
Management Support
Prior to enactment of any agreement under this authority, the district will review the work of the
governmental entity to ensure the following requirements are met:
1. The governmental entity conducted its own procurement process relating to the contract
under consideration.
a. The awarding entity must maintain adequate documentation on the
procurement process for the contract under consideration.
b. The awarding entity must have posted the bid notice on a website maintained
by a public agency, purchasing cooperative, or other service provider, or posted
a link on the state’s web portal.
c. The contracting agency must ensure that it met any procurement requirements
laid out in 2 CFR §200.317 – 200.327.
2. The contract contains language that it is open for use by other entities and is not expired.
3. The specifications laid out in the contract match the specifications identified by the
district. Any options that are agreed to in the contract are available to the district; any
options that are not agreed to in the contract are not allowed.
4. Any cooperative agreement for public works projects contains the same specifications
and that the scope of the work is essentially the same for the district as for the contract’s
signatory district.
5. Ensure the cost is reasonable based on a cost/price analysis.
6. The district must verify that the awarding entity is neither suspended nor debarred from
participating in federal assistance programs.
7. The district must also verify that the contract contains all contract provisions described in
2 CFR §200.327 and Appendix II to Part 200.
Once the district has completed these steps, it may enter into an agreement with the other entity
to utilize their contract. The contract must be signed by both parties prior to any procurement
taking place on the part of the district.
H. Women and Minority-Owned Businesses
The district will ensure that it is providing every opportunity for businesses owned by women or
minorities to submit bids on any contract. The district will maintain documentation of efforts to
collect bids from women or minority-owned businesses as a part of the bidding process. The
district will also ensure that any small works roster or similar list is open and available to
participation by women or minority-owned businesses, and that such businesses on its small
works roster are treated fairly and equally when requesting bids. The district will also include
language requiring any prime contractor that employs subcontractors to show proof that it
provides equal opportunity for bidding to women or minority-owned businesses.
I. Federal Agency or Pass-Through Entity Review
The district will maintain records of all purchases made using Federal funds and shall provide
any and all documentation to the Federal awarding agency or the state pass-through entity for
compliance with all rules and regulations.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The district’s minimum fund balance policy 6022 recognizes the importance of maintaining a
prudent fund balance in the general fund to ensure operational cash flow needs are met and to set
aside resources for known obligations and to help protect against unforeseen circumstances.
The policy requires the superintendent annually to present a general fund budget that includes a
commitment of at least 6% of the prior year’s expenditures towards a minimum fund balance.
The school board formally suspended this policy for the 2023-24 school in recognition of the
district’s financial situation at the time.
Under the direction of the superintendent, district staff have continued to make progress to restore
fund balances – but the 2024-25 school year budget still reflects a budget plan that results in the
district’s general fund balance being lower than the 6% target level at year end.
The 2024-25 budget as outlined in Resolution 927-08-21-24 reflects the district’s ongoing programs
and services plan and anticipates an ending fund balance is projected to be nearly 4% of prior year
expenditures. Because this level is below 6%, a temporary suspension of policy 6022 is
recommended.
Policy 1320 allows the board to suspend a policy by a majority vote of the members present,
provided all board members have received a notice of the meeting and the notice includes a
proposal to suspend the policy and an explanation of the purpose.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
I move the board suspend policy 6022 regarding minimum fund balance requirements for the 202425 school year.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

The SHSD 2024-25 School Year Student Fee Schedule is attached for board consideration
and approval. All ASB fee changes recommended have gone through the appropriate ASB
process for approval.
School meal prices are proposed to increase by 25 cents per meal again this year. This is
due to a combination of food price increases, labor cost increases, and added costs due to
Cherrydale students receiving breakfast for free in the upcoming school year. While we
had not anticipated another increase, we had also not anticipated the inflationary pressures
or state law changes that have been implemented.
Our breakfast and lunch prices are generally consistent with other school districts in the
area – but many school districts are now subsidizing additional breakfast and lunch costs
for students making meal price comparisons less meaningful from a district perspective.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
I move approval of the 2024-25 fee schedules as amended.

2024-25 Board Governance Goal Development (per Policy 1810 – Annual Governance Goals and Objectives)
Strategic Focus Area
☒ Achieve

☒ Support
☒ Connect
☒ Plan

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Annually, the board conducts a self-assessment to evaluate its own performance in terms of generally accepted
principles of successful board operations and the Washington School Board Standards. The Board reviews the results of
their self-assessment and uses the results as a part of their governance goal setting process (consistent with Board
Policies 1810 and 1820).
All five Board members completed their assessment on June 21, 2024. Results were tabulated by WSSDA. The selfassessment data is presented today for Board discussion and for the development of this year’s governance goals.
As a reminder, the Board’s 2023-24 Governance Goals* were:
GOAL 1: By the end of the academic year, each school board member will attend a minimum of three relevant
professional development sessions focused on governance best practices, with the aim of enhancing their knowledge and
skills in effective decision-making. Progress will be measured through documented attendance records, reflections on key
takeaways, and the application of acquired knowledge in at least one board meeting or policy discussion.
GOAL 2: Board members will actively contribute to their professional growth and help foster a culture of continuous
learning by committing to read a minimum of one relevant article or book chapter per month, sharing key takeaways and
insights. The chosen readings will directly align with Board responsibilities, providing insights on emerging trends and
successful strategies in the field of governance. Board members will engage in regular discussions and reflections on the
readings during monthly board meetings.
GOAL 3: Board members will actively contribute to their roles, staying connected with district priorities and fostering a
strong partnership between the board, district administration, staff, families, and the community by attending a
minimum of six district/school-sponsored events throughout the academic year. Board members will also offer
community engagement opportunities, like “coffee chats”, to stakeholders.
*The Board goals were not adopted until December 20, 2023, so the Board may choose to continue with these three
goals for 20024-25, in lieu of choosing new focus areas.
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Discussion to formulate the 2024-25 Board Governance Goals, to be adopted at the Board’s next regular Board meeting,
on September 18, 2024.

Framework for Governance
Since 2011, school boards across our state have participated in the WSSDA Board SelfAssessment, which is based on the five Washington School Board Standards. The report
generated by the survey questions is thorough and thought-provoking. Participating boards
report that analyzing this data as a team leads to rich and productive discussions.
The data on the following page is organized in a color-coded, horizontal-stacked bar chart that
shows your results at the level of the five standards. The explanation for the color code is just
above the data chart. Subsequent pages show the data from each question, with the page
header showing the standard and benchmark the question relates to.

Analyzing your Results: Looking at Data
Start with the following page, which shows your district's aggregated data for each of the five
standards. Identify standards that capture strengths, growth areas and or divergent
perspectives, then work through the benchmarks and indicators for those standards.
Here is a simple protocol for your use.
Step 1: What do you see?
Describe what you see in the data, identify where it is located to the group. This is
not about interpretation at this stage, only what you see.
List the descriptions on chart paper.
Step 2: What does the data suggest?
Discuss what the data suggests and try to generate different interpretations. Ask
clarifying questions of one another to increase clarity and understanding of one
another’s perspectives.
List responses on the chart paper.
Step 3: Identify goal areas from the lists generated.
Step 4: Build two to three goals using the SMART goal framework.
