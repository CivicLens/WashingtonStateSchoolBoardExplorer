Subject :

A. Budget and Enrollment Reports

Meeting :

Jan 22, 2024 - Board of Directors Study Session and

Regular Meeting
Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the Budget and Enrollment
reports as presented.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
December Budget Reports:
Fund balance and net cash: The beginning fund balance for the 2023-24 year was $3.8 million. As of the end of December 2023, the fund
balance was $1 million (compared to $6.7 million last December 2022) and net cash is approximately $3.3 million (compared to $6.7 million
last December 2022). These balances have decreased from the previous month and while it is consistent with the normal pattern at this time
of year, it is at a significantly lower balance across this fiscal year than in prior years. Consistent with prior year trends, fund balance, net
cash, and revenues show a large spike in October from receipt of a large portion of local property taxes. December shows declines
especially since the state apportionment allocation in November is only 5% of the total allocation versus 9% in other months. Fund balance
and net cash will continue to decrease in the coming months as the influx of levy dollars tapers down, until the next big influx in April.
Meanwhile expenditures remain at a fairly consistent monthly level. A short-term temporary interfund loan from the Capital Projects is
planned for the next few coming months and especially for the month of June which is typically the lowest point in the year for fund balance.
Local Tax Revenue: The district has received 44% of total budgeted General Fund tax revenues for the 2023-24 fiscal year. Tax revenues
received year-to-date amount to $4.2 million of the $9.6 million budgeted.
State Apportionment Revenues: The district is expecting to experience an increase in the State Apportionment allocation since actual
average full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment is approximately 122 more than budgeted enrollment. The District requested OSPI to adjust
the enrollment figure used to disburse the District's monthly allocation, to a level that would more closely align with the increase in enrollment
that the district is experiencing. This will allow the district to receive needed revenues earlier and support cash flow levels for November and
December. The amount of the increase will be more evident with January's apportionment which is when the State makes its annual 'true-up'
on its payments to school districts. January is when the state adjusts from paying school districts based on budgeted average student FTE to
payments based on ACTUAL average student FTE. The increase in apportionment will be spread out from January to August and is
estimated to be between $1-1.5 million dollars.
January Enrollment Report:
The final January 2024 enrollment reports are submitted for Board review and approval. Actual enrollment for January 2024 was 5,433.51
FTE (Full-Time-Equivalent). January's enrollment decreased 12.10 FTE compared to December's enrollment. The average FTE taking into
consideration September through January monthly enrollments is 5,435.59. This is 121.59 FTE more than budgeted enrollment of 5,314.00.
Compared to 2022-23 average enrollment, the district is serving approximately 73 more student FTE in 2023-24 than the year before.
Previous Board Action:
Board acceptance of Budget Reports for November 2023 occurred at the January 8, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.
December enrollment was approved by the Board during the January 8, 2024, Regular Board Meeting.

Champions Grant.

Public Content
Submitted by:
Dave McKellar, Director of Special Education; and
Brenda Booth, Director of Learning Support
Background Information:
This is our second year to participate with ESD 189 as a result of the Preschool Inclusion Champions Grant.Arlington Public Schools (APS),
through the Special Education Department, originally applied for the Preschool Inclusion Champions (PIC) grant in November, 2022. The
Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), awarded the grant to districts who were wanting to begin the work of inclusionary
practices with preschool-age children. Arlington Public Schools has begun the work of imagining and creating opportunities for our
developmental preschool students to learn in environments with typically developing peers.

Administrative Considerations:
A PIC team has been periodically meeting this past year. The team consists of preschool teachers, one
school psychologist and one speech language pathologist being led by Brenda Booth.
Budgetary Impact:
There is no budgetary impact as this is a grant. The team will be operating within the parameters of the grant.OSPI confirmed through the
Northwest ESD, that the grant was approved for our district in the amount of $5,000.

Billing)

Meeting :

Jan 22, 2024 - Board of Directors Study Session and

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the Revalidation for the
Provider One contract as presented.

Goals :

Goal 1: Student Learning & Achievement

Public Content
Submitted by:
Brenda Booth, Director Learning Support
Background Information:
Every five years Arlington Public Schools (APS) contracts with Provider One (Health Care Authority) who manages our Medicaid program.
This allows APS to bill Medicaid and receive reimbursement for related services (speech, occupational therapy, and physical therapy) for
students who qualify to receive these services.
Administrative Considerations:
This program allows the district to annually collect over $100,000 in reimbursements for services rendered to students in our system.
Budgetary Impact:
If this contract were not in place, the impact to the Special Education budget would be considerable and would severely impact our ability to
provide services to students.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:

Approval at the January 22, 2024 meeting would help expedite the renewal of the contract and
reimbursements in process.

D. Resolution 24-02 Interfund Loan

Type :

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves Resolution 24-02
Interfund Loan.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
The district has been carefully tracking cash flow, and projections indicate a cash shortfall is anticipated, potentially as early as the end of
January. The District is requesting an interfund loan allowance to meet current obligations in January, February and March, until the April
and May taxes are received by the District. WAC 392-123-140 allows for a temporary interfund loan from Capital Projects Fund to the
General Fund, provided the loan does not interfere with the operation of the Capital Projects Fund and that the General Fund pays the
amount of interest to the Capital Projects Fund that it would have earned had it remained invested with the County. The recommended loan
authorization amount is $600,000, to be used to operate during January through April as needed. The District plans to transfer only that
which is needed to meet the current cash flow for January, February, or March, one month at a time to minimize interest costs, and with
cumulative amounts not to exceed $600,000. The anticipated loan payback would by the end of April 2024. Monthly financial reports will
specify actual outstanding interfund loans and actual interest charges involved.

Administrative Considerations:

Per WAC laws 392-123-135 through 160, and the State Accounting Manual for School Districts, interfund
loans from the Capital Projects Fund are authorized when approved by resolution by the school board of
directors. An interfund loan is considered to be a temporary loan of moneys between one district fund and
another. As a temporary loan, it is to be completely liquidated in less than one year from the date of
issuance. Loans shall not be made from any fund where there would be a detriment of any function or
project for that fund. Moneys loaned should only include money that is not currently needed by the
loaning fund. Interest must be paid by the borrowing fund to the loaning fund at a rate not less than the
warrant interest rate used by the Snohomish County Treasurer's Office in calculating investment interest
for the District. The resolution adopted by the board should state the amount of the loan, the funds
involved, the source of repayment, and the interest rate involved.
Budgetary Impact:

Interest must be paid by the borrowing fund to the loaning fund. The interest rate to be used is the rate
the Snohomish County Treasurer uses for the District's investments during the periods/months of the loan.
The estimated loan interest to be paid to the Capital Projects Fund could be approximately $8,000 (For example, using December's interest
rate of 5.5355% APR, generates approximately $88.03 per day. If the entire $600,000 were utilized for 90 days, the cost would be
$7,922.70). This amount may change depending on the County's actual interest rate during the period as applied to the part of the $600,000
that may be outstanding, and the actual payback date(s).
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:

The interfund loan must be authorized by Board Resolution prior to making the loan. The District is
bringing this interfund loan request to the board in an abundance of caution for the month of January, but
further anticipates a loan will be needed to meet current obligations in February and March, until the bulk
of the District's tax collections are received in April and May. This should relieve the need for the loan and
allow for repayment. June is another low point for cash flow and the District plans to request an additional
temporary short-term interfund loan at that time.

Action, Reports

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the Teachers Out of
Field report.

Public Content
Submitted by:
Eric DeJong, Executive Director of Human Resources
Background Information:
Each year, for a variety of reasons,we have teachers who teachsubjects that are out of their endorsement
area. During the current school year, there are 21 teachers teaching one or more subjects out of their
endorsement area.Many of these teachers previously met the "highly qualified" standard for the subjects
they are teaching, but due to the change in law, these teachers now show up as Teaching Out of Field
(TOF). Some teachers appear on the list because they are supporting an online course that is outside
their endorsed area, or they are teaching in a related field to an endorsement (i.e. teaching earth/space
science but only has a physics endorsement). Others are on the list due to an error that will eventually be
cleaned up with OSPI (i.e. a teacher with a peer tutor or TA).According toWAC 181-82-110,teachers who
are assigned to teach a subject that is out of their endorsement areamust be approved by a formal vote
of the School Board.
Administrative Considerations:
During the master scheduling process, principals attempt to limit the number of TOF assignments.
However, when teachers are placed in these situations, it is based on their experience, background, and
ability to effectively teach those subjects. These teachers are also provided support through PLC teams
in those subjects and other resources as needed.

Submitted by:
Brian Lewis, Executive Director of Operations
Background Information:
Each year the School Board considers and selects a district-wide enrollment estimate for the coming school year.The presentation discusses
sources of information and rationale for a range of enrollment estimates.
Administrative Considerations:
The enrollment projection is used to estimate revenues from the state for basic education allocations and participation in programs like Child
Nutrition and Pupil Transportation programs. The enrollment projection is also used to guide decision-making about appropriate certificated,
classified, and other support staffing needs in the coming school year. The enrollment projection and decision-making stemming from it, are
not factors viewed in isolation, but in the context of other available information. For the 2024-2025 school year, staff are recommending use
of the enrollment projection generated by the April Roll-Up method.
Budgetary Impact:
The enrollment projection is the basis for budgetary decision making for upcoming school years
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:
The enrollment estimate is used to anticipate staffing levels for the upcoming school year. Delaying the decision beyond the first meeting in
March could inhibit the ability of district administration to make needed changes in staffing.
