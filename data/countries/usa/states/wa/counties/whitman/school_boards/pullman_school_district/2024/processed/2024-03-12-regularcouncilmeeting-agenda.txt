Public Content
The State of Washington chose March 15, 2024, as the effective date for the Washington State
Building Code updates. Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 19.97 requires cities and counties
to adopt and enforce the Washington Building Code. Historically, the new codes have been
implemented every three years, which would have originally made the effective date of the 2021
codes July 1, 2023. The Washington State Building Code Council (SBCC) delayed the effective
date to October 29, 2023, and then delayed it again to March 15, 2024, due to pending litigation.
The Washington State Building Code consists of five (5) model codes with state amendments.
The model codes are the International Building Code (IBC), International Residential Code
(IRC), International Mechanical Code (IMC), International Fuel Gas Code (IFGC) published by
the International Code Council, and the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) published by the
International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials. The State of Washington has
amended all of the model codes. The Washington State Energy Code is a stand-alone state
code. The National Electrical Code (NEC) is adopted by the State of Washington but is not part
of the Washington State Building Code. These codes are adopted in the citys Construction
Code, Title 2 of the Pullman City Code (PCC).
Title 2 has a number of minor revisions, including references to the new code editions being the
most current edition as adopted by the State of Washington and the removal of the City of
Pullman gas fitters license requirement (which was in addition to the state-recognized trade
license requirements). Attached is a copy of Title 2 of the PCC showing the proposed additions
or deletions to the Construction Code.

Recommended Action :

Staff recommends a motion to approve the resolution
authorizing the payment of $40,000.00 to Whitman County
for the Chipman Trail Bridge Replacement Project.

Public Content
On August 19, 2023, Chipman Trail Bridge #5 (located between Alpine Animal Hospital - 4853
WA-270 & 5101 WA-270) was damaged by an arson fire. The bridge was not covered under
Whitman County's liability insurance coverage (consistent with all bridges in their transportation
network). The bridge was temporarily closed and inspected by the Whitman County Bridge Crew
Foreman and determined it needed replaced.
On March 12, 1997, the City of Pullman, City of Moscow, Washington State University,
University of Idaho, and Whitman County entered into an agreement for sharing maintenance
and operation costs, and implementing operational procedures for the Palouse Trail, aka
Chipman Trail. The agreement furtherestablished a committee to be known as the Palouse Trail
Committee (PTC), which consists of five members with one member representing each of the
entities. Currently, each entity contributes $10,000 annually to a fund that provides for routine
maintenance and also builds a reserve fund for future capital projects.
Section 3.3 of the agreement between entities states from time to time there may be a need to
expend funds for (such things as bridge maintenance or replacement, path reconstruction, or

renovation) capital costs that exceed the amount available from annual contributions. In these
cases, each Entity may be approached with a request from the PTC for additional contributions
and may participate on a case-by-case basis.
At the February 13, 2024 Palouse Trail Committee meeting, members agreed to make a request
to each entities governing/legislative bodies for $40,000 towards the replacement cost of the
bridge, with $50,000 being used from existing trail fund reserves.At the February 14, 2024 Parks
& Recreation Commission meeting, committee members passed a motion recommending the
approval $40,000 funding from Pullman, but not with Metro-Parks funds.
Estimated cost on replacement of the bridge is $250,000. Whitman County is taking the lead on
the bridge project and their own bridge crew will be performing the work. Whitman County
Commissioners support this proposal and are willing to contribute their share of $40,000 to the
project and also willing to cover any costs beyond $250,000.
This expenditure is not budgeted in 2024, and a future budget amendment at the end of the year
is expected.

GIS Software Budget - 510-5800-51880-4155

Recommended Action :

Staff recommends authorizing the Mayor to enter the Esri
Small Municipal and County Government Enterprise
Agreement to maintain the services provided by the existing
GIS software installation, to support increased user licensing
demand, to meet new server requirements of planned
business systems, and to waive public bid requirements in
line with Procurement Policy 1.107.130.

Public Content
Since the inception of the GIS Program prior to January 2021 the City of Pullman has
used the Esri ArcGIS platform and purchased software and user licenses on a
piecemeal basis. Successful growth of the program has meant that the existing
licensing is no longer sufficient for current use and anticipated growth.
The cost of continuing to purchase the required software and licenses in a piecemeal
fashion will exceed the cost of the enterprise agreement negotiated with Esri, the
software vendor.
Funds budgeted in 2024 cover the cost of the first year of the agreement. Funding for
the remaining two years would be addressed in the 2025-2026 budget process (
Procurement Policy 1.107.130).
Implementation of GIS at the City of Pullman has transformed the way we use data to
monitor city resources, make data-driven decisions, and communicate. The program's
successful growth has meant that the existing licensing is insufficient for current use
and anticipated growth.
The City of Pullman GIS provides desktop mapping and analysis software to power
users, provides GIS data and map servers to integrated business systems, and
provides a web portal for users to view, create, and analyze spatial data to more
effectively manage City resources under their care, and provides mobile GIS
applications so field crews can maintain operational views of systems under their care.
The benefits of the SGEA include:
Unlimited desktop licenses for growing numbers of users producing high-quality
maps and maintaining complex data sets such as utility networks, land parcel
fabrics, and road condition asset management.
Additional server licenses to support existing business system integrations as
well as new servers for anticipated roles in asset management software.
Sophisticated analytic tool licenses that expand return on investment made in
creating data.
Reduced costs of license administration.

Expanded access for users of the WebGIS to create and maintain spatial
information.
Funds for an SGEA were allocated during the 2023-2024 budgeting process. Esri has
offered the City of Pullman a ramped entry into the SGEA three-year commitment at
considerable savings.

Recommended Action :

Staff recommends a motion to approve the fee
schedule as presented.

Public Content
Permit fee schedules are set by the City Council by Resolution per City of Pullman
Construction Code sections 2.15.020, 2.20.020, and 2.25.020. The last time permit
fees were revised was 2021. The fee resolution proposed consists of exhibits A, B, C,
and D. The only proposed changes are in exhibit A. Below is a brief explanation of
the fee changes proposed.

Demolition permit: Demolition permits can require increased staff time and
resources in order to safeguard the public. The graduated fee schedule for
commercial structures (IBC) offsets the cost of pre-construction meetings, site
inspections, and pedestrian safety plan reviews while still keeping residential (IRC)
demolition permits flat rate with no change.
Retaining Wall permit: Currently, permits are calculated by multiplying the square
footage of the wall by $15.00 to establish the valuation of the wall. Contractor
estimated valuations are often 3-5 times that of our calculated value; and sometimes
as much as 8 times. Increasing the multiplier to $30.00 would offset the cost of the
structural review, field inspections, and special inspection supervision required, while
still keeping the value substantially less than contractor valuation.
Adult Family Home permit: This is meant to keep the permit inexpensive and flat
rate to facilitate the need for Adult Family Home care facilities. When converting a
single-family home to an Adult Family Home, a change of occupancy is needed. Also,
review and inspections are needed to ensure the facility meets the life/safety
requirements for the State Licensed care facility.
Residential Rooftop Solar permit: This proposal is meant to keep the permit
inexpensive and flat rate to facilitate renewable energy in residential settings.
Currently, the valuation of the project is used. The values can vary from
$8,000-$20,00 as an example. A flat rate permit would offset city resources
reviewing, permitting, and inspecting while keeping the permit inexpensive regardless
of the valuation.
Signs: Currently there is not a clear fee structure to capture the time and resources
for plan review, permitting, and inspecting signs as a structure. This would give clear
direction for permitting signs both mechanically fastened to buildings and as separate
structures such as: monuments, poles, and pedestals.
Foundation permits: The foundation only permit has not been utilized in my tenure.
The Early start/Phased permit that currently exists is the mechanism to facilitate
citizens who wish to perform phased construction. Deletion of this portion would
remove confusion and redundancies.

While preparing for Project Downtown to commence in April 2024, city staff has been
meeting regularly since 2023Q3 to address transportation and parking activities that
are expected to be disrupted during construction build-out.
The result of these meetings was an initial parking and transportation plan, which was
vetted by the Project Manager, Welch Comer, and presented to the Mayor & City
Council on February 27, 2024. The Project Manager has been further refining the
plan with the contractor, Apollo Inc., and debuted it to the public at an open house
event on February 29, 2024.
As part of staff discussion and discussed during the initial presentation to the City
Council on February 27th, staff recommends the creation of a project-specific Ad-Hoc
Parking and Transportation Committee with certain authorities for the duration of the
project.
This recommendation's importance centers around the ability to respond efficiently
and react quickly to unanticipated issues and changing conditions that may arise
during project construction and to maintain and maximize services and operations by
addressing temporary solutions in the affected area.
The recommended affected area is primarily the C-2 zone (see attached map). This
area was selected because it is already defined, encompasses most of the activity
that the project is anticipated to affect, and parking in this area is regulated by
existing codes, ordinances, and resolutions.

As previously presented to the City Council, the recommended members of this
committee remain:
Mayor, acting as Chairperson - (Francis Benjamin)
City Councilmember appointed as Mayor Pro-Tempore (Pat Wright)
City Councilmember appointed as Alternate Mayor Pro-Tempore (Eric Fejeran)
Chief of Police (Jake Opgenorth)
City Engineer (Cara Haley)
Fire Marshal (Darren Jones)
In addition, the Project Manager will make available the email address 'I
nfo@ProjectDowntownPullman.org' for the community to communicate any
requests for changes the Ad Hoc Parking and Transportation Committee should take
under consideration. To help the Project Manager timely expedite such requests,
please start the subject line of the email with either 'Parking' or 'Transportation.'
Furthermore, staff will create a landing page on the city website to include
explanation of this process, appropriate links outlining activities, and cataloging the
committee's actions.
