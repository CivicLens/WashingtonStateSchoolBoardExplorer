Fort Colville Elementary School
Student Enrollment: 353.84
★

Fort Colville ASB held elections at the end of September and we are looking forward to seeing what they
have planned! Our fundraiser is underway with students selling items from the “Tis’ the Season”
fundraiser catalog.

★

Fort Colville held their Bingo for Books/Parent/Family Engagement Night on Wednesday, October 2nd from
5:00 to 7:00pm. The goal of this night was sharing our curriculum, explaining what Title 1 is and how it
helps students, and ways to support learning at home. We had a very successful evening with a lot of
parents and families present.

★

Mrs. Johansen organized our Scholastic Book Fair the week of September 30th through October 5th. This
event is a fundraiser for our library and provides families with an opportunity to celebrate reading. We
were very appreciative of the turnout and support for our readers!

★

Teachers are in the process of scheduling Parent/Teacher conferences for October 31st and November 1st.
The conferences will take place in person or by phone. Our goal is 100% contact.

★

We are continuing to struggle finding substitute teachers and para subs for coverage. When we don’t have
teaching subs, we either split the class and add 5-6 kids to each of the other classes, or we have to shut down
a program (PE, Tech, Library, Music or Intervention) so that a teacher can cover the class.

★

This is our third year of implementing PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Support). Students earn
points for displaying our 4 expectations S - Show self control, O - Offer kindness, A -Act responsibly, R Respect self and others. Students can then use their points to redeem treats, toys and experiences every 3
weeks from the Falcon’s Nest (PBIS Store).

★

Professional Development - Several staff are participating in LETRS training designed to help teachers
understand the science of teaching students how to read. This will include 4 full days in Spokane and
approximately 60 hours of “homework” throughout this school year.

★

All Fort Colville teachers and paras are participating in a book study/professional development called
Conscious Discipline. This program will help us improve our school culture and reduce the amount of
academic time lost due to misbehavior.

★

Students are very excited to dress up for Halloween!

The first week of October started off with painting the new basketball courts at Fort Colville Elementary and the
pickle ball courts at Colville Junior High School.
The elevator at Fort Colville suffered a major breakdown. The ram or jack that sends the car up or down has failed.
Preparations have been made to replace the existing elevator system and car. We are in the scheduling process now
as the part that failed is made when ordered. I will keep you posted as I get more information.
The second week of the month we brought all of our heating boilers out of layup. Every year we turn off our heating
and before it is brought back online, we check all safeties and perform a combustion analysis.
The third week, Interstate Asphalt brought in crushed rock and installed two 12 inch culverts at Fort Colville. This
will be the base of a new handicap accessible path to our new play equipment. The asphalt is scheduled to be
installed the week of October 28th.

prepping to install a new sign at the pickle ball courts. We will be blowing out the irrigation systems beginning
