Presentations: 2. Pullman Housing Work Group
Councilmember Megan Guido gave an update on the work the Pullman Housing Work Group
has done over the past two years since its creation.
In October of 2023, the City Council voted to change the city code defining accessory living
quarters and allowing non-family members to rent an accessory building, also known as a
mother-in-law unit, accessory dwelling unit, or granny flat carriage house. Accessory dwelling
units were identified as an option to provide more accessibility and attainability of housing. The
Work Group made the recommendation to the planning committee.
The Planning Committee vetted it and forwarded a recommendation to the City Council. The City
Council voted to change that to allow non-family members to occupy the accessory buildings.
Nils Peterson with Moscow Land Trust has been speaking at civic groups to talk about a
community land trust model, which has been successful in Moscow, where Community Land
Trust owns the property; however, the homeowner purchases the house, making it less
expensive with not owning the property.
The Pullman Housing Work Group will host a Community Housing resource fair on Saturday,
September 14, 2024, at Gladish Community Center for community members to learn about
homeownership. Representatives from the Washington State Housing Finance Commission,
Washington Homeownership Resource Center, and Mortgage company Homesite will be onsite
to answer questions.
The Pullman Housing Work Group applied for and received a Missing Middle Housing Grant
from the Department of Commerce. The Group will use the grant funds to assess the missing
middle housing in Pullman, with anticipated results delivered to the Council in 2025.

Deputy Public Works Director Clayton Forsmann explained that this project only involves
designing and permitting work on Airport Road. The project begins at Terre View Drive and
terminates at the east city limit line near Orville Boyd Road. This project aligns with the
City’s adopted complete streets policy. It includes a roundabout at the intersection with NE
Terre View Drive, a curb and gutter, a continuous center turn/refuge lane, a 12-foot wide
joint-use bike/pedestrian path along the south side of Airport Road for the length of the
project, a 7-foot wide sidewalk along the north side and transit system access to the airport.
At their June 6, 2023 meeting, the City Council authorized the execution of a Rebuilding
American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) Grant Agreement to fund
this design and permitting work. The funding amount is $1,050,000, with no local match
required.
To select a consultant for this work, staff solicited statements of qualifications from qualified
consultants. The solicitation was prepared to include all required federal provisions and a
14% mandatory DBE (Disadvantaged Business Enterprises) goal, which was necessary to
comply with U.S. DOT and WSDOT federal requirements. The solicitation was advertised
in the Moscow-Pullman Daily News, the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce, and the
Washington Office of Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises bid and contracting
webpage.
Three statements of qualifications were received and evaluated by staff, followed by a
telephone interview of each firm. The firm selected through this process was Parametrix,
Inc. A scope and budget were then determined and negotiated with Parametrix, Inc. The
full scope of work is attached as Exhibit A to the Local Agency A&E Professional Services
Cost Plus Fixed Fee Consultant Agreement. The project will be performed on a cost-plus
fixed fee basis with an estimated budget of $1,019,976. Once the project is fully designed,
staff can seek construction grant funding, which is necessary to move forward from design
to construction.
City Staff seeks City Council authorization to execute a Local Agency A&E Professional
Services Cost Plus Fixed Fee Consultant Agreement between the City of Pullman and
Parametrix, Inc. for the Airport Road Multimodal & Regional Access Improvements project.
