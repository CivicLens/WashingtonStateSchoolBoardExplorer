YAKAMA LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Today, the schools of the Yakima School District rest on the ancestral lands of the fourteen
Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. The people of Yakama Nation inhabited
more than 12 million acres across Adams, Benton, Chelan, Douglas, Franklin, Grant, Kittitas,
Klickitat, and Yakima counties. Today, we honor those native peoples who are tied to the land
through history, legends, and culture. We acknowledge their descendants who live in the world
today.

We thank the caretakers of this land, who have lived here and continue to live here since time
immemorial. An acknowledgment is a simple, powerful way to show respect, and a step toward
correcting the stories and practices that erase indigenous peoples history and culture. It also
honors the truth. As a school district, we will continue to build upon our relations with the
Yakama Nation.
