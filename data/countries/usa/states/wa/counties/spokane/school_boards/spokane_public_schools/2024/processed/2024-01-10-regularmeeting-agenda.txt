Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

TOTAL

$119,669.17

Background:
The district purchases approximately $200,000 of custodial supplies annually that are stocked in the warehouse and supplied to
schools as needed. The bid climate for these products does not produce the best pricing if the product price is held for an
extended period, much like copier paper. In order to obtain the best possible pricing, a solicitation will be issued every 3-4
months. Given the total expenditure for the product requires a bid, each purchase will be solicited as a formal bid. The
Purchasing office utilizes an electronic solicitation system, Public Purchase, which allows for efficient solicitation and tabulation
making more frequent solicitations possible.

All recommended awards are to the low responsible bidder offering acceptable products. In the event that products identified are
determined unacceptable for district use or the vendor is unable to provide the product as bid, it is further recommended that
authorization be granted to proceed to the next low bidder(s) and award to that bidder whose product fully meets acceptance
criteria. Actual purchase orders may be adjusted slightly to accommodate specific product packing quantities.

Type :

Public Content
Recommendation:
Approval of the enclosed Interlocal Agreements with Kahlotus School District for the purpose of forming a reciprocal
purchasing partnership.
Background:
An Interlocal Agreement has been requested by Kahlotus School District in accordance with RCW 39.34, the Interlocal
Cooperation Act. The main purpose of executing this contract is to allow this school district the ability to access our
districts Nutrition Services vendor contracts in support of their nutrition services program; however, it also grants authority
for our district to access the other districts procurement contracts in place over time, if needs arise. Our solicitations have
incorporated the required cooperative purchasing provision per RCW 39.34 so that districts interested in accessing our
contracts need only enter into an Interlocal Agreement with our district to do so. Currently, 90 Washington, Northern
Idaho and Northeastern Oregon school districts, charter schools and Educational Service Districts have opted to enter
into an Interlocal Agreement with our district for this purpose. Pending board approval, Kahlotus School District will join
that list.
With the additional procurement volume generated as a result of our Interlocal Agreements, Spokane Public Schools has
realized a substantial benefit in lower costs. Our Prime Vendor contract volume pricing has been elevated into the
premium buying bracket which lowers our own food costs and makes us eligible for more manufacturers rebates. Overall,
for just this one contract, it is estimated that our district has saved between 2.5% and 4% of our own $5M contract
annually due to the Interlocal Agreements we have entered into with the smaller entities. Also, by entering into these
agreements and allowing access to existing contracts, it saves the smaller sites not only the administrative costs of
issuing their own separate solicitation and awarded contract but increases their buying power for the purchases
supporting their meal programs. These agreements have been found to be consistent with state statutory requirements.
There will be no district expenditures or liabilities as a result of these agreements and the districts administrative costs to
process these agreements are nominal.

Recommendation:
Issuance of a purchase order to Structured Communications Systems, Inc., Liberty Lake, WA, in the amount of $123,930.94 for
network optics for the dark fiber conversion project.

Background:
This recommended award is for network optics to replace outdated existing equipment. The recommended hardware is needed
to connect the new dark fiber network that the district will be converting to this summer as well as establish a foundation for more
resiliency in the districts internet service. The district anticipates the recommended optics life cycle to be 10-15 years.
This recommended expenditure will be funded through bond dollars for technology infrastructure and is accessing Washington
State Department of Enterprise Contract No. 05819 and is considered fair and reasonable.

Recommendation:
Approval of the estimated expenditures in the amount of $750,000 to Maxim Healthcare Services for healthcare services
behavioral aides for district students.
Background:
As the district continues to struggle with the hiring of paraeducators, these expenditures provide for additional staffing services to
support the complexity of needs students are presenting at school.The district will utilize the services of Maxim Behavioral Aides
through the remainder of the 2023-24 school year as necessary to support these students. However, the district continues to
diligently recruit, with the hope that we will have sufficient in-house staffing by the end of the 2023-24 school year or the
beginning of the 2024-25 school year.
