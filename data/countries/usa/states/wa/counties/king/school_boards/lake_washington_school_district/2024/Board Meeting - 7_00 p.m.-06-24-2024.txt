Department Of Enterprise Services (DES) Contracts,
Resolution No. 2377

Meeting :

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Adopt Resolution No. 2377 authorizing the Superintendent
or designee to enter into a Contract Usage Agreement
authorizing purchases from or through admissible State of
Washington Department of Enterprise Services (DES)
contracts.

Public Content
SITUATION:
The State of Washingtons Department of Enterprise Services (DES) is requiring all state agencies to sign
a new Contract Usage Agreement to maintain access to statewide contracts for goods and services
under RCW 39.26.050. New agreements must be in place by June 30, 2024 to continue purchasing
through DES contracts. This is agreement was last updated on October 26, 2015 with what was General
Services Administration (GSA) at the time.
Statewide contracts leverage the States collective buying power allowing the district to save money, time
and streamline purchasing. The District utilizes DES contracts to purchase a wide variety of goods and
services from specified contractors at contracted prices, terms, and conditions. The district has spent
approximately $7.5 million on purchases through DES contracts for the 23-24 school year. Some
examples of purchases the district has made through DES contracts include:
Buses
Student and staff laptop devices
Software licenses
Elevator service agreements
The approval to purchase from or through DES will continue the districts options for highly competitive
pricing for products and services available under this program.
RECOMMENDATION:
The Board of Directors adopts Resolution No. 2377 authorizing the Superintendent or designee to enter
into a Contract Usage Agreement authorizing purchases from or through admissible State of Washington
Department of Enterprise Services (DES) contracts.

8. Direction Of Selected Capital Fund Investments To
The General Fund, Resolution No. 2378

Meeting :

Jun 24, 2024 - Board Meeting - 7:00 p.m.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Approve Resolution No. 2378 and authorizes the
Superintendent to direct the King County Treasurer to
deposit into the General Fund, $300,000 of future capital
fund investment earnings for the purpose of purchasing
instructional supplies and equipment. Such authorization will
remain in force through August 31, 2025.

Public Content
SITUATION:
RCW 28A.320.320 allows a school district to direct the county treasurer to deposit all or portions of
interest earnings from capital fund investments to the general fund. Such deposits may only be used for
instructional materials and equipment. During the 2024-25 budget year, the district anticipates purchasing
at least $300,000 of curriculum adoption materials, other instructional supplies, and equipment necessary
for the operations of the district. As a result of the prudent investment practices, receipt of state-match
funds for construction and use of impact and mitigation fees, the district has identified $300,000 of capital
investment interest earnings as not being required for the immediate capital needs of the district. Through
the approval of Resolution No. 2378, the Board would authorize the district to instruct the King County
Treasurer to deposit $300,000 of capital investment earnings into the General Fund. The districts bond
counsel has reviewed this proposed action and found it allowed by law. The districts bond counsel has
reviewed Resolution No. 2378 and found it to be legally sufficient.

RECOMMENDATION:
The Board of Directors approves Resolution No. 2378 and authorizes the Superintendent to direct the
King County Treasurer to deposit into the General Fund, $300,000 of future capital fund investment
earnings for the purpose of purchasing instructional supplies and equipment. Such authorization will
remain in force through August 31, 2025.

9. Capital Facilities Plan

Meeting :

Jun 24, 2024 - Board Meeting - 7:00 p.
m.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Public Content
SITUATION
The State of Washington Growth Management Act permits the collection of impact fees as a means to partially pay for the cost of providing new building
capacity to serve students necessitated by new development. As a requirement for the collection of impact fees, the Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan must
be updated annually.
The Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan, 2024-2029, includes current enrollment projections, a current inventory of facilities, projects from Phase I of the
Building Excellence Plan (approved by voters in February 2022), Phase II of the Building Excellence Plan (anticipated for November 2024), and related
facilities planning. This plan also recognizes the Districts continuing efforts to secure real property for the Districts educational purposes.
The State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) requires that the district consider the environmental impacts of this proposal. The Associate Superintendent of
Business and Support Services, as the responsible official of the school district as lead agency, has determined that the proposed plan will not have a
probable significant adverse impact on the environment. The notice of this determination was published on June 3, 2024, and the comment period ended
on June 17, 2024. The District did not receive any comments that necessitated revisions to the Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan.

The 2024-2029 Capital Facilities Plan establishes impact fees of $5,972 per single-family unit and $0 for each multi-family unit. The single-family fee is an
increase of $823 and the multi-family fee is a decrease of $352 from last years fees. The increase in the single-family fee is primarily due to increased
student generation rates and the decrease in the multi-family fees are primarily due to decreased student generation rates.
A presentation was provided to the board at the study session prior to the board meeting.
RECOMMENDATION
The Board of Directors adopts the Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan, 2024-2029.

Public Content
SITUATION
During the 2023-24 school year, the district experienced various emergency situations which resulted in decisions to close individual schools. During these
closures all other district schools operated as scheduled. WAC 392-129-145 requires the district to report the closure to the Office of the Superintendent of
Public Instruction (OSPI). Due to the isolated nature of the closure, it was not logistically possible to make up the day at each school. The district will still
meet the district-wide minimum instructional hours requirement. WAC 392-129-150 permits OSPI to excuse up to two days of school per incident for
unforeseen situations while still providing the full funding allocation.
Below is a table showing the specific incidents and reasons:

in opposition to the ballot measure (pro and con statements). Members are to be appointed from
persons known to favor or oppose the measure. If such persons are not immediately known, the
district must notify the public that members of the proponent or opponent committee are being
sought.
Since the district has an established promotional committee, Lake Washington Citizens Levy

statement. Since no formal ongoing opposition committee is known to exist, the district
employed formal means of notifying the public that the district was seeking interested community
members to participate in writing an opposition statement. On June 4, a notice was posted on
the districts website seeking interested persons and asking them to notify the district of their
interest by June 17.
The Lake Washington Citizens Levy Committee has provided names of three members to write

Services.
While we are required to provide the Board with the OSPI-provided copy of our answers to the survey
questions(linked below), the introduction and questions themselves are not provided. We requested the
full text of the survey to provide the Board with the additional context, also attached below.

Hearing

Meeting :

Jun 24, 2024 - Board Meeting - 7:00 p.m.

Type :

Action, Information, Procedural

Recommended Action :

Adopt Resolution No. 2379 increasing the 2023-24
General Fund appropriation amount from $556,155,096
to $568,155,096.

Public Content
SITUATION:
When the Board of Directors approved the 2023-24 budget in August 2023, it established the maximum
level of expenditures the district could incur. That maximum level was established based on information
that was known at the time and prior expenditure patterns. As a result of revenues and expenditures
related to the special education high-cost Safety Net Award, transportation, and new accounting
requirements for subscription and lease financing, there is a possibility that actual expenditures may
exceed the general fund budgeted amount.
Accordingly, staff has proposed a budget extension to increase the appropriation limit by $12,000,000.
The beginning fund balance and additional revenues received during the year provide the funds
necessary to meet this expenditure level.The appropriate public notices have been published in the local
newspaper.
Included is the state format for budget extensions showing the budget changes.
RECOMMENDATION:
The Board of Directors adopts Resolution No. 2379 increasing the 2023-24 General Fund appropriation
amount from $556,155,096 to $568,155,096.
