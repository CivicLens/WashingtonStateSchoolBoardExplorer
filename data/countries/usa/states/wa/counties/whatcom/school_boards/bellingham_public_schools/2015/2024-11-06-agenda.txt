2.6 Resolution 26-15, Bond Refunding

Meeting :

Oct 8, 2015 - Regular Meeting, 6:15 p.
m.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached Resolution 26-15 authorizing
the sale of bonds and the refinancing of existing bonds,
subject to market conditions, later this year. As noted below,
this is a "delegation resolution." As Superintendent, I have
reviewed and approve adoption of this resolution, and am
submitting it as a consent item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Simone Sangster, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations
Explanation of Issue:
The attached resolution authorizes the sale of up to $25 million of bonds associated with our $160 million bond issue approved by the
Districts voters at an election held on November 5, 2013. In addition, the resolution authorizes the sale of up to $13.7 million of bonds to
refund (refinance) certain existing bonds at lower interest rates, if market conditions are favorable for doing so. For the bonds to be refunded,
the refunded issue must yield a true savings on debt service. The actual bond sale is currently scheduled for December 2, 2015, subject to
market conditions.
Attached is resolution 26-15, a bond delegation for your consideration. A'delegation resolution' grants temporaryauthority to the
Superintendent to approve the final structure and interest rates associated with the bonds and to execute the sale of bonds. The advantage
of a delegation resolution is that it allows the district to quickly enter the bond market when conditions are favorable, irrespective of the
timing of a board meeting, within the bounds of the parameters established in the resolution. Without a delegation resolution, the district's
only option is to enter the bond market on the date of a regular or special board meeting which may or may not be a date that is most
advantageous to the district. You will notice several blanks throughout the document related to the form of bonds and exhibits. These are
provisions that will be determined as we get closer to the sale date. We will provide the board with a report describing the final terms after
the bonds are sold.

2.7 Resolution 27-15, Authorize Superintendent to
Submit Application to Purchase Property

Meeting :

Oct 8, 2015 - Regular Meeting, 6:15 p.m.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

Staff submitted the attached Resolution 27-15 in connection
with a recommendation to acquire a small parcel of land
adjacent to the current Options High School site. As noted
below, this acquisition will enhance the design and site plan
of the new Options High School. As Superintendent, I have
reviewed and approve adoption of this resolution and am
submitting it as a consent item.

Public Content
Staff Contact: Ron Cowan, Executive Director of Capital Projects and School Facilities
Explanation of Issue:
As you know, the current Options High School site is rather small. In reviewing possible nearby adjacent properties to acquire we discovered
a small triangular shaped parcel. Weve been researching this property for a couple of months (there was some question about ownership)
and it is now clear that it is owned by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF). Even though this is a small parcel acquisition it would
enhance the design and site plan associated with the new Options High School by allowing us to square up and move the new building
south, creating space for much needed additional parking.
In an attempt to move the process along as quickly as possible (we cannot begin the permitting process until we finalize the parcel(s) we will
actually be using for the new school), the attached resolution authorizes the superintendent to submit an application to purchase this parcel
within certain parameters, including a formal appraisal prior to the submission of the application.
