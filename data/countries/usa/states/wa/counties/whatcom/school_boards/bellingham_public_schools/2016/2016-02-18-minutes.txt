Board President Camille Diaz Hackler called the meeting to order at 6:15 p.m. Present:
Directors Kelly Bashaw, Douglas Benjamin, Camille Diaz Hackler, Quenby Peterson,
Steven Smith, Superintendent Greg Baker, and recorder Ruth Rasmussen.
Audience – no audience presented
Superintendent’s Announcements and Report: Summary of Dr. Baker’s comments:
 Levies: On Feb. 9, Bellingham voters overwhelmingly approved renewal of the
district’s two expiring levies. Votes in favor were at historically high levels:
operations levy: 74.6 percent; technology levy: 73.0 percent. Dr. Baker thanked
the board of directors, Executive Team, Citizens Advisory Committee and
community members for their efforts in support of the levies, which fund about
25% of the district’s budget.
 Staff Learning Fridays: A recent video describing staff learning day activities has
generated positive responses from families and staff.
 2016-17 Budget: The district’s 2016-17 budget hearings are scheduled for March
3 and 4. On the state level, the legislature is not expected to make significant
changes to the education budget this year, despite sanctions imposed by the
Washington State Supreme Court for failure to meet the court’s deadline to fairly
fund public schools.
 Capital projects: Executive Director Ron Cowan updated the board on current
work of the New Sehome High School Educational Specifications/Design
Advisory Committee and the High School Turf Fields Advisory Group
 Congratulations Dr. Copland: During a recent gathering at the district office,
music teachers and other staff came together to congratulate Mike Copland who
was named Administrator of the Year by the Washington Music Educators
Association. This honor is in recognition of his exemplary work in support of
music education.
CONSENT ITEMS:
Ms. Diaz Hackler said she will recuse herself from voting on consent agenda item 2.3,
Approvals of Expenditures and Payroll – January 2016, and she asked that this item be
separated from the rest of the consent agenda for voting purposes. The board agreed to
this request.
