Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation:
Issuance of purchase orders as indicated in the summary below for the total amount of $122,427.88.

Insight Distribution, Spokane, WA

$ 41,098.24

KCDA, Kent, WA

1,388.70

Merchants Paper Co., Portland, OR

67,871.56

West Coast Paper Solutions, Spokane, WA

12,069.38

TOTAL

$122,427.88

Background:
The district purchases approximately $300,000 of non-food consumables annually that are stocked in the warehouse and
supplied to schools as needed. The bid climate for these products does not produce the best pricing if the product price is held
for an extended period, much like copier paper. In order to obtain the best possible pricing a solicitation will be issued every 3-4
months. Given the total expenditure for the product requires a bid, each purchase will be solicited as a formal bid. The
Purchasing office utilizes an electronic solicitation system, Public Purchase, which allows for efficient solicitation and tabulation
making more frequent solicitations possible.
This bid includes items for use by Nutrition Services for food preparation and serving, such as plastic bags, foil, cups, boats, and
utensils. Due to current economic times, paper products, such as paper boats and bowls, which are the majority of these items,
are subject to availability. Also, pricing is subject to manufacturer increase. Any price increase will be verified by written notice
from the mill.
All recommended awards are to the low responsible bidder offering acceptable products. In the event that products identified are
determined unacceptable for district use or the vendor is unable to provide the product as bid, it is further recommended that
authorization be granted to proceed to the next low bidder(s) and award to that bidder whose product fully meets acceptance
criteria. Actual purchase orders may be adjusted slightly to accommodate specific product packaging quantities.
