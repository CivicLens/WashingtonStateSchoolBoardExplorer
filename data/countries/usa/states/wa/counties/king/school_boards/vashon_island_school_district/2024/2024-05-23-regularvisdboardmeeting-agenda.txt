Public Comment: The Vashon Island School Board recognizes the value of public comment on educational issues. We are
pleased to provide the opportunity for addressing the board during regular Board meetings. Public comment is not taken
during Board work sessions or special meetings. The agenda limits the public comment period to 15 minutes. Community
members who wish to make a public comment must complete the sign-in sheet upon arrival and will be called to speak for
the allotted 3-minutes in the order they sign in. Consistent with our equity policy, there is no mechanism whereby a speaker
can donate some or all of their time to another speaker. As a matter of practice, the Board will listen to all comments,
however, will not respond to comments or engage in dialogue at the meeting.
Community Input: The Board also encourages community input at any time on educational issues. The public is welcomed
and encouraged to provide community comments in email to the VISD School Board atvashonschoolboard@vashonsd.org.

In accordance with the Open Public Meeting Act, any individual who has difficulty attending an in-person meeting by reason
of disability, limited mobility, or for any other reason that makes physical attendance at a meeting difficult, they may request
