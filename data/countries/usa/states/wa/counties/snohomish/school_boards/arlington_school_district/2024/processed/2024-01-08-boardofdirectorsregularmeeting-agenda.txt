Background Information:
We honor the first peoples of these lands by acknowledging that the area in which we gather is within the traditional territory of
theStillaguamish Tribe of Indians (stulg√°b).The Stillaguamish people have inhabited these lands and waters since time
immemorial and their ancestors have remained in this territory to this day. The Stillaguamish people have continued to practice
the traditional ways of their ancestors of fishing, hunting and gathering. The Stillaguamish Tribe has had these lands and cultural
traditions passed on to them by their ancestors who believed that everything has a spirit and that they are caretakers of these
lands and waters.
Administrative Considerations:
By honoring those who inhabited the land before us, we help to build understanding around the history of our land and its
Indigenous people, as well as set the tone for honoring all people who have been historically marginalized or underserved.
A land acknowledgement shares a commitment to honoring Native communities, educates all within a community in local history,
and can demonstrate a sustained commitment to building authentic community relationships to advance equity for all.

A. Budget & Enrollment Reports

Meeting :

Jan 8, 2024 - Board of Directors Regular
Meeting

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

That the Board approves the Budget and Enrollment
reports as presented.

Goals :

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
November Budget Reports:
Fund balance and net cash: The beginning fund balance for the 2023-24 year was $3.8 million. As of the end of November 2023, the fund
balance was $1.6 million (compared to $7.1 million last November 2022) and net cash is approximately $3.8 million (compared to $9.5
million last November 2022). These balances have decreased from the previous month which is the normal pattern at this time of year.
Consistent with prior year trends, fund balance, net cash, and revenues show a large spike in October from receipt of a large portion of local
property taxes. November then shows a decline especially since the state apportionment allocation in November is only 5% of the total
allocation versus 9% in other months. Fund balance and net cash will continue to decrease in the coming months as the influx of levy dollars
tapers down, until the next big influx in April. Meanwhile expenditures will remain at a fairly consistent monthly level.
Local Tax Revenue: The district has received 44% of total budgeted General Fund tax revenues for the 2023-24 fiscal year. Tax revenues
received year-to-date amount to $4.2 million of the $9.6 million budgeted.
State Apportionment Revenues: The district is expecting to experience an increase in the State Apportionment allocation since actual
average full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment is approximately 122 more than budgeted enrollment. The District requested OSPI to adjust
the enrollment figure used to disburse the District's monthly allocation, to a level that would more closely align with the increase in enrollment
that the district is experiencing. This will allow the district to receive needed revenues earlier and support cash flow levels for November. The
amount of the increase will be more evident with January's apportionment which is when the State makes its annual 'true-up' on its payments
to school districts. January is when the state adjusts from paying school districts based on budgeted average student FTE to payments
based on ACTUAL average student FTE. The increase in apportionment will be spread out from January to August and is estimated to be
between $1-1.5 million dollars.
December Enrollment Report:
The final December 2023 enrollment reports are submitted for Board review and approval. Actual enrollment for December 2023 was
5,446.44 FTE (Full-Time-Equivalent). December's enrollment decreased 1.12 FTE compared to November's enrollment. The average FTE
taking into consideration September through December monthly enrollments is 5,436.31. This is 122.31 FTE more than budgeted enrollment
of 5,314.00.
Compared to 2022-23 average enrollment, the district is serving approximately 73 more student FTE in 2023-24 than the year before.
Previous Board Action:
Board acceptance of Budget Reports for September 2023 and October 2023 occurred at the November 27, 2023, Regular Board Meeting.
November enrollment was approved by the Board during the November 27, 2023, Regular Board Meeting.

Background Information:
The Sno-Isle TECH Skills Center Consortium is currently comprised of 14 school districts with Mukilteo
School District 6 being the host district. Arlington Public Schools has been a consortium district of the
Sno-Isle Skills TECH Center for many years. The Inter-localCooperative Agreement for this consortiumis
on a ten year basis, and was last approved by the Board at the June 11, 2018 meeting.
A formal proposal was received from Stanwood-Camano School District #401 requesting to be admitted
to the Sno-Isle TECH Skills Center Consortium. On October 13, 2023, a quorum of the Sno-Isle TECH
Skills Center Administrative Council of the Sno-Isle TECH Skills Center voted unanimously to admit the

Stanwood-Camano School District #401 to the group of participating districts. According to the Interlocal
Cooperative Agreement, after this approval an amendment to the agreement must be approved by the
boards of directors of all the consortium districts before the new district can become a consortium
member. Resolution 24-01 Addition of Stanwood-Camano School District to the Sno-Isle TECH Skills
Center Consortium, would constitute Arlington Public Schools' approval of the admission of the StanwoodCamano School District to the Sno-Isle TECH Skills Center Consortium.
Administrative Considerations:
None.
Budgetary Impact:

Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:
Approval at the January 8 meeting would help expedite the admission of the Stanwood-Camano School
District into the consortium.

Goal 3: Resource Stewardship

Public Content
Submitted by:
Gina Zeutenhorst, Executive Director of Financial Services
Background Information:
Per request from the Traffic Safety Education Coordinator, an amendment to the student fee schedule is proposed to increase the Traffic
Safety Drivers Education Tuition Fee from $600 to $625, the written test fee from $45 to $50, and the drive skills test from $80 to $90. These
increases are requested to begin with the 3rd quarter which starts in February 2024. These changes are requested to cover increasing costs
such as staff salaries, gas, maintenance and insurance, and to allow for purchase of an additional drivers education car. The program

anticipates being able to provide an additional behind-the-wheel instructor, and with an additional car, would be able to accept more students
who apply and qualify instead of having to turn down students due to a cap created by the limited number of behind-the-wheel instructors
available to serve the program.
Private companies are also available to provide this class to teens in the community. Arlington Public Schools' Drivers Education Class is
priced in range with what private companies charge, and is a convenient option for students in Arlington.
Budgetary Impact:

Fees collected are used to offset the cost of providing the Traffic Safety Drivers Education class. The
intention is for the program to be self-supporting. Fees generated need to be sufficient to cover the direct
costs of the program and for the pricing structure to also allow for the occasional capital outlay to replace
or purchase additional drivers education cars. The District does not receive any state funding for this
optional program.
Previous Board Action:
The Board approved the 2023-24 Student Fee Schedule during the July 10, 2023 regular board meeting.
Time Sensitivity of Board Approval:
The Traffic Safety Education Coordinator needs to update appropriate application forms with the new rate for the next class registration intake, February 2024.
