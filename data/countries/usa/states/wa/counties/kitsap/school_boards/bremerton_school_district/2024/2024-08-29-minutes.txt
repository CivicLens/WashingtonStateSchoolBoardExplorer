  DISCUSSION/ACTION
Discussion: Unilateral Termination
Director Hurley shared that he understands the support of Dr. Crawford and that the facts have not been released so they were able to maintain the integrity of the initial investigation and overall process. His concerns began in December with Dr. Crawford not wanting board to meet with district staff. What broke him was Dr. Crawford’s dishonesty. He wants to instill integrity in our children and that didn't happen with Dr. Crawford. He read the definition of bullying and said that more information around that will be in the reports  released. Board has had their integrity challenged and have received unkind emails and texts. He challenges everyone to read through all information in the reports when they are finally available and see where the board is coming from.

Director Bolton shared that she wanted Dr. Crawford in our district. He was her friend and she had him in her home and for holidays. She is disgusted by former mayors and superintendents calling and texting her personal cell asking about the investigation. The board had to do their due diligence and she tried to protect Dr. Crawford. That is why the facts were not released. She is ashamed at how some of the community is acting. When she read the reports she was appalled. She said that she is available to talk to anyone and mend fences.

Director Perkins has been on the board in times of tribulation but she believes she has a duty and that is not to be influenced by people by facts. No one could see what was yet to come. She has seen horrendous behavior and is appalled. Her integrity has been questioned and she served on the board because she wanted integrity on board. They could not legally give out information before and they had to do everything to do their due diligence to get the truth. The decision made tonight is each individual's vote based on what they know is true.

Director Rotter shared that this is never something she ever thought she would be a part of. Her only agenda is doing what is best for our community and on behalf of the kids. The board’s job is to ensure fair and just processes. She has been really shocked and disappointed that long standing relationships have been put in a different place based on a lack of information. They have been very intentional to protect due process. She hopes that some individuals that have made personal attacks take a moment to pause and consider all of the information once made available.
  Director Bolton made a motion to unilaterally terminate Dr. James Crawford affective immediately. The motion carried unanimously.
  Discussion: Public Statement
Director Hurley made a motion to authorize releasing a public statement from the board of directors regarding superintendent’s employment, to include releasing the Ganson investigation report. The motion carried unanimously.
      ADJOURNMENT
At 5:59 pm, Director Perkins made a motion to adjourn the meeting. The motion carried unanimously.
