outpouring of support during the flood and response.
Mr. Galley personally thanked those in attendance, as all were
instrumental in providing time and resources: Kevin Devere, Katie

and Krista Briskey. Attached are several more names of people who
helped support the emergency shelters are Nooksack Elementary School
and Everson Elementary School.
Megan Wiseman delivered a brief statement also pointing out the heroic
efforts of our community to provide rescue and resources. She also

coalition. Steve Jones offered a sincere thank you to the community at
