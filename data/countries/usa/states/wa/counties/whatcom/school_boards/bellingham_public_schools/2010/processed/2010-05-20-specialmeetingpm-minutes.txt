Recommendation: The Acting Superintendent recommends approval.
Staff Contact: Karst Brandsma, Acting Deputy Superintendent
Background Information:
The Bellingham School District is requesting Board action to apply for three state waiver days. These
days will allow the District to continue to provide the highest quality of staff development for our staff by
utilizing larger blocks of time and reducing the number of early-release days. The State Board of
Education's authority to grant waivers from the Basic Education program requirement is RCW 28A.
305.140 and RCW 28A.655.180(1). The rules that govern requests for waivers are in WAC 180-18-030,
WAC 180-18-040, and WAC 180-18-050. This process is not new and has been in effect in the State of
Washington since the mid 1990s. Approximately 64 school districts in the state currently have been
granted a waiver from the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education respects the value of
teacher and student contact time. Waivers are exceptions from basic education program requirements in
that they provide exceptional opportunities for districts and schools to be innovative in enhancing the
educational program for all students while meeting the challenges of their school calendars.
Requested Action

We are requesting the School Board approve the Districts application to the State Board of Education for
a waiver from the minimum one hundred eighty-day school year requirement of the Basic Education
Program as allowed by law.

Recommendation: The Acting Superintendent recommends approval.
Staff Contact: Karst Brandsma, Acting Deputy Superintendent
Explanation of Issue:
Each year the Administration brings to the Board a recommended calendar for the following school year
for approval. The calendar for next year is a little unique. It offers additional overall minutes of instruction
by eliminating seven early release days and replacing them with a request to the State Board of
Education for a waiver from the required 180 day school year Basic Education Program, and replacing
the seven early release days with three full days. These days will be used to meet pre-determined goals
that are consistent with the Districts Identified Priorities. The calendar allows for three early release days
for building principals to use towards meaningful staff development activities that are aligned with their
building initiatives.
The calendar continues to support parent conferencing that is held during the month of November. It also
has typical school breaksthe day after Thanksgiving (November 26), winter break (December 20-31), midwinter break (February 18), and spring break (April 4-8)and Federal holidays that include Veterans Day
(November 11), Thanksgiving Day (November 25), Martin Luther King Day (January 17), Presidents Day
(February 21), and Memorial Day (May 30). The Boards approval will allow schools and programs to
communicate important calendar information and to publish the new kindergarten schedule, which
includes a change in regular kindergarten dates and time. These changes require regular kindergarten
students to attend all day every other day to meet their required 450 hours of instruction.
The Joint Calendar Committee has completed their process in reviewing this recommendation and they
have endorsed it for submittal to the Board for their consideration. The 177 student day calendar is
attached. In the event the State Board fails to approve the Districts request, October 11 and March 7
would become early release days and the last day of school for students and staff would be June 16.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.
