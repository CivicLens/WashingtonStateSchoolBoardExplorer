Dr. Kathi Weight, Superintendent

From: Shawn Lewis
Subject: Financial Update
Attached are the Budget Status Reports for all funds as of the end of September 2024, along
with charts and data showing our monthly attendance, general fund balance, and general fund
cash balance.
Our books for the 2023‐24 school year are substantially complete. We finished our last fiscal
year with a general fund ending total fund balance of $3.95 million and an
unreserved/unassigned fund balance of $3.25 million. This amount slightly exceeded the board
policy minimum fund balance percentage.
September expenditures are largely in line with expectations. Expenditures this year are higher
than last year primarily due to paying our property insurance bill ($375,000) in September ‐ one
month earlier than last year. We also had $300,000 of prepaid expenses that are already part
of our reserved fund balance.
Revenues were slightly under last year due to decreased enrollment and a delay in making
certain grant claims. We will be watching revenue trends closely.
Running start enrollment is less than 1 FTE different than projected. We budgeted 200 FTE and
October enrollment is currently reported at 200.75 FTE. Non‐running start enrollment is
trending slightly over projections which would be recognized as additional revenue in January if
the trend holds (approximately $230,000).
All other funds have expenditures, revenues and balances that are consistent with
expectations.

Steilacoom Historical School District Professional Development Center
511 Chambers Street, Steilacoom, WA
September 18, 2024
I.

CALL TO ORDER
Chair Scott called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m.
Executive Director Susanne Beauchaine led the Pledge of Allegiance.
Directors Lewis, McDonald, Rohrer, Scott, and Tinsley all present.
Chair Scott asked if anyone had any questions about the agenda. No questions.
Director McDonald made a motion to approve the agenda, Director Lewis seconded the motion, and the
motion passed (5/0).

II. PRESENTATION - School Opening Update
Dr. Weight shared a school opening update for the 2024-25 school year, including enrollment
information with each school as well as quotes from each district principal. She also shared information
about the district's new Transitional Kindergarten program, transportation, and food service. Finally, Dr.
Weight shared regarding the district's plans for the future including student achievement, school
improvement planning, enrollment and budget, and long range capital facilities planning.
Director Rohrer asked about the curriculum for Transitional Kindergarten, and about the district’s plans
for future enrollment to allow more than one TK class at each school. Dr. Weight shared there is not
available space at current primary schools to add more than one class, and TK curriculum is based on
kindergarten learning standards.
Director Tinsley asked if the TK program would be an all-day program. Dr. Weight shared it would be.
Director Tinsley also asked about transportation numbers. Dr. Weight shared the district has increased
efficiencies, but final transportation numbers will not be set until later this fall.
Director McDonald asked about the declining number of students being kindergarten-ready, and
inquired about which specific areas these students needed additional supports. Dr. Weight shared the
largest area of need is social emotional development. Director McDonald also praised the UFLI program
for the difference it has already made in increasing literacy rates for the district’s elementary students.
Director Rohrer asked about student supports for younger students. Dr. Weight shared the district still
offers its developmental preschool programs. The TK program would be in addition to the preschool
program.

Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

Chair Scott recognized Antoinette Walker, JBLM School Liaison Officer, who is in attendance for tonight's
meeting.
III. COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE
No comments.
IV. REPORT - Budget Status Report
Shawn Lewis, Assistant Superintendent, shared budget status reports for all funds as of the end of
August 2024, along with charts and data showing monthly attendance, general fund balance, and
general fund cash balance.
Mr. Lewis shared he expects the district will have a final ending fund balance this year that meets the 6%
of prior year expenditures target.
Revenue exceeded the district's overall target for the year, in large part to the federal government
sending nearly $500,000 more than originally anticipated. Annual expenses came in under budget for
the year, due in large part to the capital levy addressing costs for non-voted debt, technology, and
capital safety expenses. The Capital Projects Fund ends the year with just over $1 million in fund balance
after a transfer of $1.625 million for a debt service payment due in December. The ASB fund will end the
year spending about $50,000 more than revenue, but this is a positive as they are spending down excess
fund balance.
Director Rohrer had a question regarding the citizens’ capital project committee, asking how long will
the committee meet before bringing a plan before the board. Mr. Lewis shared the original plan was to
meet at least through February 2025, but he wants to leave the date open for the committee to decide
when they are ready to present a plan.
Director Lewis asked if the district was able to get back to the 6% minimum fund balance faster than
originally anticipated. Mr. Lewis shared that is indeed the case.
Chair Scott pointed out all the good work Mr. Lewis and district staff have done to get the district's
budget back on track.
V. CONSENT AGENDA
Director Lewis made a motion to approve the Consent Agenda, Director Rohrer seconded the motion,
and the motion passed (5/0).
The Consent Agenda consisted of Approval of August and September 2024 Accounts Payable and August
2024 Payroll; Approval of the August 21, 2024 Regular Board Meeting Minutes; Approval of Personnel
Reports; Approval of ESD112 DOL CDL Services Agreement; an Approval of Pacific Lutheran University
and SHSD MOU.
VI. OLD BUSINESS - Adoption of 2024-25 Board Governance Goals
Dr. Weight shared that, annually, the board conducts a self-assessment to evaluate its own performance
in terms of generally accepted principles of successful board operations and the Washington School
Board Standards. The Board reviews the results of their self-assessment and uses the results as a part of
their governance goal setting process (consistent with Board Policies 1810 and 1820).
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

Page 2 of 4

Packet page 106 of 132

All five Board members completed their assessment on June 21, 2024. Results were tabulated by
WSSDA. The Board’s 2023-24 Governance Goals were adopted in December 2023.
At the August 21, 2024 Regular Board Meeting, the Board expressed interested in the continuation of
these governance goals for 2024-25, in lieu of choosing new focus areas.
Director Rohrer made a motion to approve the adoption of the 2024-25 Board Governance Goals,
Director Tinsley seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
VII. NEW BUSINESS
A. First Reading of Policy 3241 Student Discipline
Susanne Beauchaine, Executive Director of Human Resources, shared Policy 3241 Student
Discipline. OSPI has filed emergency rules clarifying and updating Chapter 392-400 WAC related
to Student Discipline. These rules are effective immediately, and the permanent rules are
anticipated to be in effect by the 2025-2026 school year. The emergency rules clarify the
definition of classroom exclusion and includes the definitions of discretionary and nondiscretionary discipline from RCW 28A.600.015(6). Policy 3241 is revised to align with these legal
updates and for clarity.
Director McDonald made a motion to approve Policy 3241 Student Discipline, Director Rohrer
seconded the motion, and the motion passed (5/0).
Director Tinsley asked why OSPI files emergency rules. Ms. Beauchaine explained disruptive
student conduct has caused districts to request changes be made.
Director Rohrer shared she was surprised to see language disappear from the policy. She
questioned how clarity would be provided in the future. She asked if charts would still be
provided. Ms. Beauchaine shared the district took board feedback on what would happen when
- and they updated the discipline matrix which is already available on the website. Principals are
also working with their staff on interventions for students.
B. Board Goal - Professional Learning
Chair Scott shared that the WSSDA Direct article on binding conditions and oversight should be
read by the board. He also read the article, "Thirteen Mistakes Board Members Make." He
shared he feels the board has avoided almost all of the mentioned mistakes with the exception
of having their own personal agenda. Because this particular area has been an issue in the past,
he believes this article is good reading for the directors. "Why Board/Superintendent
Relationships Matter," is another article he suggested the board read. Finally, he suggested the
directors read an article on effective collaboration.
Director Rohrer shared about the WSSDA General Assembly coming up this weekend. This is a
very important weekend for priorities, policy, and funding issues. Director Tinsley shared WSSDA
dissolved the weighted vote last year.
Director Lewis shared he is working toward being an effective member of the board by fully
understanding the role of WSSDA and completing more professional learning reading.
Regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors of the Steilacoom Historical School District No. 1 are digitally recorded.

X. ADJOURNMENT

motion, and the motion passed (5/0).

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The 2023-2026 Continuous School Improvement Plans (CSIP) were adopted on October
18, 2023, and through our monitoring process, school teams have completed a thorough
review and analysis of multiple data points, including the spring Washington School
Improvement Framework (WSIF) and Smarter Balanced (SBA) data. This process led to an
update and revision of school goals, ensuring they reflect the most recent data. School
teams have developed new action steps to replace those that were successfully completed
in the 23-24 school year, and they are excited to continue making progress toward
achieving these goals.
Each Continuous School Improvement Plan continues to serve as a central hub for school
data, outlining clear, measurable objectives for student outcomes and detailing the
collaborative efforts required to achieve them. The CSIPs provide families and community
members with a transparent view of the schools' commitment to continuous improvement,
fostering a shared understanding of our long-term goals.
Schools designated as Title I or identified under the Washington School Improvement
Framework (WSIF) have conducted comprehensive needs assessments, as required. The
results of these assessments were shared during a Board Briefing in the fall of 2023 and
have played a key role in shaping the updated goals and action steps in their respective
plans.
Each plan is designed with three focused goals, supported by actionable steps that can be
completed within the school year. As steps are accomplished, they will be replaced with
new actions to ensure ongoing progress until the overarching goals are met.

Goal 1
Increase the average student and staff self-reported data regarding sense of belonging by one
statistical measure between August 2023 and June 2024.
Action Steps:
SHS will create a program called The Steilly Way Show, which is a more strategic look at our
culture using student voice and leadership. It's a monthly episodic look at the culture of SHS,
filmed, edited, and produced completely by our students, and airing during advisory
Adopting College in the High School programming helps provide students with more
support; creating an equity team for educators on topics like Culturally Responsive
Education in the Classroom and participating in the Stembridge Residency helps move this
work forward
SHS has an instructional focus is on the revised Danielson framework, specifically the
sections about vertical alignment of key content and literacy; Literacy support also comes
via our ongoing work with GLAD strategies to strengthen literacy in every classroom
SHS is partnering with our CTE classes to highlight the culture of our students in public
spaces, like building an ofrenda for Dia De Los Muertos, creating a native mural in our
welcoming space, having students articulate the importance of land acknowledgements at
every staff meeting, and creating an international hallway; We have also created a culture
club for students to share their stories during WIN

Goal 2
Increase the proficiency rate for Black and Hispanic students in Math and ELA by two
statistical measures on our year-end Washington State School Improvement Factors
(WSIF) score.
Action Steps:
Teachers will nest student growth goals with specific sub-groups as the focus utilizing
both micro and macro data
Growth goal (& SIP-specific) data will be looked at biweekly by MTSS team and
monthly by PLC and Department Leaders
Based on the learning in year one, we decided to capitalize on the opportunity to
partner with GLAD in year two. Literacy skills in every classroom will help our data for
the subgroups we are trying to target

Goal 3
Redesign our student discipline systems to proactively address behavior and decrease
recidivism while ensuring that our students furthest from educational justice are not
disproportionately excluded from a learning environment.
Action Steps:
SHS will collect, review, and discuss low and high level discipline entries as they are
disaggregated by age, gender, demographic, academics, and cross-referenced with
entries in attendance and academic categories as well
The administration will work with teacher leaders, counselors, and the restorative
center para in order to create, manage, and review systems that allow for the most
clear and actionable data to be presented.
