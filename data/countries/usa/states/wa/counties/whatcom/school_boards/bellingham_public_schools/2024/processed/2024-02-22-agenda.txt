Recommended Action :

Samish, which as superintendent I have reviewed and

Public Content
Staff Contact: Jay Jordan, Assistant Superintendent of Teaching and Learning
Explanation of Issue:
Each year, all fifth graders in our district have the opportunity for an overnight field trip to North Cascades Institute (NCI), focused on outdoor
learning and environmental education. These outdoor learning experiences align with fifth grade science standards and serve as rich
learning and an exciting trip for students before they head off to middle school.
Unfortunately, due to fall wildfires that have affected NCI, many of our schools fall outdoor experiences have had to be postponed or even
cancelled, by no fault of NCI.
To continue to provide this rich learning experience for our students, and to be able to plan effectively and predictably for school schedules,
our district has added a second site for outdoor learning: Camp Kirby, which is located on Samish Island on Padilla Bay in Skagit County.
Starting this school year, all elementary schools will take their outdoor education trip in the spring, and we will be able to maintain a twonight, three-day learning experience, with half of our schools going to NCI and half to Camp Kirby.
