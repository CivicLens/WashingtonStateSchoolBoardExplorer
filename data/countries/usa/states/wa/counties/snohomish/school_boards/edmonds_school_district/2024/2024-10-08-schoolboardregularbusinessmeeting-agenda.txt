Second Reading, Approve Revised Board Policy 3205 - Sexual Harassment of Students Prohibited
Background:
There were no changes to this policy between the first and second reading.

In accordance with state requirements, our district's Sexual Harassment of Students Prohibited policy
(Board Policy 3205) needs to be updated to ensure continued compliance with 2024 Title IX regulations.
The current policy, last revised in 2021, does not meet the comprehensive and detailed standards now
required by state and federal guidelines. The newly proposed policy, adapted from the Washington State
School Directors' Association (WSSDA) Model policy is consistent with the 2024 Title IX regulations.

West Construction, the highest rated firm to provide General Contractor/Construction Manager (GC/CM)

Background:

In accordance with RCW 39.10, District personnel have determined Spee West Construction of

consideration. If the Board approved the GMP, it would be executed as an amendment to the contract
recommended in this item.

The Capital Projects Office recommends a preliminary budget authorization of $20,000,000 for Design
and Preconstruction services. The team anticipates a multiple GMP project, including the possibility of
early procurement. Once a GMP has been negotiated with Spee West Construction, staff will recommend
additional budget authorization. No construction would occur without Board authorization.
