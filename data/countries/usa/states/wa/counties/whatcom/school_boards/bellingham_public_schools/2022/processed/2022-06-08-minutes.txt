INFORMATIONAL ITEMS
GP-7.2 – 2021-22 Annual Board Agenda, Revised – no action needed.
School Board Directors’ Reports. Highlights of comments:
• Mr. Benjamin attended a WSSDA Board of Directors meeting on May 20 and the
WSSDA Director Area 1 regional meeting on May 24, which was also attended by
Dr. Baker. The primary focus of the regional meeting was to learn from region 1
directors what WSSDA is doing well and what could be improved upon. Mr.
Benjamin attended Columbia Elementary School’s International Baccalaureate (IB)
verification visit last week and enjoyed attending the retirement dinner. The board
visited Silver Beach Elementary yesterday, and he found the deeper look into reading
curriculum fascinating. He shared that he learned of the school shooting in Uvalde,
Texas on his way to the WSSDA regional meeting and stated that gun safety and gun
control are needed. It is not a mental health problem, and he hopes support will be
shown for a public health initiative regarding firearms.
• Ms. Mason noted that she was sorry to miss yesterday’s visit to Silver Beach
Elementary. She participated in the IB verification visit for Carl Cozier and was
pleased to learn how exceptional Bellingham Public Schools is for its expansive IB
offerings. She was happy to learn of Ms. Feeney’s new position in the district and
thought the retirement celebration was incredible. She has had many opportunities to
speak with queer youth this month, and it’s very meaningful how accepting this
district is of all students. It means a lot to a lot of people, including those who do not
even have a connection to the district. She also is happy that the board is meeting in
person this evening.
• Ms. Diaz Hackler and her husband both enjoyed the retirement dinner. It is always
such a lovely event and it’s nice to recognize and appreciate those who have
dedicated their lives to children. She noted that many of her own kids’ teachers are
now retiring. The students who participated in the Silver Beach visit were amazing.
• Ms. Bashaw agrees that the retirement dinner was an incredible event, and she has
missed it taking place over the past two years because of COVID restrictions. She
appreciates the countless hours that were put in to make it such a nice event. The
Silver Beach visit was impressive. She attended the youth pride parade and noted that
it’s great to see how the community supports our youth. She wonders if WSSDA will
be planning a coordinated effort to ensure school boards are creating a climate where
students are comfortable confiding in adults, and Mr. Benjamin stated he will inquire
with WSSDA.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• Five-year graduation rates for Bellingham students continue to improve while dropout rates
continue to decline overall and for many identified subgroups of students.
• The number of Career and Technical Education (CTE) industry certifications earned by
Bellingham students increased significantly once again this year, continuing a trend we have
observed over the past several years.
• During the summer months of 2020, more than 17,000 books were mailed to 1,400 students at
all 14 of our elementary schools. Each student participating received an average of 12 books
each.
• One hundred percent attendance of parents for IEP meetings, even with families who speak
languages other than English.
• The amount of families served by the meal box program during COVID.
DB:
• The district appears to be approaching the point where you cannot distinguish between
students of various ethnic and socioeconomic status by their graduation rates. This is
significant progress towards a very high bar.
• It is impressive to see the district drill down on various psychological factors (such as hope,
optimism and determination) and how they are directly related to academic achievement and
performance. And in turn develop programing that fosters and promotes these factors.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
There is clear evidence that the superintendent and district worked very hard and maintained
flexibility in meeting the unprecedented and unpredictable demands of the pandemic on the
school calendar.
Adapting and responding to the additional, unique needs of students coming back to school in
Fall 2021 (with respect to the pandemic), including shifting schedules to allow for more planning,
deploying instructional coaches and having “all hands-on deck” to cover staff shortages due to
illness.
The Family Engagement team once again shows how critical they are to the backbone of our
district and family wellness. The work of this team to meet student/family needs is a really strong
point for this district and something to be proud of.
Testing, vaccination, refugee support, Latinx community engagement and support for families
through the Family Resource Center (FRC) highlights not just how deeply students’ ability to
learn and thrive is impacted by the community but also how deeply important public schools are
to our community as a whole.
