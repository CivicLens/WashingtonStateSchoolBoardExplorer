The adoption of the 6-8 Science curriculum is a subcategory of the 6-12 Science adoption. High school science curriculum will
come to the Board for adoption later this spring. The middle school science curriculum for Battle Ground Public Schools was last
adopted in 2007. The curriculum being recommended now integrates the four content domains of the Next Generation Science
Standards (NGSS): Physical science, Life science, Earth and Space science, and Engineering, Technology, and Applications of
science. This proposal comes with the endorsement from the Instructional Materials Committee (IMC) that the adoption process
for this proposal has met all requirements of Board Policy 2020 and Procedure 2020P.

Type :

Action (Consent)

Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors approve the second reading and
adoption of the recommended curriculum for the following
high school social studies courses as presented.

Public Content
Background:
High school social studies core curricula were last adopted in 2016. The courses listed below are the only social studies courses
being considered in this adoption. Specialized courses (for example: History Through Film) do not need a new curriculum at this
time. Social studies courses taught through Career and Technical Education (for example: Crime and Society) are also not part
of this proposal. AP Social Studies curricula were recently adopted this past winter. With respect to Contemporary World
Problems (CWP), Upfront Magazine has been used in the past at some of our high schools as a supplemental curriculum.
Adding them to this adoption will, if approved, add consistency to all our CWP courses. All the curricula listed below support the
Washington State learning standards in Social Studies. This proposal comes with the endorsement from the Instructional
Materials Committee (IMC) that the adoption process for this proposal has met all requirements of Board Policy 2020 and
Procedure 2020P.

Type :

Public Content
Presenter:
Kevin Jolma
Executive Directors of Facilities and Operations
Background:
Resolution B-24 approves the District to surplus and sell the Chelatchie property the District owns. The lot has an old dilapidated
timber structure that once housed the Tum Tum School District (TTSD) #105.
In 1942 the TTSD became part of the Yacolt School District Battle Ground School District (BGSD) #119. At that time it was
determined the Log Cabin would no longer serve students. In 1935, before the BGSD consolidation, the property was conveyed
via a Life Estate to the Tum Tum Log Cabin Club (TTLCC). That meant that as long as the TTLCC was in existence they could
occupy the property. If the TTLCC were ever to be terminated the property would then revert to the Grantor (TTSD).
In 2013 it was determined that all members of the TTLCC had passed away and the Club no longer existed. The property then
reverted to the Grantor- which was then BGSD who had consolidated with TTSD in 1942. The property has been vacant since
2013. A timeline of relevant School District consolidations is attached.
The Chelatchie property (Parcel 2743480000) is 1 acre in size and the County Zoning is Rural Center Residential (2.5-acre lot
size). The log cabin is very dilapidated and requires upkeep. Due to its vacancy, it also presents a potential liability.

This surplus is the first step in selling the 1-acre parcel which is not needed for future education needs by the District.

The Board of Directors to approve the District-Wide

Public Content
Presenter:
Kevin Jolma
Executive Director of Facilities and Operations
Background:

This $231,414.77 contract (excluding sales tax) is to perform the scheduled replacement of HVAC air
filters in the air handling equipment in the District's buildings. This is a three-year service agreement.
In 2014 the District determined that it was beneficial to outsource the HVAC filter servicing of our
buildings. It has proved to be more efficient than utilizing in-district personnel to service the filters, thereby
freeing up our personnel to do maintenance work instead.
This project is funded by the Maintenance Department's annual budget.

Kevin Jolma
Executive Director of Facilities and Operations
Background:
Due to continued growth, PVP needs additional classrooms. The District shall convert a large covered play area into 3 new
classrooms on the East side of the building.
The District routinely utilizes our Small Works bidding process (which does not require advertising) for projects less than
$350,000. This project is estimated to be approximately $1 Million and therefore needs to be publicly advertised and bid.
RCW 28A.335.190 requires the district to advertise for furniture, supplies, equipment, building, improvements or repairs, or other
work or purchases, except books whenever the estimated cost is more than $75,000. The advertisement must be published in at
least one newspaper of general circulation within the district, once each week for two consecutive weeks.

After the project bids, the Board will then need to approve the award of the contract.
This project is funded by Impact Fees.

In order to properly place and maintain the public utilities and provide for inspection of stormwater facilities for the CAM Academy
project, the District needs to enter into an agreement with the City of Battle Ground to allow easements on District property.
The use of the water easement by the City of Battle Ground will be limited to constructing, installing, reconstructing, enlarging,
repairing, operating, and maintenance of water pipelines, hydrants, meters, and reading and recording meters.
The stormwater covenant will provide the City of Battle Ground access to the stormwater control and treatment facilities for
inspection of the facilities for compliance with the citys
Stormwater Control Ordinance.

Background:
In the planning phase of the CAM Academy project, it was determined that the proposed location for the campus spanned three
separate District-owned parcels, with existing and new buildings located on parcel boundary lines. This document will adjust the
boundaries of three (3) separate parcels to encompass the campus into one (1) parcel. Also included in the document are two 60
access easements to provide access to a public street.
To satisfy the City of Battle Ground requirements, a Boundary Line Adjustment must be submitted to the City and recorded as
part of the CAM Academy project.
