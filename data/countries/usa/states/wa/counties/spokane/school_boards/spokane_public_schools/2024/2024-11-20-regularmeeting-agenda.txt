Peoples Acknowledgment
Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contributed their
hopes, dreams, and energy to making the history that led to this moment. Some were brought here against
their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on this
land since time immemorial.
Truth and acknowledgment are critical to building mutual respect and connection across all barriers of heritage
and difference, so we begin this meeting acknowledging that we are on the ancestral lands of the Spokane
Tribe of Indians and a multitude of tribes who are connected through shared history of trade, celebration, and
resources.
We make this acknowledgment to pay respects to their elders past and present whose knowledge remains on
the land. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and
settlement that bring us together here today. And please join us in continuing to learn about such truths and
actions that we can take towards restorative justice.
This land acknowledgment was developed by the US Dept of Arts and culture, revised by BHT in partnership
with regional tribes, tribal organizations, and Eastern WA University.

Recommendation:
Approve issuance of purchase orders to Amend Music, Spokane, WA and Sweetwater Sound,
LLC, Fort Wayne, IN for music instruments, not to exceed the amount of $300,000.
Tabulation:
See Attached.
Background:
With the move of 6th grade students into middle schools, the district supported a full-year choice
option for band, choir and orchestra, which created a need for additional instrument purchases
to ensure students have instruments for the entire year. Because of this program, there has
been a large increase in music retention at the high school level. To equitably provide
instruments for high schools, a plan was developed to allow for the purchase of instruments on a
yearly basis to replace old instruments that are beyond repair, and to help provide school
instruments for the growing number of students who cannot afford to rent or own.
Prices on this bid will remain firm through August 31, 2025, so the district can access this bid as
needs arise for the remainder of this fiscal year. It is recommended that the board authorize
approval of the item pricing and allow the district to make purchases as deemed necessary as
funding permits, not to exceed $300,000 without further board approval. The expenditures
resulting from this recommendation will come out of the districts general fund.
