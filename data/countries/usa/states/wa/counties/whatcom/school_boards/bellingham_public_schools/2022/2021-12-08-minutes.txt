identify who is sending the threatening messages. He noted that each time the police

Despite all that is going on, the board continues to be impressed with the great job that Dr. Baker
is doing during this stressful and difficult time. The Board appreciates his continued work to
ensure the district is in good standing and following appropriate actions. This also includes all of
the work on the policies with the executive team, support staff and legal counsel to review and
update the policies. Prior to last year the notion of a zoom meeting and a “retreat” would have
been almost contradictory and the Board appreciates the efforts that have led to continuation of
our work as much as possible during the pandemic.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
The District has made commendable progress around EDI in the past year, throughout many
actions, initiatives, and responses. This has included the development a bias and hate-related
incident reporting system, utilizing a consultant to help recruit staff from the Russian and Punjabi
communities, and the excellent process used for selection the new BHS mascot. The Board also
recognizes the importance of strengthening partnerships with the Lummi and Nookasck Tribes
that goes beyond simply meeting State requirements. It should also be noted that the District
continues its expansion of mental health services, including through Peer-Centered Outreach
groups and other prevention-intervention work.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.
The Board recognizes that while there is much to work to be done in interrupting systemic
inequities, it does not believe there are areas that are being overlooked at this time.
4. Comments on the report itself.
The Board appreciates all of the evidence and notation of “new”, “updated” and
ongoing” work. Thank you for all of the evidence of new projects and updates on current ones.

2. Please note commendable progress over the last year.
KB:
• Continued evidence of communication and counsel to the board even in very difficult times.
DB:
• This report speaks for itself. It is full of many examples of how the Superintendent keeps the
board informed, just the single metric of over 800 “Board Updates” in the past year is
remarkable. His reports to the board at meetings, and even informal lunch meetings with
individual board members, are always thoughtful, thorough and well prepared. Of the many
talents our Superintendent brings to the district, his communications with the board (and
community) ranks high on the list. I (we) would be hard-pressed to ask as for more.
JM:
• Consistent communications throughout COVID-19 and a variety of other events.
• This is an area that the Superintendent does particularly well. The Board is always kept wellinformed and given the opportunity to ask questions and get timely responses.
3. Please note areas for additional improvement.

• None.

KB:
• Excellent, especially given the circumstances of having to transition to remote learning.

• Going forward, work that is underway to increase both student voice and parent voice to the
board could be additional evidence of compliance under 2.c.iii.

• Appreciate all of the specifics.
