Recommended Action :

The Board of Directors approve the contract for Prairie
High School Main Gymnasium Floor Replacement utilizing
the Sourcewell Purchasing Cooperative.

Public Content
Presenter:
Kevin Jolma
Executive Director of Facilities
Background:
This Sourcewell Cooperative/FieldTurf USA, Inc. contract is for the replacement of the gymnasium flooring at Prairie High
School. This new floor will replace the existing floor from the original construction in 1978.
The existing floor is a typical, wooden, floating floor system. The wood flooring lies on top of wood strips that allow for movement
in the system.
The new floor will be very similar to the Omnisports Lumaflex floors installed in the gyms at Pleasant Valley and Amboy in 2021.
This floor will look similar but is a different system as the previous floors were installed directly over existing coated membrane
floors. This project will remove the floating system and replace with a new solid flooring system.
Area of work includes the gymnasium court floor. Work to be completed under this contract includes removal of the existing
wood floor; installation of rigid insulation; installation of a layer of plywood; installation of an underlayment isolation sheet;
installation of new flooring material; seam welding, and painting of game lines and the school logo. In addition, this project will
remove and replace the bleachers as well to allow re-flooring underneath.
As the new system is a resilient sheet product that will not require waxing every year nor refinishing every seven years it will

This project is levy funded.
