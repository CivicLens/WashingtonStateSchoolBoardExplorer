Action, Ordinances: 1.
ORDINANCE NO 23-18 - AN ORDINANCE AMENDING ORDINANCE NO. 22-25
ADOPTED NOVEMBER 29, 2022, AND ENTITLED "AN ORDINANCE ADOPTING A
BIENNIAL BUDGET FOR THE CITY OF PULLMAN FOR THE BIENNIUM 2023-2024".
Motion by Pat Wright, second by Becky Dueben.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Francis Benjamin, Becky Dueben, Megan Guido, Eileen Macoll, Ann Parks, Pat Wright
At 7:23 p.m., Mayor Johnson announced he was adjourning the regular meeting of Pullman
City Council and convening the special meeting of the Metropolitan Parks District.
At 7:25 p.m., Mayor Johnson adjourned the special meeting of the Metropolitan Parks District
and reconvened the regular meeting of the Pullman City Council.
Action, Ordinances: 2.
City Attorney Thaddeus O'Sullivan explained the Washington State Legislature adopted RCW
3.62.090 (Public Safety and Education Assessment) in 2019, that required courts to impose
Public Safety and Education Assessments ("PSEA's") assessments in addition to fines for
violation of city and other ordinances. The assessments were calculated as a percentage of the
imposed fine.
With the PSEA required by RCW 3.62.090, the total for a $100.00 fine would be $205. Base fine
$100 + Subsection (1) PSEA assessment (70% of base fine) $70 + Additional PSEA assessment
(50% of subsection (1) PSEA assessment) $35 = $205.
However, the correspondence with Whitman County shows they are basing the PSEA amounts
on the $500 max fine. With the addition of Public Safety and Education Assessments ("PSEA's"),
the total cost of a $500 fine is $1,025 after $525 ($350+$175) in PSEA assessments. The Court
has calculated the PSEA based on the $500 amount rather than the $100. So, an off-leash
infraction would result in a total cost of $1,025. The use of the $500 base fine is due to conflicting
language in the existing Ordinance.
PCC 9.01.030(1) identifies violation of PCC 9.20.030 (Dog Control – Specifically – Leash
required – Exception) as a civil infraction with a fine "not to exceed the sum of $500," but later
allows forfeiture to the "Whitman County District Court a penalty equal to a Class 3 infraction."
Per PCC 1.02.020, the assessment amount for a Class 3 infraction is $100.
The existing code does not require a $500 fine; it only sets the ceiling at $500.00. Without any
revision, the fine can be set at $100 (Class 3 Infraction).

To keep the consistency of code PCC 9.01.030, as shown in the proposed Ordinance, remove
the reference to $500 and eliminate the unintended consequences of the $500 reference.
ORDINANCE NO. 23-19 - AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF PULLMAN AMENDING
SECTION 9.01.030 OF THE PULLMAN MUNICIPAL CODE FOR CONSISTENCY
THROUGHOUT RELATING TO CERTAIN CIVIL PENALTIES AND RELATED FINES
AND OTHER MATTERS PROPERLY RELATED THERETO.
Motion by Ann Parks, second by Francis Benjamin.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Francis Benjamin, Becky Dueben, Megan Guido, Eileen Macoll, Ann Parks, Pat Wright
Action, Resolutions: 3.
Pullman Parks & Facilities Director Kurt Dahman stated that the Cemetery Committee developed
and approved the proposed Fee Schedule for Grave Site and Services at their meeting on
November 8, 2023. Also, on November 8, 2023, the Park & Recreation Commission voted its
approval to forward the amended fee schedule to the City Council for consideration and approval
to take effect on January 1, 2024.
The last cemetery fee increases were in 2003 and 2015. The proposed fee schedule addresses
staff and the Cemetery Committee's goals of increasing revenues to counter the rising cost of
perpetual care and expansion, keeping fees comparable to other cemeteries, and adjusting fees
to reflect the industry trend toward cremation and away from traditional earth burials.
RESOLUTION NO. R-59-23 - A RESOLUTION ADOPTING FEES FOR GRAVE SITES
AND SERVICES FOR CITY OF PULLMAN CEMETERIES AND RESCINDING THE
SCHEDULE OF FEES FOR GRAVE SITES AND SERVICES ADOPTED BY
RESOLUTION NO. R-34-15.
Motion by Becky Dueben, second by Pat Wright.
Final Resolution: Motion Carries
Yea: Francis Benjamin, Becky Dueben, Megan Guido, Eileen Macoll, Ann Parks, Pat Wright
Action, Resolutions: 4.
City Clerk Dee Stiles-Elliott stated that using electronic documents and signatures provides an
efficient, effective, and secure means for conducting private and public business. During the
2020 legislative session, the Washington State Legislature adopted the Uniform
Electronics Transactions Act, Chapter 1.80 RCW, effective June 11, 2020, which allows
municipalities to determine whether and the extent to which the agency will send and accept
electronic signatures in its business. This Resolution and the attached Electronic Signature
Policy promote efficiency in conserving public resources, establishing guidelines for using
electronic signatures for certain City transactions and providing reasonable assurances of
integrity, authenticity, and nonrepudiation of electronic documents. The Resolution and
Electronic Signature Policy requires IT to approve an electronic signature provider.
RESOLUTION NO. R-60-23 - A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY
OF PULLMAN AUTHORIZING THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES IN THE CITY
OF PULLMAN AND ADOPTING AN ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE POLICY AND
MATTERS PROPERLY RELATED THERETO.
Motion by Becky Dueben, second by Eileen Macoll.
